Are you okay?

17
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,030
It's a misunderstanding, Mr. Liu.

18
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,230
A misunderstanding?

19
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,290
How audacious of you.

20
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,880
Do you know who he is?

Why am I here?

29
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,240
that was an honest mistake.

00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,570
Did I allow you to speak?

31
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,700
How did he hit you just now?

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,730
Hit him back.

33
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,710
Forget it.

34
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,630

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,750
please hear me out.

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,280

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,890

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,780

65
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,890
Captain Qin.

66

Someone

67
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,409
commented the news
about the Hangang Center incident,

68
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,630
saying that the report is wrong

69
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,060
and that there was a fatality
at the site.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,010
We meant to ask him for more information,

71
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,210
but he wouldn't talk.

72
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,790
Who?

73
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,330
[Wrong. A death at the construction site.]
[Hello. Can we talk?]

74
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,210
Go find him.

75
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,540
Ask him what happened

76
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,270
and why he posted this comment.

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
Treat him as a rumor monger
if he doesn't tell the truth.

We found out who smeared us online

81
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,480
when we arrested Zheng Gao

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,210
previously.

83
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,260
Liu Tianfei hired him.

84
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,860
The middleman was Xu Jiajun.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,140
Uncle Tianfei?

86
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,200
Got it.

87
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,950
I'll follow up on that.

88
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Continue.

89
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,180
Xin.

90
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,540
Xin,

91
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,370
there you are.

92
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,120
I was just out for a meeting.

93
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,680
Your assistant...

94
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,070
Named Meng Yu, right?

95
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,380
Why isn't she with you?

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,750
She has resigned.

97
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,910
Shall we go for a ride?

98
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,830
Please let me take a rest.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,310
I think you have a real talent
for horse riding.

100
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,310
You're even getting better than me.

101
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,690
That's not true.

102
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,880
It all thanks to you
for being a great tutor.

103
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,510
Have you thought about
keeping your own horse?

104
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,970
I'm still just a beginner.

105
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,950
It's too soon to think about that.

106
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,750
Preparation is not necessarily a must

107
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,610
before action.

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
But now,

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,820
I have too much going on

110
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,530
both at home

111
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,270
and in the company.

112
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,680
There's very little time for myself.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,920
How can I find time
to take care of a horse?

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,800
You can consult your brother
about company affairs.

115
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
He and you are family.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,630
Why do everything on your own?

117
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,960
I hate to rely on others,

118
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,480
especially my brother.

119
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,320
Business and family

120
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,080
had better be separated.

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,530
You're just like your brother,

122
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,190
so respectful of boundaries.

123
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,450
If the two of you joined forces,

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,530
there might not be a place
for me and Xinrui Group.

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,770
You're joking again.

126
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,010
Xin,

127
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,630
how's the Hangang Center incident
being handled?

128
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
Everything's fine.

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,940
Hasn't your brother told you?

130
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,770
No. Maybe he's too busy to inform me.

131
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,260
Come on, have some fruit.

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,000
Thank you.

133
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,970
What do you think of this

134
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,400
newly arrived wine?

135
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,169
It's okay.

136
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,450
It agrees well with me.

137
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,720
But I'm telling you,

138
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
everything works for me,

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,810
as long as it's alcohol.

140
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,290
It strikes me as a little light-bodied.

141
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,090
Mediocre, I'd say.

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,800
I agree.

143
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,720
This wine is beneath us.

144
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,480
Anything wrong, Tianye?

145
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,650
Baoshuai!

146
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,000
Mr. Wei forsook his construction business

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,250
for smuggling liquor

148
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,450
without telling me.

149
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,970
Mr. Liu,

150
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm so sorry.

151
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,940
I beg for a second chance,

152
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,540
Mr. Liu.

153
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,420
I understand

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,040
that you're eager to make money.

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,000
But there are certain types of business

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,050
you can't touch.

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Mr. Wei told me that it was you

158
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
who encouraged him to do smuggling,

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,730
and that you invested much money in it.

160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,150
Is that true?

161
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,540
Tianye,

162
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,580
I...

163
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,840
Last month, you spent a fortune

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,780
on two watches.

165
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,350
Where did you hide them?

166
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,190
They're...

167
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,310
in my apartment downtown.

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,850
I bought that apartment for Jiangyan.

169
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,470
Jiajun.

170
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,330
Jiangyan

171
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,510
is my only sister.

172
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,170
I can't just watch you lie to her

173
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,750
and do nothing.

174
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Tianye,

175
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,530
we're all family here.

176
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,060
Let's talk things through.

177
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,470
I'll take Mr. Wei out now.

178
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,350
Tianye...

179
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
Well, Tianye,

180
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,630
I bet Jiajun knows he has done wrong.

181
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,360
Such seriousness is uncalled for.

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,340
I'm sorry, Tianye.

183
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,670
Tianye,

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,050
I admit

185
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm in the wrong.

186
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,170
I was just

187
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
desperate to make money

188
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
and to build my own business.

189
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,030
That was why I foolishly...

190
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,840
Tianye, could you please keep it secret

191
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,700
from Jiangyan?

192
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,720
I promise

193
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
there won't be a next time.

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,090
"Next time"?

195
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,520
This is enough, Tianye.

196
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
We're all family here.

197
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
"Family"?

198
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,600
What kind of family
would do such stupid things?

199
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,080
Did you two launch that smear campaign

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,680
when Zheng Gao was arrested?

201
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,150
Tianye,

202
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,190
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:51,720
I...

204
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,910
Was I asking you?

205
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,750
If you dare hide anything

206
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,550
from me again,

207
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,680
you'll die a painful death.

208
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,590
Get lost.

209
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,250
Tianye,

210
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm to blame

211
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,280
for this matter.

212
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,530
It's my fault.

213
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,610
I shouldn't have involved Jiajun.

214
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,480
However...

215
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,710
Tianye,

216
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,560
I think you're also well aware

217
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,060
that Feng has been coming after us
frantically for years...

218
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,050
Shut up.

219
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,800
What was it for when we took

220
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,340
all that trouble to clean up the mess?

221
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,470
We only did it to redirect the flak
to Zhang Xin.

222
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,000
Why did you pull that stunt?

223
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,900
Wouldn't Qin Feng investigate it himself?

224
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,420
Uncle Tianye, actually...

225
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,550
I'm partly to blame.

226
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,670
If I hadn't lost the cufflinks

227
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,340
and...

228
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,020
Alright, stop it, Baoshuai.

229
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,430
You stay out of this.

230
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,110
It has nothing to do with you.

231
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,400
This is my fault,

232
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,630
entirely.

233
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,700
Tianye,

234
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,750
I've already owned up to it,

235
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,410
alright?

236
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,880
To be honest,

237
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Feng has been after us

238
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,940
over these many years.

239
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,540
Right?

240
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,220
Tell me.

241
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,060
What else could I have done?

242
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,820
We're family.

243
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,420
Would I have possibly hurt him?

244
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,060
But there had to be
an answer to his actions,

245
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,020
or a solution, right?

246
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,350
That can't justify what you did!

247
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,550
Then what do you think I should've done?

248
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,630
Does Feng even take us as his family?

249
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,270
He's now trying to tear

250
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,450
the family apart.

251
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,820
Don't you understand?

252
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,870
-Why don't you let me speak?
-Stop running your mouth.

253
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,700
Go on.

254
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,550
I'm listening.

255
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,550
Tucked right into my pocket.
Tucked right into my pocket.

256
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,510
Back then, how do you think Ma Jin

257
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,380
and Luo Bo figured out we took the money?

258
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,980
Would Jiangyong have died
if you had kept your hands to yourself?

259
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,740
Look what has become

260
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,410
of you in recent years.

261
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
A complete mess
living in a drunken stupor.

262
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,680
I know you're upset
about Jiangyong's death.

263
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,620
I'm not blaming you.

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,680
We're all responsible for his death.

265
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,460
But Tianfei,

266
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,400
you can't go on in this way.

267
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,960
The family needs you.

268
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,220
Alright.

269
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,370
Enough.

270
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,710
Stop it, Tianfei.

271
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,390
Stop it!

272
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,070
It's time you quit drinking.

273
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,090
Tianye.

274
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,890
Tianye!

275
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,980
So far, Liu Tianye has only found out

276
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,710
the business I did with Mr. Wei.

277
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,690
He doesn't know about

278
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
our dealings yet.

279
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
He got so mad

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,030
over such a minor issue.

281
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,960
They still haven't accepted you.

282
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,050
Those from Longwan
are just a bunch of country bumpkins

283
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,070
who only trust their relatives.

284
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,740
They're no different
than those heinous landlords

285
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,870
from centuries ago.

286
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,040
Ms. Zhang.

287
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm fed up with staying in Longwan.

288
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
I want to work for you.

289
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,410
You're one of Longwan people now.

290
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,540
If they know you've turned to me,

291
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,260
your life will become even more difficult.

292
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,290
One of Longwan people?

293
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,550
Has any of them ever treated me
as one of Longwan people?

294
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,820
They all look down on me,

295
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,500
calling me an outsider
who sponges off his wife.

296
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,190
Every day, I'm like walking on eggshells
around Liu Tianye.

297
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm so sick of this pathetic life.

298
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,670
I'll divorce his sister if I have to.

299
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,400
You must not.

300
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,960
Why not?

301
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,950
Once you leave Longwan,

302
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,040
you'll be of no use.

303
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,390
What do you mean?

304
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,040
Just stay in Longwan.

305
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,050
Perhaps

306
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,080
I'll need you for something.

307
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,670
All of you are using me as a tool,

308
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,220
right?

309
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,270
Am I a slave to you guys?

310
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,470
Ms. Zhang,

311
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,550
haven't I done much work for you
over these years?

312
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,550
You think you've worked for me?

313
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,500
I just helped you make some money.

314
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,230
Have you forgotten who you are?

315
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,670
Right.

316
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,900
Your business

317
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,530
is way out of my league.

318
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,320
I'll quit then, okay?

319
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,220
Do you think you'll get to live

320
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,460
if Liu Tianye finds out about
the dirty stuff you've been using

321
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,920
Longwan's companies for?

322
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,500
Just the money you've laundered already
amounts to dozens of millions, right?

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,040
If word gets out,

324
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,730
your wife and child
will both be implicated.

325
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,970
I get it.

326
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,580
You plan to threaten Liu Tianye
with Jiangyan.

327
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,020
What a deliberate scheme of yours.

328
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,750
It turns out
you've been having this evil plan

329
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,550
in mind
while pretending to be Jiangyan's friend.

330
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,960
Given the line of business I'm in,

331
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,160
I have to leave myself a way out.

332
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,790
I've heard

333
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,470
that you're being ousted

334
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,620
from the Hangzhou Port project.

335
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,520
Xu Jiajun,

336
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,030
just go back to Longwan
and mooch off your wife.

337
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,630
You'd better behave,

338
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,850
or I'll have your whole family

339
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,620
suffer for what you've done
in these years.

340
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,310
Xu Jiajun!

341
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,350
What's wrong, honey?

342
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,720
What is this about?

343
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,310
[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau
enforced the law violently]

344
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,190
Why would this college mate of yours

345
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,810
write such an article to criticize

346
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,609
my brother and the police force?

347
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,040
I asked him about it.

348
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,890
He said he was introduced by you!

349
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,670
Honey,

350
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,390
-sit down and hear me out.
-Don't touch me!

351
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,050
Explain it!

352
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,790
Oh, please,

353
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,920
just hear me out.

354
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,410
It's a misunderstanding.

355
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,220
I was deceived by Tianfei.

356
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,869
He asked me to introduce
someone from the press

357
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,349
to him, claiming that he was doing

358
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,579
another person a favor.

359
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,380
I didn't ask for more specifics.

360
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,630
Look what a mess it has become.

361
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,390
It's my fault for being too thoughtless.

362
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,700
Who would've known he'd do such a thing?

363
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,900
If I had realized it,

364
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,570
I wouldn't have introduced anyone to him.

365
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,770
Why didn't you tell me

366
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,730
the whole story earlier?

367
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,370
I just felt too awkward about this

368
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,530
and didn't know how to tell you about it.

369
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,190
But mainly,

370
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,370
I didn't want to worry you.

371
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,440
Drop the act!

372
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,350
How much did Liu Tianfei pay you?

373
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,980
Zero, honey.

374
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,620
How could I have taken money?

375
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,700
Honey, I admit I did wrong.

376
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,040
I should've been more careful.

378

My apologies.

379
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,950
I promise this won't happen again.

380
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,340
I'm warning you,

381
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,530
cut off contact with Liu Tianfei

382
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,740
from now on.

383
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,900
Longwan and Tianyun

384
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,460
are not associated in any way!

385
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,720
Yes, sure, honey.

386
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,010
I'm sorry.

387
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,740
I know

388
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,890
I did wrong.

389
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:15,850
Tianye.

390
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,090
Why didn't you tell me about your visit?

391
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,150
Tianfei had someone write an article
attacking Crazy.

392
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,260
Do you know that?

393
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,570
Yes.

394
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,280
Did you tell him to do so?

395
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,850
No.

396
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,640
You heard that from Jiajun?

397
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,170
Yes.

398
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,760
Now,

399
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,090
Tianyun is about to be a contractor

400
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,820
of the Hangang Center project.

401
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,540
This is a crucial time for us.

402
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,950
So I wouldn't let my people go rogue.

403
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,050
But in this matter, Tianfei and his guys

404
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,990
have really gone out of line.

405
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,290
I've reprimanded them.

406
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,750
Then keep Tianfei in line.

407
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,340
I'd hate to see anything like that
happen again.

408

How is

413
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,690
Jiajun treating you now?

414
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,380
Why ask that out of a sudden?

415
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,380
I think you should spend more time
managing

416
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700

417
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,940
Sometimes Jiajun could be too impulsive.

418
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,540
I'm worried that he might...

419
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,750
get conned.

420
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,950

All I want

422
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,470
is for you to live a better life.

423

425

it's fine for you to step down

426
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,900

565
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,950
of the Hangang Center incident,

566
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,370
but it was covered up.

567
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:47,850
Yes.

568
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,740
The task force already started

569
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
investigating it

570
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,280
in secret some time ago.

571
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,600
We've gathered

572
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,090
substantial information.

573
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,150
Have you found anything about Guazi?

574
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,920
We discovered Guazi's trails

575
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,300
exactly when we were

576
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,980
looking into Feng Jiang.

577
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,260
Director Chu,

578
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,920
we've actually

579
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,030
spent years searching for Guazi,

580
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,630
but never caught him.

581
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,590
Those people are accustomed

582
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,850
to killing witnesses.

583
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,460
Feng Jiang is in imminent danger now,

584
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,520
as Guazi is looking for him.

585
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,380
So we must keep up the pace.

586
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,760
The more you charge forward,

587
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
the more it benefits the task force.

588
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,610
Look,

589
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,460
when you obtain any relevant information,

590
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,830
report it to us promptly

591
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,380
through your mentor.

592
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,070
Does it mean I am...

593
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,960
part of the task force now?

594
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,310
What?

595
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,820
Any objection?

596
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,940
No.

597
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,290
It's just too abrupt.

598
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Director Chu,

599
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,720
the manhunt for Guazi has been underway
for many years.

600
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
It's been more than

601
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,380
three years since his last crime.

602
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,930
Mai Hongchao

603
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,510
has participated in several CI operations

604
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,170
and provided important leads

605
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,290
in the course of solving

606
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,610
multiple major cases.

607
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,690
Therefore, I think

608
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,610
he can be assigned a special role.

609
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,540
I know what you're thinking.

610
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,720
You're trying to give a mentee of yours
closure

611
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,990
and put a wish of your own to rest.

612
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,650
I agree to your idea.

613
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,750
This web of criminals in Hanzhou
is intricately,

614
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,890
complicatedly,

615
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,610
and solidly woven.

616
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,900
Now that

617
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,760
we're here with firm determination,

618
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,220
we'd better not hold back.

619
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,980
Let's use all resources within reach

620
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,240
to tear this web apart.

621
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,660
So you're well?

622
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,490
Yes.

623
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,190
But I heard from Crazy

624
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,620
that your medical report didn't look good.

625
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,870
I'm in perfect health.

626
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,320
The medical report

627
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,630
was tampered with by those

628
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,830
with ill intentions.

629
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,450
Is your leg all good now?

630
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Yes.

631
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,200
It's fine.

632
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,510
I'll be off if that's all.

633
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,090
Hold on.

634
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,520
I need to tell you something.

635
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,630
Guazi...

636
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,940
has shown up again.

637
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,390
Any leads?

638
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,370
Yes.

639
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,360
As soon as he surfaces,

640
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,360
we'll definitely catch him.

641
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,610
Take care of yourself.

642
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,250
Those dark circles under your eyes
seem worse now than before.

643
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,880
Enough.

644
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,530
Buddy,

645
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,560
you already signed the papers

646
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,680
and took the money.

647
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,140
But you backed out afterwards.

648
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,960
Really uncool, wasn't it?

649
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,180
Don't even think of filing a complaint.

650
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,740
It won't work.

651
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,680
The body's already been cremated.

652
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,790
Cops investigates cases

653
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,030
based on evidence.

654
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,600
Got it?

655
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,220
Karma will get you sooner or later.

656
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,650
You'll die a horrible death.

657
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,220
Listen,

658
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,830
when you're out of here,

659
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,430
try making wiser decisions.

660
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,550
If you're brought back here again,

661
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,180
I won't be this nice.

662
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,580
I'll chop you up.

663
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,150
You'll be cut into pieces

664
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,620
just like pork.

665
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,460
My name is Feng Jiang.

666
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,430
[Name: Feng Jiang]

667
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,560
I'm hereby making a formal allegation
about the Hangang Center incident.

668
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,930
Someone

669
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,330
has colluded with local criminal gangs

670
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,620
to threaten a victim's family.

671
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,480
Uncle Tianye, let me handle this.

672
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,770
We've dealt with this guy before.

673
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,640
Go find him out.

674
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,400
Got it.

675
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,120
My brother died in this accident.

676
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,610
But those people

677
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,830
forged his death certificate

678
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,750
and forced us to sign off on it.

679
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,160
Okay.

680
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,500
Thank you very much.

681
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,700
Otherwise, he'd beat us up.

682
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,290
I've called the public order office.

683
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,660
The police stations will let us know
if they have any news

684
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,330
about Feng Jiang.

685
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:24,540
Now,

686
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,730
[Name: Feng Jiang]

687
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,170
I can't go home.

688
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,950
Captain Qin.

689
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,150
We've checked with the funeral home
as you instructed.

690
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,280
The death certificate was issued
by Tianyun Hospital,

691
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,850
stating that Feng Hai
died of a sudden heart attack.

692
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,570
But the staff of the funeral home

693
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,180
gave a very different account.

694
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,420
They said the body
showed many external injuries,

695
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,430
as if the victim was killed
by heavy objects.

696
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,140
But they didn't give it too much thought.

697
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,740
Feng Hai's family
signed off on the papers,

698
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,830
and his death certificate was provided,

699
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,760
so the staff had his body cremated.

700
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
Look at this.

701
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,760
I've watched this video many times,

702
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,910
in which Feng Jiang makes an allegation.

703
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,310
His story doesn't sound fabricated at all.

704
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,910
Kill me if you want.

705
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,540
Feng Jiang...

706
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,540
is truly determined.

707
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,110
Suppose Feng Hai

708
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,929
died in the construction accident,

709
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,650
and Tianyun Hospital

710
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,600
forged his death certificate...

711
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,370
Then his family signed off on it.

712
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,790
Tianyun Hospital...

713
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,409
And Hangang Center.

714
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,909
Feng Jiang's report of crimes

715
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,250
would involve a lot of people.

716
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,370
Who could be this powerful?

717
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,889
I think Feng Jiang is in danger now.

718
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,530
We

719
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,460
must find Feng Jiang

720
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,570
before those people do.

721
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,429
Otherwise, we'll lose this lead.

722
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,400
Understood?

723
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,659
-Understood.
-Understood.

724
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,909
It's a very important task.

725
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,870
Take action now.

726
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,469
Let's go!

727
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,320
The weather is so nice today.

728
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,760
Sir.

729
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,420
In fact,

730
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,520
the weather hasn't been good lately.

731
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,530
I sincerely pray to Buddha

732
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,760
for good weather

733
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,550
and unity

734
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,060
in Hanzhou.

735
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,170
Sure.

736
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,650
It's a wish

737
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,010
shared by us all.

738
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,540
At this age, I no longer

739
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,790
seek great achievements.

740
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,250
All I want is to retire with dignity.

741
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,530
How time flies. I've been working
in Hanzhou for so many years.

742
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,820
Now, the voice inside me

743
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,550
is just like what the posts
at construction sites

744
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,430
say,

745
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,670
"safety first."

746
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,250
Sir,

747
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,490
don't worry.

748
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,290
My people are already
looking for Feng Jiang.

749
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,890
He can't hide for long.

750
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,460
Action matters most.

751
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,650
You see,

752
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,590
I just got a tip.

753
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,420
The provincial department

754
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,390
has sent a special task force here.

755
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,950
A special task force?

756
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,020
Yes.

757
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,210
During this critical time,

758
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,860
be careful with your approaches.

759
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,310
Focus on finding Feng Jiang

760
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,860
and fending off the task force
at the same time.

761
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,260
You must figure out the members

762
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,880
of the task force, their movements,

763
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,610
and if they have planted anyone

764
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,400
in the police department.

765
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,950
Well, Sir, look,

766
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,430
as per the standard procedure
within the police system,

767
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,660
special task forces usually operate
in secret.

768
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,950
The first thing they'd do
is an internal investigation.

769
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,690
Don't you think
I'm in too sensitive a position now?

770
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,830
I'm afraid any conspicuous moves I take

771
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,470
might backfire on me.

772
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,480
Shouldn't we lay low and still

773
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,770
at a moment like this?

774
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,290
How's your relationship with Yan?
Pretty good, right?

775
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,220
Yes, we both worked in narcotics before.

776
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,530
But he's a director now,

777
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,080
while you're just a deputy.

778
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,690
When will it be your turn?

779
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,840
Honestly, at your age,

780
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,500
I was already in a leadership role.

781
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,930
It's time you thought about

782
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,980
how much higher
you could climb up the career ladder.

783
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,460
Only those in charge
get to work in the office,

784
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,860
while everyone else
is just a foot soldier.

785
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,750
You do know that clearly

786
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,970
without me telling you, right?

787
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,930
Yes, I do.

788
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
Of course I know that.

789
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,440
A person had better

790
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,460
assess the situation correctly

791
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,430
and keep a clear head.

792
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,760
How old is Yan now?

793
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,060
Isn't he older than you?

794
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,980
You're a competent officer.

795
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,650
In my eyes,

796
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,130
you're better than him.

797
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,830
Why isn't it you
who's being the leader now?

798
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,140
Sir,

799
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,600
allow me

800
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,220
to state my position.

801
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,670
Please rest assured.

802
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,780
I won't be a disappointment

803
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,350
to you.

804
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,190
Good.

805
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,570
Come on, have a seat.

806
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,550
What beautiful scenery.

807
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,700
Such a lovely place.

808
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,420
It's eye-opening.

809
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,130
This mansion belongs to Master Wenxuan,

810
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,530
nephew of Mr. Liu from Tianyun Group.

811
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,840
The point is, you have a really nice car.

812
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,300
Master Wenxuan, care for a speech?

813
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,130
Just address a few words.

814
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,130
Look at this house.

815
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,860
How much area does it cover?

816
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,070
Alright, keep it down.

817
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,750
If my dad's home, we're done for.

818
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,900
Okay. Sure.

819
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,400
Got it. Got it.

820
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,150
Let's go.

821
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,730
Who's there?

822
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,200
What are you doing back there?

823
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,500
Who is it?

824
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,050
What are you doing outside my home?

825
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,380
Where are you going?

826
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,000
Come back here!

827
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,800
Where do you think you're going?

828
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,730
Say something.

829
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,390
Who are you?

830
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,430
You're a thief, huh?

831
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Let me see what you stole.

832
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,800
Come on.

833
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,260
-Take it out!
-Take it out.

834
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,860
I didn't steal!

835
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,960
I'm looking for Zhao Peng.

836
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,290
You're looking for my dad?

837
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,520
Who are you?

838
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,680
Why do you want with him?

839
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,410
Zhao Peng is a real thug.

840
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,180
That construction project of his

841
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,730
caused...

842
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,120
my brother's death.

843
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,450
He's a murderer.

844
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,060
That's nonsense!

845
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,380
Master Wenxuan!

846
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,380
Master Wenxuan!

847
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,080
-Beat him up!
-Let's beat him!

848
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,920
How dare you slander my father, you loser!
