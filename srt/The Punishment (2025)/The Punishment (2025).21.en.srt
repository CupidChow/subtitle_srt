took me into the city,

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Take their money, solve their problems.

190
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Why didn't you just tell me earlier?

191
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,780
I've broken ties with He Biao.

192
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,750
Sooner or later,
he'll force you to take sides.

193
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,150
We don't mind
if you choose to stay neutral.

194
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,550
But as for what's going on in his head,

195
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,480
I wouldn't know.

196
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,510
Wait, if that's the case, this thing

197
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,290
isn't exactly proper.

198
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,630
Is it proper?

199
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Whether it's proper is for others to say;

200
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,080
whether it feels right
is something only you would know.

201
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,670
We're having this meal today

202
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,730
because we truly treat you like a bro.

203
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,660
We wanted to clear the air now

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,150
so you won't find yourself
in an awkward spot later.

205
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,550
Anyway, you already know

206
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,220
how He Gang treats you.

207
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,850
To be frank, we all know

208
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,960
what kind of people those brothers are.

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,760
As for He Biao,

210
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,460
I will definitely go against him.

211
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,320
I hope

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,640
you will stand on my side.

213
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,510
After it's done,

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,880
I won't grab a penny of his money,

215
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,250
and his business will be all yours.

216
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,180
This way, you and your bros

217
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,040
will never worry
about food or clothing again.

218
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,440
Is this proper, Zhao Peng?

219
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,870
Is it, Bro?

220
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,550
Well.

221
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,390
What's the meaning of this?

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,270
Su.

223
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,030
So this is your big bro,

224
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,940
Mr. Bao, right?

225
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,330
Liu Tianye approached you, didn't he?

226
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,840
What terms did he offer?

227
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,360
Su.

228
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,420
Who's your boss?

229
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,980
Who feeds you?

230
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,490
Think about it carefully.

231
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
Your big bro's health isn't good.

232
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,630
If he suddenly drops dead one day,

233
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,160
it has nothing to do with us.

234
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,270
Just try it.

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Do you dare?

236
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,650
That's enough.

237
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,480
Stop this nonsense.

238
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,430
We're here for you to do the work.

239
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,890
Well, Mr. Biao.

240
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,630
If it's about work, let's talk about work.

241
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,960
Is all this necessary? What are you doing?

242
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
Su Hongbao.

243
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,630
I paid you, you do the work.

244
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,810
Seems fair, doesn't it?

245
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,590
But if you're two-faced,

246
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,300
I won't let you off.

247
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,260
Get to the point.

248
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,440
Qiao Defu...

249
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,730
Qiao Defu owes us a lot of money
that he hasn't paid back.

250
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,470
He has a child. Bring him out

251
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,160
and keep him with you for a few days.

252
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,280
It's okay.

253
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,220
It's okay, Bro.

254
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,080
Paying debts

255
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,640
is only right and proper.

256
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,200
I, Su Hongbao,
have gotten where I am today

257
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,470
because of one thing:

258
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
I have standards.

259
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,220
You reap what you sow.

260
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,670
Taking someone's child is crossing a line.

261
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,400
So you're a man with a code, huh?

262
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
When you were driving our cars
and taking our money,

263
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
why didn't you think about
these standards?

264
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,990
Watch how you talk to me.

265
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,840
I drove your car and took your money,

266
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,110
but didn't I work for you?

267
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,100
If I work, shouldn't you pay me?

268
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,670
Su Hongbao.

269
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,970
As long as the work gets done well,

270
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
I don't care how you do it.

271
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,970
I don't care.

272
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,170
Let me remind you of something.

273
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,560
You must take Mai on this job.

274
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,480
If he refuses,

275
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,330
he can't stay with you anymore.

276
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,880
I've made myself clear, right?

277
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,320

with the place.

We'll know our way around soon.

281
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,480
Think carefully about what you should do.

282
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,360
Don't do something like that. Just try it.

283
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
I'm warning you. Just try it.

284

Do you have a reservation?

290
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm looking for He Gang.

291

One moment, please. I'll get Gang.

292

Then we'll consider this matter settled.

376
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,450
Count it.

377
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,490
Boss,

378
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,540
someone's offering us 300,000

379
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,370
to leave.

380
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,590
Whatever they're offering, I'll double it.

381
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,170
Take care of them all for me!

382
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,850
Well, I don't know that person.

383
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,060
I just want to know what you think.

384
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,300
Nothing special.

385
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,130
Leave the money.

386
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,910
It's for your safety.

387
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,570
You can go now.

388
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,320
Wait, wait.

389
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,080
I don't understand.

390
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,040
What do you mean?

391
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,480
Can't you understand?

392
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,540
The 300,000 is

393
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,940
to keep you in one piece.

394
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,830
Is that clear enough?

395
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,070
Is that not clear enough?

396
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,870
Is this the police?

397
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,110
Cops!

398
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,300
Run!

399
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,190
You can't run!

400
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,690
You have to pay for all this damage!

401
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,680
Officer,

402
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,980
you came just in time.

403
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,430
Look,

404
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,350
they fought in my place

405
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,460
and broke all my stuff.

406
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,940
Look. He needs to compensate me.

407
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,290
I'm just running a small business here.

408
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,220
Take it easy.

409
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,890
Don't move!

410
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,110
You need to make this right.

411
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,190
What's going on with Mai?

412
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,290
What exactly is he doing?

413
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,180
Mai just drives every day.

414
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,250
Bullshit!

415
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,250
You think you're the only one
with informants?

416
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,830
I know exactly how many
traffic violations he gets each month.

417
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,960
What happened? Why didn't you tell me?

418
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,500
Director Ye, about these informants...

419
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,410
You have your informants,

420
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,510
but you didn't tell me
about them either, right?

421
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,020
Mai knows what he's doing.
Don't worry about it.

422
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,820
Don't try to dodge the question.

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
What does he know?

424
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,220
Why didn't you stop him?

425
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,940
I tried to stop him,

426
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,640
but he wouldn't listen to me.

427
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,720
I'll go find him.

428
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,820
Director Ye, you find him...

429
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,510
Wait, aren't you

430
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,840
a little overreacting?

431
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,480
We just drank too much that day.

432
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,310
Then,

433
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,110
Su

434
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,270
got into a fight with the next table.

435
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,750
I tried to stop him, but I couldn't.

436
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,610
Drank too much?

437
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
You don't even think before you lie?

438
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm not that useless yet.

439
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,040
What's going on between you
and Su Hongbao?

440
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,310
Nothing. Don't believe me?
Go check yourself.

441
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,710
What good can come
from hanging around him?

442
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,900
Haven't you caused enough trouble already?

443
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,690
What trouble have I caused?

444
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,400
Xu Li's case is still unsolved.

445
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,350
The one who forced
Xiaoyue's death hasn't been found.

446
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,240
If you won't investigate,
what's wrong with me doing it?

447
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,590
How do you know I'm not investigating?

448
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,660
Then, where have you been investigating?

449
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,200
Mentor.

450
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,880
-Let me tell you, Mai Hong Chao!
-Where have you been investigating?

451
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,010
Stop talking!

452
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,590
That's enough.

453
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,070
Mentor.

454
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,750
Don't get angry with him, Mentor.

455
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,920
He drank too much.

456
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,580
His brain isn't working right.
Just ignore him.

457
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,940
Are you trying to start a rebellion, Mai?

458
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,510
What good does it do you t

459
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,040
o piss Mentor off like that?

460
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,240
You really think we're stupid?

461
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,110
Aren't those guys

462
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,530
just Qiao Defu's men?

463
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,910
How did you come up
with that dumb excuse?

464
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,920
Tomorrow,

465
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,770
come with me to gather some intel.

466
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,970
Stop staring at me.

467
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,500
I need to go comfort Mentor.

468
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,780
What a mess this is.

469
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,560
Stop sighing.

470
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,910
You've been upset the whole way.

471
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,410
It's not worth getting upset with Mai.

472
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,940
Don't be upset with him.
That's just how he is.

473
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,770
Don't be upset.

474
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,570
Don't try to smooth things over.

475
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,370
Look, although

476
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,950
Mai can be a bit impulsive

477
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,810
when handling things.

478
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,960
No matter what,

479
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
Mai is still one of our CI agents,

480
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,960
right?

481
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,200
We still need him
for a lot of information.

482
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,030
Besides, Mai is completely
focused on solving cases.

483
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,240
He has no other intentions.

484
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,440
I've seen this kind of behavior before.

485
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,300
When I first became a police officer,

486
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,170
my mentor was just like him.

487
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,970
He just couldn't let things go.

488
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,830
In the end, the case was cracked,
but he was broken.

489
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,560
That's right.

490
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,160
I know you all know what to do.

491
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,560
You know it, and he knows it, too.

492
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,650
But I'm just worried about him.

493
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,130
Mai is a grown man.

494
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,280
What's there to worry about?

495
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,510
Don't worry about it.

496
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,160
Don't worry?

497
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,550
Which one of you three

498
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,080
actually listens to me?

499
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,790
What's the point

500
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,750
of being your mentor anymore?

501
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,680
It's pointless.

502
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,270
Don't say that, Mentor.

503
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,000
We'll listen to you from now on.

504
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,230
There's nothing pointless about it.

505
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,950
Look.

506
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,730
You're in such good health.

507
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,070
You can exercise every morning.

508
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,880
In the morning, you attend meetings
at the bureau.

509
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,440
After meetings,
you spend the afternoon yelling at people.

510
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,270
And after all that yelling, you go home...

511
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,300
Get out of my face!

512
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,930
None of you gives me any peace of mind.

513
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,640
Peace. Peace.

514
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,230
Mentor, don't be upset.

515
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,040
Let's go somewhere to relax.

516
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Take a walk.

517
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,770
What walk? I want to go home.

518
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,510
Home.

519
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,510
Home is good.

520
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,550
It's comfortable there.

521
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,200
You certainly have some unique ideas.

522
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,920
Most people who know
it's my horse Lightning's birthday

523
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,250
would at most send some flowers or plants.

524
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,720
Otherwise,

525
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,310
they use the horse's birthday as an excuse

526
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,440
to give me gifts.

527
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,790
You're the first one to specially

528
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,390
hire an artist for the horse.

529
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,720
To others, Lightning

530
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
might just be a horse.

531
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,520
But I think in your heart,

532
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,830
it represents a deep sentiment.

533
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,340
I want to preserve

534
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,020
this sentiment by your side forever.

535
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,210
Tell me,

536
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,730
what did you want to see me for?

537
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,200
I've come

538
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,590
to apologize.

539
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,020
About the port development,

540
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,760
I acted on my own.

541
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,070
In the next few days,

542
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,170
I'll help you deal with Qiao Defu.

543
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,370
What about Liu Tianye?

544
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,270
I heard

545
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,820
he signed a contract with Qiao Defu.

546
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,620
Liu Tianye is just a nobody

547
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,750
who made some money through smuggling.

548
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,440
This piece of cake

549
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,740
is too big for him to swallow.

550
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,830
You mean

551
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,880
you can handle this cake?

552
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,980
I think

553
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,810
this piece of cake should be ours.

554
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,940
Director Peng from the Municipal Bureau

555
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,510
and I go way back.

556
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,920
I've been cultivating this connection
for a long time.

557
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,220
I think now

558
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,610
it's time to use it.

559
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,410
Regarding Chengjian Group,

560
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,730
I

561
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,500
can leak some information
about them to you.

562
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,290
How you use it

563
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,380
is up to you.

564
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,510
Are you three practicing swimming?

565
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
What's up?

566
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,720
Haven't had enough fighting?

567
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
You want to continue?

568
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,350
No.

569
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,680
I saw you three had good moves last time.

570
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,110
I'd like to earn your friendship.

571
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,800
Look, I brought my buddy here.

572
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Let's get to know each other
and have a chat.

573
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,410
What's there to talk about?

574
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,510
Well, it's fine if you don't want to talk.

575
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,440
But the fight from last time
isn't over yet.

576
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Or maybe I should just pick up the phone

577
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
and call the cops?

578
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,310
Fine.

579
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,190
You got caught

580
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,550
but didn't rat us out.

581
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,080
So, you guys are men with a code.

582
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,180
Indeed.

583
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,230
Looking at your tattoos,

584
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,680
[The pool water is changed, disinfected,
and filtered daily]

585
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,210
you're men with a code, too.

586
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,060
In our world,

587
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,200
the most important things

588
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
are loyalty and righteousness.

589
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,920
And the chivalrous spirit and tender heart

590
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,200
of the brothers and sisters
in the Jianghu.

591
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,550
It's mostly about the mindset.

592
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,410
Only with a good mindset
can you make it in this life.

593
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,400
Alright.

594
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,150
We're all men with a code.

595
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Now we've met each other.

596
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,680
I see you've been staying here
for a few days.

597
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
The bill's on me.

598
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Hurry up with your bath. After that,

599
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,040
I'll take you out for a meal,

600
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,830
okay?

601
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:41,750
[The pool water is changed, disinfected,
and filtered daily]

602
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,480
Sounds good.

603
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,380
I'll wait for you outside.

604
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,240
Come on, stop swimming.

605
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,330
You might choke.

606
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,400
Let's go eat. Come on.

607
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,070
Are we really going?

608
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,130
Let's give it a try.

609
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,480
Come on.

610
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,590
Try this.

611
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,510
Help yourself.

612
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,890
This place of yours

613
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,130
is quite remote.

614
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,790
Remote?

615
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,560
It's a big place we've got here.

616
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,850
Let me tell you, in all of Gutang Town,

617
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,940
no matter who it is,

618
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,630
they all have to come to me
to get things done.

619
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,760
You're so powerful,

620
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
yet you still need us to work for you?

621
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,140
Everyone has something
they'd rather not handle personally.

622
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,130
What do you mean?

623
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,060
Is that a message for us?

624
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,600
I haven't seen you guys before.

625
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,080
Do you have your ID cards?

626
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,830
On what grounds are you checking our IDs?

627
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,030
Routine inspection.

628
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,830
You check IDs
just because you haven't seen us before?

629
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,430
Who gave you that authority?

630
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,590
Just show it when I ask you to.

631
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,750
Stop wasting my time.

632
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,280
What's with your attitude?

633
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,200
Tell me, which law or regulation

634
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
gives you the right

635
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,820
to check my ID?

636
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
Do you have it on you or not?

637
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,000
If not, you'll have to come with me.

638
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,910
Take me.

639
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,460
Take me away right now.

640
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
What's going on, Qin?

641
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,790
You didn't tell me that you're here.

642
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,840
Mai. Mai.

643
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,500
Long time no see.

644
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,710
This is the new guy, right?

645
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,840
New colleague.

646
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,450
When you're out enforcing the law,

647
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,010
you should learn properly.

648
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,070
At the very least, law enforcement
should have should have a human touch.

649
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,790
Don't you know that?

650
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,590
Is this how you talk to citizens?

651
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,080
You've gotten quite good with words now.

652
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,890
Got to learn something, right?

653
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,970
So, these are some new friends of yours?

654
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,510
You wanna sit down and eat something?

655
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,690
I'm on duty.

656
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,440
That's true. Your uniform
isn't really suitable for this.

657
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,700
Alright, I'm leaving.

658
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,380
I heard you're getting promoted?

659
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,990
Your information is quite up-to-date.

660
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,790
You're climbing the ranks
pretty fast, aren't you?

661
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,350
Isn't that thanks to you,

662
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,070
right?

663
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,510
Look, when your new station chief arrives,

664
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,240
Li or whatever his name is,

665
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,880
tell him to come out when needed.

666
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,110
Alright, I'll pass the message.

667
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,820
Okay.

668
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,800
Let's go.

669
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,200
Oh, right,

670
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,110
I almost forgot the important thing.

671
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,070
Why do you always have so much business?
What?

672
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,160
Take my documents back with you.

673
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,880
Okay.

674
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
There are so many people.

675
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,720
Don't make me run back and forth. Take it.

676
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,969
Thank you, Feng.

677
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,850
Alright, I'm leaving.

678
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,920
Take care.

679
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,090
I'm leaving, Mai.

680
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Not bad.

681
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,710
On such friendly terms with the police.

682
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,400
It's nothing.

683
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,980
Your local gang has some power.

684
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,310
[Police]

685
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,670
How was it, Xu?

686
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,219
Did I act well just now?

687
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:41,980
First time?

688
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,260
Yes.

689
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,739
First time, huh?

690
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,900
That's fantastic!

691
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,320
Really amazing! My goodness!

692
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,350
Really?

693
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,630
Thanks.

694
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,880
From now on,

695
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,300
we're friends.

696
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,650
I like that.

697
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Let's be friends.

698
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
Let me tell you, running into Mai

699
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,750
this time

700
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,780
is really fate.

701
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,170
You guys seem like

702
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,820
straightforward people.

703
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,670
Let's get to know each other.

704
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,740
You're pretty straightforward.

705
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,280
I heard recently that

706
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,000
Boss He

707
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,070
got into a fight with Qiao Defu.

708
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,200
You know about that?

709
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,110
Have you guys heard about it?

710
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,920
What are you getting at?

711
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,710
Tell me.

712
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,320
What do I want?

713
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,690
I'm just asking.

714
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,480
These days, more information
means more opportunities.

715
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
Gotta grab what you can when you can.

716
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,780
Neither side

717
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,170
is exactly good people.

718
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,370
Even though we work for Qiao Defu,

719
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,550
I don't think he's got what it takes.

720
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,110
He's no match for He Biao.

721
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,240
He Biao may look refined,

722
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,170
but he's tough and ruthless.

723
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,800
Do you know

724
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,550
what Boss He Biao

725
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,350
used to be called?

726
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,020
What?

727
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,030
Biaozi,

728
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,200
He Biaozi.

729
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,110
Well.

730
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Now he acts all fancy,
drinking tea and stuff,

731
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,740
but he was nothing before.

732
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,510
I still think

733
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,880
that "ice queen" we saw last time
was something else.

734
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,360
She had that ultimate boss-lady vibe—

735
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,900
total Queen energy.

736
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,000
I almost wanted to kneel before her.

737
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,840
Which woman?
Why don't I know about her?

738
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,130
The one with the horse.

739
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,890
What's her name again?

740
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,880
Zhang Xin.

741
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,020
I've looked her up.

742
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,780
That woman,

743
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,060
she's something else.

744
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,070
What does she do?

745
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,590
She must be a big shot too.

746
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,110
But from what I heard from Qiao Defu,

747
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,830
this woman has been

748
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,730
up to no good behind the scenes.

749
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,730
You'd better

750
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,080
stay out of their business.

751
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,920
They're all backed

752
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,720
by big bosses.

753
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,230
That kind of business
isn't for people like us.

754
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,360
Isn't it nice to make some money

755
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,190
and have a few drinks, just like now?

756
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,920
Let me tell you something, bro.

757
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,240
People like us on the street—

758
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,190
who doesn't have a couple of bosses
behind them?

759
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,990
Don't listen to their nonsense.

760
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,960
So, here's the deal.

761
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,850
In the future, if we
have any difficult situations,

762
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,880
I'll come to you.

763
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,040
And if you have any problems,

764
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,660
just let us know,

765
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,550
and we'll be there, too.

766
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,080
Alright?

767
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,000
Okay.

768
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,500
From now on,

769
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,620
we're bros.

770
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,710
It's a deal then.

771
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,110
Cheers.

weren't wasted after all.

At least we got something.

Good.

779
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,860
Right.

Let's take it slow.

781
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,440
Stop at the intersection ahead.

782
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,630
I need to buy cigarettes.

783
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't smoke.

784

Don't buy it.

I'm gonna go grab a pack.

786
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,070
Don't smok.

787
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,810
Give it to me.

You left your lighter there again.

791
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,960
I forgot.

I'm sleepy.

793

Sleepy. Time for bed.

795
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,550
From Su Hongbao.

From Su Hongbao?

798
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,260
How would I know?

799
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,980
There's something wrong with this lighter?

800
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,750
It's my brother's.

How did he end up hanging out with Su?

802
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,800

Something going on?

804
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,740
Does knowing him
ever lead to anything good?

805
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,890
I'm taking this.

you to be so refined.

You have done well this year.

from solving several cases.
