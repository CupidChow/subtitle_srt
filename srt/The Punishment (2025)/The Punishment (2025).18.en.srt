Don't try to protect him.

Get lost!

379
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,910
I can negotiate with He Biao.

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,530
I have a solution.

381
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,570
We don't need to fight,

no one will die,

383
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,800
and no police will be involved.

No fighting, no deaths, no police,

Trust me this once.

I knew it.

You're in this together.

393
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,680
We had a deal.

He'll let you go soon.

395
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,610
I've also talked to your brother.

396
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,160
You had a deal?

397
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,270
I'm the victim here.

00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,030
No way.

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,300
We need to talk now.

I know someone's in there.

Well, I was

What were you talking about?

429
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,590
Su was telling me his past adventures.

430
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,380
They were so exciting and fun

431
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,570
that I was completely captivated.

432
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,480
Is that so?

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,230
You've been staying here
these past two days?

434
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,240
That's right.

00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,570
Is that so, Su Hongbao?

436
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,060
He's been here.

437
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,700
What happened to his face?

438
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,070
You've got excessive internal heat, right?

439
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,030
Really?

440
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,750
The air's so dry.
I scratched and broke the skin.

441
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,010
So much heat in your body, huh?

442
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,810
The weather is too dry.

443
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,420
Su Hongbao, didn't you set off fireworks

444
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,620
to cool him down a bit?

445
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,450
What are you talking about?

446
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,070
Are you referring to
what happened at my store?

447
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,880
Did you investigate it?

448
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,180
Well, some of my guys

449
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,790
bought some cheap fireworks.

450
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,640
We were planning to save them
for the New Year celebration.

451
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,680
We never expected
they would somehow catch fire.

452
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,540
That works too.

453
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,520
Consider it an early celebration.

454
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,620
It was your men who set them off?

455
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,910
I see.

456
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,310
I guess you've had a good conversation

457
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,570
and sorted things out.

458
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,730

at the police station now.

567
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,660
Lately,

568
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,310
the police have been watching us closely.

569
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,620
If we continue fighting,

570
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,950
we won't make any money,

571
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,890
and we might end up in jail.

572
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
I think it's really

573
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,190
not worth it.

574
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,160
I think

575
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Tianye is right.

576
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,280
After all, Su let my brother go,

577
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
and he came here

578
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,820
to have a meal and drink with us.

579
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,170
So, nothing is off the table.

580
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,110
I know exactly

581
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,460
what you want.

582
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,230
You just want to

583
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,070
take care of your old brothers, right?

584
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,070
I'm the same.

585
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,290
I have a brother too.

586
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,180
A man should always
look out for his brothers.

587
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,160
Unlike Ma Jin,

588
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,000
I hold nothing back from my brothers.

589
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,640
But first,

590
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,090
you need to see me
as your brother, right?

591
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,140
After having this drink,

592
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,080
let's forget about the past.

593
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,510
We'll keep in touch from now on. Cheers!

594
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,410
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

595
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,720
Gang,

596
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
raise your glass.

597
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,270
Raise your glass!

598
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,240
By the way,

599
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,200
Su.

600
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,480
I've

601
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,710
prepared a pawnshop for you.

602
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,440
From now on, you'll be fully in charge of

603
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,170
the debt collection business.

604
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,350
Whatever you say.

605
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,370
This is my own car.

606
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,390
It's yours now.

607
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,140
Later, I'll also

608
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,830
assign some men to assist you.

609
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,110
Why are you staring at me?

610
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,510
Aren't your eyes tired?

611
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,100
How about this?

612
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,510
Come on.

613
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
Are you happy now?

614
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,590
I've paid you back for that punch.

615
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,720
If that's not enough, I'll do it again.

616
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,750
As your brother said, we're family now.

617
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,920
So, this is over.

618
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,440
Can you let it go?

619
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,530
Alright.

620
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,720
Come on.

621
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,310
Let's drink up.

622
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,490
Tianye, drink up.

623
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,770
Cheers. Cheers.

624
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,880
Good.

625
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,510
Eat meat

626
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,300
and drink wine.

627
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,990
Today's matter is now

628
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,530
water under the bridge.

629
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,880
Let's move on. Come on.

630
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,590
Come on, brothers,

631
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,190
let's have a drink together.

632
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,440
Muzhi,

633
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,320
do you really trust Su Hongbao?

634
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,400
Are you really going to use him?

635
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm wondering

636
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,910
why Liu Tianye

637
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
tried so hard to persuade Su Hongbao

638
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,790
to join us.

639
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,770
Why would he do that?

640
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,750
I'm the one asking.

641
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,760
I'm full and sleepy.

642
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,390
I can't protect you forever.

643
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,250
If one day I'm gone,

644
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,720
what will you do?

645
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,570
Muzhi!

646
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,550
You're still here, aren't you?

647
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,270
Just be honest with me.

648
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,600
What exactly is he up to?

649
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,030
Look.

650
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,270
Su Hongbao

651
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,060
is like a knife.

652
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,490
No matter who's holding it,

653
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
it's just a knife.

654
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,280
But Liu Tianye is different.

655
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,400
Liu Tianye is just like us.

656
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,110
He's got great ambition.

657
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,020
He's obsessed with
getting a seat at the table.

658
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,080
A seat at the table?

659
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,250
Whose table?

660
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,090
He wants to cooperate with Zhang Xin.

661
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,300
Is he even capable of that?

662
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,630
Listen, remember this.

663
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,440
Liu Tianye

664
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,429
killed Ma Jin.

665
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,679
Ma Jin fell at his hands,

666
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,130
and we didn't help much, right?

667
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,810
Yes.

668
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,679
So, keep this in mind.

669
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,790
We must be

670
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,949
careful around Liu Tianye.

671
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,820
We can't become the next Ma Jin.

672
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,280
Got it?

673
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,440
Got it.

674
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,679
Tianye, goodbye.

675
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,610
Thanks.

676
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,030
Tianye.

677
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,030
How did it go with

678
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,290
He Biao and Su Hongbao?

679
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,830
We don't have much time left.

680
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,940
Contact Uncle Limin and Chen Shuifa.

681
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,420
I need to talk to Qiao Defu.

682
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,840
Why do you want to see him?

683
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,480
What does he have to do with us?

684
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,740
Now I need to build a connection with him.

685
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,800
He won the bid

686
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,090
for Hangang Center.

687
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,310
Even Zhang Xin is out.

688
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,290
Is Zhang Xin okay with that?

689
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,760
Of course not.

690
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,920
That's why

691
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,480
this is our best opportunity.

692
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,070
Do you mean

693
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,600
we should use
Qiao Defu's business at the port

694
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,030
to persuade Zhang Xin
to negotiate with the higher-ups?

695
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,990
Once I cooperate with Qiao Defu,

696
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,830
I'll have a seat at the table.

697
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,440
And if we can get

698
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,170
some shares in Hangang Center,

699
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,090
we'll have the stature
to negotiate with anyone.

700
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,750
Will they even consider us?

701
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,760
That's why we need to expand our business.

702
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,230
Refined oil products are currently

703
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,230
the most profitable.

704
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,290
Like I said before,

705
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,280
we can buy some gas stations

706
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,680
to create a supply chain.

707
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,150
We also need to speed up
the money laundering.

708
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,880
The other day, I saw

709
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,610
a seafood restaurant for sale.

710
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,000
It has high prices and big cash flows.

711
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,330
I'll talk to them later.

712
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,730
Tianye.

713
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,030
This is pure gambling.

714
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,330
What if we lose?

715
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,070
Do you have a backup plan?

716
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,090
Anyway, I've already risked everything.

717
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,110
Lose?

718
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,810
If we lose,

719
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
we'll start over.

720
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,630
If we lose,

721
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,470
we'll never get another chance.

722
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,330
For this shipment,

723
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,490
I've left you a backup plan.

724
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,030
The bullets will come
with the next shipment.

725
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,710
Tianye,

726
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,220
this is a real gun.

727
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,000
This...

728
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,530
This is awesome.

729
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,920
With this,

730
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
nobody will dare mess with us anymore!

731
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,670
Right?

732
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,190
Tianye.

733
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,000
You need to think carefully
about how to use it.

734
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you.

735
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
I hope you never have to use it.

736
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,670
Did you drink?

737
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,880
I drank with my clients.

738
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,670
Don't let him smell it!

739
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,920
Tell me.

740
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,560
Who were you drinking with?

741
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,590
Just some clients

742
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,840
and friends.

743
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,320
Who was that person today?

744
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,840
Which one?

745
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,440
Which one? The one who dropped the hammer.

746
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,590
Just a supplier.

747
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,570
What kind of supplier
carries those things around?

748
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,420
He can't be a good guy.

749
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,230
That guy...

750
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,640
just got out of jail.

751
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,150
Just got out?

752
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,630
Wait,

753
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,760
Liu Tianye, are you out of your mind?

754
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,510
Why would you associate
with someone like that?

755
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,920
Well,

756
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,400
when

757
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,150

758
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,630
you meet all sorts of people.

759
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,430
But he's really not a bad person.

760
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Not bad in nature.

761
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,150

762
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,030

763

I'm back unharmed.

764
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,090
Don't worry.

765
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,540
If he were a bad guy,

766
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,150
would I be able to come back like this?

767
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,670
I wouldn't.

768
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,800
I was so worried.

769
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,280

he's very ambitious.

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,240
He wants a seat at the table
just like He Biao does.

812
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,550
