Don't worry.

753
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,440
Focus

754
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,990
on your current work first.

755
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,970
Trust the organization.

756
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,210
Regarding this matter,

757
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,610
we still need to discuss

758
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
with Director Ye.

759
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,110
Let me see.

760
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Who is the author?

761
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,610
Where did it come from?

762
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,000
Down there.

763
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,350
Wen Bo,

764
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,440
is there anything you want to tell us?

765
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,860
Do you think if you say nothing,

766
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,390
we won't be able to find out?

767
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,070
One of your mother's bank accounts

768
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,600
has a deposit
totaling over 5.4 million yuan.

769
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,310
We have already verified it.

770
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,890
Such a large sum of money—

771
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,840
all these years,

772
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
your mother never mentioned it to you?

773
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,180
I don't know.

774
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,570
I haven't touched a penny of it.

775
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,430
Wen Bo,

776
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,250
based on what we've learned,

777
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,760
your family's dividends from the village

778
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
can never amount to such a large sum.

779
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,450
So we hope you can

780
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,440
think carefully

781
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,580
and answer our questions truthfully.

782
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,510
What am I supposed to think?

783
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,170
I really don't know anything.

784
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,000
Don't rush.

785
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,890
Take your time.

786
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,380
We will verify everything one by one.

787
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,020
Next, we will ask you a few questions.

788
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,750
During your case handling,

789
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,190
were you involved
in any cases concerning Longwan?

790
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,190
Did you ever leak case information?

791
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,390
Or

792
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,190
in situations
where you should have recused yourself,

793
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,700
did you fail to do so?

794
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,290
No.

795
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,590
None of that.

796
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,020
The only one involving recusal

797
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,410
was Qiao Defu's case.

798
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,080
But that was handled by the ECID.

799
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,940
I've never covered for anyone.

800
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:35,440
[Qunhuan Trading Co., Ltd.]

801
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,570
This is the last one.

802
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,370
Once we get it, we'll have everything.

803
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,570
Leave this one alone.

804
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,630
Why?

805
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,770
This one is different.

806
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,740
They're not just involved
in money laundering.

807
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,670
A lot of goods come in through here.

808
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,190
You mean...

809
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,590
smuggling?

810
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,170
This company has no connection to Longwan
on the surface.

811
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,900
Even if they get caught,
there's nothing to fear.

812
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,110
This is your family matter.

813
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,700
I still think...

814
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,880
it would be better to tell your brother.

815
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,940
No need to tell him.

816
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,400
If we tell him,
we won't be able to catch them.

817
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,030
Wait,

818
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,190
Jiangyan,

819
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,460
what exactly are you trying to do?

820
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,490
I want to stop all of this.
