00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,670
so you owe me.

191
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,410
So today you

192
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,270
must tell me...

193
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,150
You still remember I owe you?

194
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,390
...who that person is.

195
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,250
You owe me.

196
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,550
It's because...

197
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
It's because I owe you,

198
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,230
even if I know...

199
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,560
I still...

200
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,830
I still don't know.

201
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,270
Let me owe you for now.

202
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,120
I don't know.

203
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,200
That means you know.

204
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,470
You have to tell me who that person is.

205
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,840
No, you don't need to...

206
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
You don't need to
try to trick me into talking.

207
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
-I really don't know.
-Who's tricking you?

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
I don't know.

209
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,770
I'm begging you.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,240
Tell me who that person is.

211
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,300
Who is that person?

212
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Who is that person?

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
You...

214
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,310
You're not a cop anymore.

215
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,750
You're not a cop anymore.

216
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,630
Are you a cop? You're just a driver.

217
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,630
Are you a cop?

218
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,880
So what if I drive?

219
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,640
What about it?

220
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,470
You believe it or not—

221
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,870
I'll floor it and run them over.

222
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,120
Go on, hit them. Hit them.

223
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,670
Hit them. Hit them. Hit them.

224
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,080
After you hit them, what...

225
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,480
After you hit them,
what are you going to do?

226
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,870
After you hit them,
what are you going to do?

227
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,000
I won't do anything.

228
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll kill them.

229
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,270
You've lost it. You've really lost it.

230
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,720
You've gone crazy, don't you know that?

231
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,790
Yeah, I've lost it.

232
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,070
I don't know.

233
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,240
I don't know.

234
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,260
I just don't know.

235
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll ask you one last time.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
I don't know!

237
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't know.

238
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,720
Don't ask me.

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,670
I don't know. Go to sleep right away.

240
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,480
Go to sleep.

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,440
I don't know.

242
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not that I won't say—
I really don't know.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,130
I really don't know.

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,850
Get lost.

245
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,050
Get the hell out.

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,870
Get lost.

247
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,120
Get lost!

248
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,040
Get lost!

249
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,670
Get lost already!

250
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Get lost far away.

251
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,010
Get lost!

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Get as far away as you can!

253
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,550
Get lost!

254
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,480
Get the hell out.

255
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
Mai.

256
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:23,960
Mai.

257
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,900
What are you doing?

258
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,930
I've called you so many times.

259
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,230
If you're not answering,
why even have a phone?

260
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,930
What are you doing?

261
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,490
Where's Su Hongbao?

262
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,510
I chased him away.

263
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,730
Why did it turn into a fight?

264
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
He had it coming.

265
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,600
Did you get anything out of him?

266
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,150
He didn't say a word.

267
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,650
Alright.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
Don't stay out here.

269
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Go inside and lie down for a bit.

270
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,270
Grab something to eat.

271
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,070
Get up. Get up.

272
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,510
I was half-asleep just now
and dreamed about Xiaoyue.

273
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,700
In the dream, he was talking to me,
but I couldn't hear clearly.

274
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,360
It's been a year.

275
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,670
Crazy.

276
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,470
A whole year, and we've gotten nowhere.

277
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,390
Xiaoyue.

278
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,670
Xu Li.

279
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,510
It's been 10 years.

280
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,600
I just don't get it.

281
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,080
Why is this stupid thing so hard?

282
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,910
Don't we have to take it step by step?

283
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,770
What's wrong with you?

284
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,750
You've made it through all these years.

285
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,810
Why can't you hold it together today?

286
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,910
Crazy.

287
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
You have to keep going.

288
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,420
Investigate them.

289
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,240
Get to the bottom of all of it.

290
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,270
I've hit my limit.

291
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,070
This is all my life's going to be.

292
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,750
You have to hang in there too.

293
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,000
Mai.

294
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,790
Out of all of us, you're the toughest.

295
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,470
Don't talk like that.

296
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,670
What's there that can't be gotten through?

297
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,400
As long as they're still human,

298
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,880
sooner or later they'll all be caught.

299
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,510
It's so dark right now—

300
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,650
can it still get bright?

301
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Pull the curtains open, and it will.

302
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,290
I'll get you something to eat.

303
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,240
Why don't you talk it over

304
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,430
with Mr. He again,
and run the numbers again?

305
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,030
I think you're

306
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,200
not giving them a choice.

307
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
You're not giving them a choice.

308
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,570
Alright, alright.

309
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,410
Let's leave it at that for now.

310
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,030
Quite the upgrade, huh.

311
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,690
This place of yours isn't bad.

312
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
Didn't you go out driving today?

313
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,900
The car broke down.

314
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,600
Broke down?

315
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,030
Karma, huh.

316
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,320
That's what you get for being heartless.

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
I was talking to you nicely,

318
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,000
but you whip me with a shoe sole.

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,730
So this is karma. You get it now?

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,550
Well.

321
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,010
Why are you looking for me? Say it.

322
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,910
My car broke down, didn’t it?

323
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,090
Nothing to do.

324
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,380
Just seeing if you've got any work for me.

325
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,090
You whip me
with a shoe sole one minute,

326
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,000
then turn around
and ask me for a job the next.

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,750
You really don't treat yourself
like an outsider.

328
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,010
You don't know
what kind of work I do here?

329
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,200
I do.

330
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,770
You work for He Biao, right?

331
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,480
Mai,

332
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,250
don't think I don’t know...

333
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Why you're getting so close to me.

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,030
Isn't it just

335
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,500
to get close to He Biao,

336
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,440
then figure out who's backing him?

337
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
That's it, right?

338
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,440
I'll tell you this—
I'm fine dealing with you,

339
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,200
but my brothers here

340
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
have families to support, mouths to feed.

341
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,710
If you stick with me,

342
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
how am I supposed to do business?

343
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
Well, first get one thing straight.

344
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm not a cop anymore.

345
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,620
I'm not the same as those guys.

346
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,150
I just want to find some work here,

347
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,790
and maybe ask who that person is.

348
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,400
Alright, alright, alright.

349
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,630
Alright, alright, alright.

350
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,650
Lower your voice.

351
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,860
You think I don't know what you're after?

352
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,590
It's hot.

353
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,360
I remember you telling me before—

354
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,290
what kind of car did you like again?

355
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,120
A G-Wagon.

356
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,750
Not bad.
Making me driving for you?

357
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,720
What's wrong with driving for me?

358
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,530
Deal or not?

359
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,590
Thanks, boss.

360
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,870
I told you already—think it over again.

361
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,550
You're being a bit too out of line,
you know that?

362
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,010
No one else can do this job.

363
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
No, it's not that.

364
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,200
Well—

365
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,160
Mr. He said

366
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,240
there's a guy surnamed Zhou
who owes us gambling debts.

367
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,900
He used his car as collateral.

368
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,490
You guys go get the car back.

369
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,440
In a bit, I'll send you

370
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,780
all the details.

371
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:11,869
Alright then.

372
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,740
Okay. Alright.

373
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,020
Send it over later.

374
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,520
I'll get you a change of clothes.

375
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,069
Sure, as long as you pay.

376
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,069
I'm broke anyway.

377
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,790
Enough about money.

378
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,300
This is a pawnshop—

379
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,260
we lack everything except money.

380
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,720
Have some tea.

381
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,580
We'll go handle something later.

382
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,290
Alright.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
This is someone else's turf.

384
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
Be polite.

385
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
We need to take
the moral high ground first.

386
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Guys,

387
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,870
which one of you is Mr. Zhou?

388
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,040
That's me.

389
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,320
What is it? Who are you guys?

390
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,650
His surname's Su.

391
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,240
By the rules of the underworld,

392
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,110
you should call him Mr. Bao.

393
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,750
Su Hongbao.

394
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,480
What do you want?

395
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,840
Mr. Zhou, here's the thing—

396
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,030
do you owe Mr. He some money?

397
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,510
How about this—

398
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,680
why don't you give him a call,

399
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,270
and you two talk it out again?

400
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,600
Otherwise, just do what you promised him.

401
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,880
Hand me the car keys.

402
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,830
I'll drive the car away and that's it.

403
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,360
You've come all the way here
to collect a debt?

404
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,030
Money lost at the gambling table
should be settled at the gambling table.

405
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,110
And if you want the money,

406
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,870
have your boss come himself.

407
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,880
What are you two supposed to be, anyway?

408
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,410
Get lost.

409
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,210
Mr. Zhou, this was all agreed already.

410
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,510
Don't go back on your word.

411
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,300
That wouldn't be very decent.

412
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,980
Right?

413
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Well.

414
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,660
What was it—"Mr. Bao," right?

415
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
What did you just say?

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,260
You said I'm not being decent, is that it?

417
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,420
Decent enough for you now?

418
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,080
Get lost!

419
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,690
I'd like to report an incident.

420
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,000
People from Chenjiang Sand & Gravel Plant
hit us.

421
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,570
Alright, please come over right away.

422
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,680
If we fight back,
that counts as self-defense, right?

423
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,020
It already does.

424
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,130
Hello, is this Captain Qin?

425
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,170
Who's that?

426
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,000
We're from the Gaoxin Police Station.

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,350
Your senior is with us.

428
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,640
Who's with you?

429
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,070
Your senior, Mai Hongchao.

430
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,550
He got into a fight and he's here with us.

431
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,480
Please come over as soon as you can.

432
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,630
Okay, thanks.

433
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,400
Got it.

[Gaoxin Police Station]

435
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,290
Sit. Sit.

436
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,710
Su.

437
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,270
You've been around the block.

438
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,210
I won't say much.

439
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,510
You did all those years inside.

440
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,640
Now that you're out,

441
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,550
you can't go back
to fighting and killing, right?

442
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,950
You can't walk
the old road anymore, right?

443
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,970
You've even put on a suit now.

444
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,930
Stop doing that kind of thing.

445
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,960
Yes. Yes. Yes.

446
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,880
If you really can't hold it in

447
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,070
and just want to go after someone,

448
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,170
go do it yourself.

449
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,880
Don't drag Mai into it.

450
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,210
Mai isn't your shield.

451
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
Do you understand?

452
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,240
Well, Captain Qin,

453
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,500
you've really misunderstood me on this.

454
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,210
Ask him—who's...

455
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,810
Been sticking to whom?

456
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,040
Ask your buddy.

457
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,280
If there's nothing else,

458
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,000
then

459
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,450
I'll be leaving.

460
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,550
I'll go with you.

461
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,080
Let's go.

[Gaoxin Police Station]

463
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,030
See you, Captain Qin.

464
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Let me have a word with you, alright?

465
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,330
Just a couple of words.

466
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,240
Then like this, Mai—

467
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,400
you two chat for a bit.

468
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't forget to drive my car back for me.

469
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,750
Fill up the tank.

470
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,950
I'm off, Captain Qin.

471
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,320
Go ahead.

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,640

473
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,360
what the heck are you doing?

474
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,270
I really never expected you
to cling to him like this.

475
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,400
You used to be a cop.

476
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,090
You spent so many years as a CI.

477
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,730
And now you're working
for the other side now?

478
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,790
Running with the underworld?

479
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,050
What are you thinking?

480
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

481
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,330
What I should've been doing back then,

482
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm doing now.

483
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,430
Let me ask you something.

484
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,830
Do you know why, for all these years,

485
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,750
we've never been
able to beat those people?

486
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,690
You tell me.

487
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,830
It's because we were too by-the-book.

488
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,270
I'm not a cop anymore.

489
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,000
I wanted to be a one,
but I can't anymore.

490
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
To get to the truth,

491
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,720
I need my own methods, right?

492
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,550
From now on,
I don't care about anything else.

493
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,310
I'm going to stick to
Su Hongbao like glue.

494
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,640
I don't believe

495
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,700
I can't squeeze something out of him.

496
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,480
This case has haunted me for half my life.

497
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,340
I'm not young anymore—I can't wait.

498
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
Stop trying to control me, alright?

499
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,590
You can't wait anymore,
so this is what you choose to do?

500

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,880
Who isn't investigating this?

502
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,590
By your logic,

503
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,590
you've gone back
to being a spy, huh?

504
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,070
Use your brain for a second.

505
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,590
Do you think they'd actually trust you?

506
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,480
What did you used to do—

507
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,280
do you really not know yourself?

508
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,750
Let me put it this way.

509
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,830
Even if you're working undercover,

510
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,070
even if you're already a spy,

511
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,070
shouldn't you have a handler
inside the police force?

512
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,510
Who are you reporting to?

513
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,780
You're just freelancing as a spy?

514
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,110
Mai,

515
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,830
I'm not trying to lecture you,

516
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,110
but if any one of those guys earlier
had even a minor injury,

517
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,640
you'd be going back inside.

518
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,730
What undercover work then?

519
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,600
I blink for a second

520
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,480
and something like this blows up.

521
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
Between us brothers,
I won't say much else.

522
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,310
You have your own road.

523
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,300
You have your ideas, your methods.

524
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,660
No one's stopping you.

525
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,480
But shouldn't you at least tell me?

526
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,070
You should let me know, right?

527
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,470
It's only been a few days,

528
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,310
and you're already
fighting people with Su Hongbao.

00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,370
Alright, alright.

530
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,640
Enough nagging.

531
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,370
I'm not talking nonsense, Mai.

532
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,110
I'm not just babbling at you.

533
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,810
I'm formally telling you this now.

534
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,790
Investigate.

535
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,510
Dig.

536
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,270
If you can't wait,

537
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,200
fine.

538
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,550
No matter how much you dig up,

539
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,720
in the end don't you still have to
come back
to the proper path?

540
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,880
Don't you still have
to go through the procedure,

541
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,430
Mai?

542
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,000
Otherwise what can you even do
if you find something?

543
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
Kill someone?

544
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,680
I'm telling you all this

545
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,590
because I don't want one day—

546
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,720
-I won't even know where to find you, Mai.
-Will you stop?

547
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
Enough or not?

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,010
If you want to ask something, just ask.

549
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,640
Alright.

550
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,690
You've been sticking close
for quite a while now.

551
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,660
Any news come out of it?

552
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,070
Not much.

553
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,970
Just one thing.

554
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,640
Look at you.

555
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,510
Can't you talk things out
without resorting to violence?

556
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,910
By the way,

557
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,320
Mr. He asked

558
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,830
why Qiao Defu hasn't
been going to play lately.

559
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,200
I don't know.

560
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,050
Probably busy with work.

561
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,070
Then invite him more often.

562
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,200
The more he goes,

563
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,880
the less you owe, right?

564
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,850
You get it?

565
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,830
Mr. He asked me to pass that on to you.

566
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,690
I've told you—do you understand?

567
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,550
I understand.

568
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,270
I understand, Mr. Bao.

569
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,070
I understand.

570
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,480
He Biao's target

571
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,680
isn't that Mr. Zhou.

572
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,920
It's Qiao Defu.

573
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Chengjian Group?

574
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,070
Always in the news.

575
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,310
Just won another bid, didn't they?

576
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,350
How did those two get connected?

577
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
That I don't know.

578
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,560
All I know is Su Hongbao

579
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,960
asked him to take Qiao Defu
onto that boat more often.

580
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:13,370
That's all I know.

581
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,430
Chengjian Group...

582
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,310
He Biao can't handle

583
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,250
the port project on his own.

584
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,420
Who he's working with?

585
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,790
That's your business.

586
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,000
Not mine.

587
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,350
But I'll remind you of one thing.

588
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm sure

589
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,280
there's definitely someone backing them.

590
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,910
And that backer

591
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,520
is the person we're looking for.

592
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,730
I'm leaving.

593
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,410
Mai.

594
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800
Mess around all you want,

595
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,390
but don't cross the bottom line.

An officer surnamed Qin said
he had an appointment with you.

602

I didn't make an appointment with him.

I've heard a lot about you.

611
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,110
You flatter me.

612
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,310
It's all just part of the job.

613
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,240
Come, have some tea. Have some tea.

614
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,790
Alright.

00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,130

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,460
What brings you

618
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,300

619
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,390

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,610

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,730
take a look.

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,440
Mr. Qiao,

634
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,790
is it fun going out on that boat usually?

635
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,550
It's fun.

636
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,590
Even the most law-abiding citizen,

637
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,750
when talking to the police,

638
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,400
gets a little nervous.

639
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,750
What—what's fun about it?

640
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,160
What kind of boat are you talking about?

641
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,200
Nothing, I just heard
you often go out to sea.

642
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,930
Just asking.

643
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,340

are pretty familiar, right?

648
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,970
Not really.

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,580
He Biao. You don't know him?

650
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,410
Captain Qin,

651
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,720
did you come today to drink tea,

652
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,120
or to investigate a case?

653
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,400
I'm here for publicity.

654
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,640
If it were an investigation,

655
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,500
we'd be back at our station
having tea, wouldn't we?

656
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,480
Look—

657
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,170

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,440

No problem.

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,930
You go ahead.

with the boat.

666
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,680
Alright, I'll be going then.

667
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Sure, sure.

668
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,790
Qiao Defu?

669
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,350
Where did you get this information?

670
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,210
Is it reliable?

671
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,070
Reliable.

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,460
He Biao

673
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,510
doesn't have that kind of appetite.

674
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,480
Qiao Defu is a business owner.

675
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,960
Even if Qiao handed him those projects,

676
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
he couldn't handle them.

677
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,390
So I think He Biao

678
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,270
is just a gun.

679
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,150
But who's holding the gun?

680
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,970
That's what we need to find out.

681
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,770
The mastermind behind him?

682
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,440
Qiao Defu's Chengjian Group

683
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,200
just secured

684
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
a key project
in the port development zone.

685
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,760
That's a real hot commodity.

686
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,510
A lot of people have their eyes on it.

687
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,040
Exactly.

688
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,270
So that's why I'm saying
we start by investigating—

689
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,600
check who

690
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,650
has designs on Qiao Defu's project.

691
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,510
First narrow down

692
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,400
the scope,

693
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,410
then break through one by one.

694
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,810
And also, Director Ye,

695
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,510
he's been getting
very close to He Biao lately.

696
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,960
Whenever he's free,
He Biao takes him out on the boat.

697
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,360
It's probably gambling.

698
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
I've already sent people
from the team over.

699
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Let's make a grab.

700
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,880
Qiao Defu is a sensitive figure

701
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,400
in Hanzhou.

702
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,740
I'm afraid it won't go that smoothly.

703
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,310
I'm not going to arrest him.

704
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,160
I'm just doing
a routine gambling bust, right?

705
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,590
If he gets caught,
then that's just how it is.

706
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,120
Isn't it?

707
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,950
And if he does get caught,

708
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,960
we dig deeper.

709
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,680
If we don't catch him...

710
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,260
If we don't,

711
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,110
then we think of another way.

712
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,960
I'll also go to the city government
and help you ask around

713
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
about the port development zone.

714
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,010
Alright.

715
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,160
Okay.

716
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,450
How's Mai been lately?

717
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,640
Lately, Mai is...

718
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,790
Still just driving.

719
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,280
He hasn't been acting up, right?

720
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,460
Just driving. What could he be up to?

721
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,160
Mr. He, if there's something, just say it.

722
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,370
Why did you bring Mai
into yesterday's thing?

723
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,270
His car broke down. He had no work.

724
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,390
He wanted to earn some money with me.

725
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,170
You'll take in just anyone?

726
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,460
You don't know what
his relationship with Qin Feng is?

727
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,920
I know.

728
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,600
If you want to die,
don't drag us down with you.

729
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,370
Mai has done me a favor.

730
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,920
He came to me for help.

731
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,180
I couldn't just stand by and not help him.

732
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,620
But don't worry.

733
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,530
I know this guy well.

734
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,200
I won't say a word

735
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,480
I shouldn't say to him.

736
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,000
And besides,

737
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,830
he's efficient at work.

738
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,290
It's convenient taking him along anywhere.

739
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,940
You talk a good game.

740
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,640
If something goes wrong, can you carry it?

741
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,590
Gang.

742
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,780
Watch how you talk.

743
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
We invited Hongbao here
to get things done.

744
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,530
As long as the job gets done,

745
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,280
the rest doesn't concern us.

746
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,230
I'm telling you, bro,
the way you talk...

747
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,980
You really need

748
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,480
to watch it.

749
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,770
I'm already talking to you properly.

750
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,750
Biao.

751
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,970
You're really that confident in him?

752
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,310
Tianye.

753
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
What do you think?

754
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,850
Trust those you use.

755
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,730
Don't use those you doubt.

756
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,270
A few friends
want to top up and get cards.

757
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,110
Two hundred thousand each.

758
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,170
Handle it for them.

759
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,110
Issue five cards first.

760
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,590
Madam.

761
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,620
These people

762
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,580
top up but don't really come much.

763
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,160
They've got money to burn.
That's none of our business.

764
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,030
Hurry up and take care of it.

765
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,720
Tomorrow have finance
deposit the money in the bank.

766
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,680
You can get off work.

767
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,210
Alright.

768
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,480
Ms. Zhou.

769
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,160
Ms. Zhou.

770
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,100
I come here four times a week.

771
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,030
Can't I just charge it?

772
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,640
Dr. Chen.

773
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,790
You know how it is—

774
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,590
here,

775
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,510
only VIP clients

776
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,110
can charge it to their account.

777
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,840
Do me a favor.

778
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,440
Well...

779
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,030
Wait a moment.

780
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,590
Liu.

781
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,840
Please. This way.

782
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,270
He can't pay the bill.

783
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,150
How much can one person even eat?

784
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,550
It's not really the food.

785
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,280
He lost several hundred thousand
playing cards.

786
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,880
Who is he?

787
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,960
He used to be
the head of thoracic surgery
at City Second Hospital.

788
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,070
Later he was arrested
in an anti-gambling sweep

789
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,730
and got fired by the hospital.

790
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,790
Where was he playing?

791
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,120
I heard he often goes to He Biao's place.

792
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,480
Dr. Chen.

793
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,290
Pleasure meeting you.

794
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,920
We've met before at the card table.

795
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
You probably don't remember.

796
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,760
I paid that bill for you just now.

797
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,550
Let's call it making a friend.

798
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,810
Then thank you very much.

799
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,280
No problem.

800
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,139
You paid for it?

801
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,590
I'll pay you back.

802
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,480
It's fine. Let's exchange contact info.

803
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
We can play cards together sometime.

804
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,800
Sure, sure.

805
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,370
So, well...

806
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,280
You paid for it?

807
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,440
It's over. All good now.

808
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,550
Then I'll...

809
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,840
Alright, alright, stay in touch,
come by and hang out.

810
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,110
Safe travels, Dr. Chen.

811
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,800
Come often.

812
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
You're just letting him go like that?

813
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,440
What about the gambling debt he owes?

814
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,700
He'll come back again.

815
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,480
Uncle Limin is here.

816
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,940
Director Chen is here too.

817
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,230
Today is really a happy day.

818
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,590
Thank you, Director Chen, for giving us
the chance to host you for a meal.

819
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,360
We've been waiting
for this day for a long time.

820
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,070
Exactly.

821
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
Mr. Liu, you're too kind.

822
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,590
Well...

823
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,760
Section Chief Qin has worked
for me for over a year now,

824
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,000
and you're relatives as well.

825
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,530
We're practically family.

826
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,030
It's really thanks to
Director Chen's leadership.

827
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,800
Otherwise how could I be working

828
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,660
so smoothly in the development zone?

829
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,190
Right?

830
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,440
Earlier on, Longwan did have

831
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,360
some issues,

832
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,840
caused you quite a bit of trouble.

833
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,100
I felt bad about it too.

834
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,230
But looking ahead, I also hope
we can stay in close contact.

835
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,800
So...

836
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,030
I'll drink

837
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,760
this pot as a penalty on myself.

838
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,770
You see,

839
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,360
what's past is past.

840
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,730
Let's turn the page on old matters.

841
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,360
Yes.

842
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,150
Come on.

843
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,870
Thank you, Director.

844
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
Today, I...

845
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
I'll toast you first.

846
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,520
Come on.

847
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,230
May everything go smoothly.

848
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,160
-Thanks.
-Okay.

849
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,840
Today,

850
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,570
I specially brought some of our

851
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,930
Longwan specialties.

852
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,110
Longwan chicken.

853
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,570
You really must

854
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,380
try it.

855
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,710
It's

856
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,960
the freshest.

857
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,320
I've long heard
that Longwan chicken is famous.

858
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,450
Never had it before.

859
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,630
I'll take this back and try it.

860
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,590
If it's good,
I'll send some to my parents too.

861
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,390
Yes, yes, yes.

862
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,550
If it's convenient for you,

863
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,410
leave an address
and we'll deliver it to your place.

864
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,850
You're too kind.

865
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,440
From now on,

866
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,370
if there's anything with Longwan,
just say the word.

867
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,840
There are indeed

868
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,880
some issues in development.

869
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,590
I'd like to get your advice.

870
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,380
"Advice" might be too much to say.

871
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,960
What problems are you facing now?

872
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,490
I'll help you sort them out.

873
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,630
Well—

874
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,440
I just want to do

875
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,140
what I can

876
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,810
for my hometown.

877
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,170
I heard Mr. Qiao of Chengjian Group

878
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,630
has quite a bit of influence.

879
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,090
I'd like to get to know him.

880
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,940
Mr. Liu, you're

881
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,980
interested in
development zone construction?

882
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,570
As for Qiao,

883
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,110
I know him pretty well.

884
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,320
Making an introduction
isn't difficult, but

885
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,890
whether you can get on that train

886
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,710
depends on you.

887
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,310
We'll definitely work hard.

888
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,440
Thank you, Director.

889
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,960
Come on.

890
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,420
Director.

891
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,110
Director, let me introduce someone to you.

892
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,000
This is the hotel manager.

893
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,530
Ms. Zhou.

894
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,710
This is Director Chen.

895
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,550
Nice to meet you, Director Chen.

896
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,150
Nice to meet you,

897
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,150
Just call me Sisi.

898
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,280
On behalf of our restaurant,

899
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
I'd like to give you

900
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,130
a VIP card.

901
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,340
You're always welcome to come by.

902
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,470
You're too polite.

903
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,190
Such a beautiful manager—

904
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,550
I'll definitely be
coming here often in the future.

905
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,110
Director Chen, let me toast you.

906
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,440
Come on.

907
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,360
We'll join you for a drink.

908
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,190
Come on.

909
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,180
Director Chen.

910
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:08,760
Not bad.

911
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,880
Mr. Qiao,

912
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,310
what do you think of this place?

913
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,360
You can come here often in the future.

914
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,290
Not bad, not bad.

915
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,480
Elegant surroundings.

916
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,850
Quiet amid the bustle.

917
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,280
A rare and lovely spot.

918
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,250
You wouldn't know—

919
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,710
Mr. Liu from Longwan
heard you like fishing,

920
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,150
and drove around for days

921
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,550
to find a place like this.

922
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,070
We mainly have to thank Director Chen

923
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,230
for helping us arrange
this meeting with you, Mr. Qiao.

924
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,560
Actually, we're not very good with words,

925
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,440
but we sincerely want to work with you.

926
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,840
If you're willing to
give us this opportunity,

927
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,570
Longwan won't disappoint you.

928
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,400
Got one!

929
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,120
Such good luck today.

930
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:55,970
Come on.

931
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,630
I'll do it.

932
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,880
Every time a fish bites,

933
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,570
I always unhook it myself.

934
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,620
That's the fun.

935
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,230
Yes, yes.

936
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,030
Mr. Liu,

937
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,700
you don't fish very often, do you?

938
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,930
When we were kids by the sea, we all

939
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,510
used nets to catch fish.

940
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,960
Using nets was for survival.

941
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,820
Fishing isn't.

942
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,700
You try every possible way

943
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,020
to get the fish to bite,

944
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,070
and the fish

945
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
just won't.

946
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,980
It does everything it can to get away.

947
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,430
Fishing is interesting.

948
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,350
Fishing is like

949
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,000
a battle of wits.

950
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,330
Exactly.

951
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,630
That's very well said.

952
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,960
If I get the chance,

953
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
I'd really like to learn from you.

954
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,280
From me?

955
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,060
When I look at you,

956
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,970
I'm reminded of myself back then—

957
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,710
never letting any opportunity slip by.

958
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:55,540
But...

959
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,110
To be honest,

960
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,520
we really are short of a partner.

961
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,250
However, I need to see your capabilities.

962
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,180
How about this?

963
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,550
In the early stage, we'll treat it

964
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,070
as an investment on your end.

965
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,130
Once we're familiar with each other,

966
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,070
we can talk about
deeper cooperation later.

967
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,870
Rest assured.

968
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,050
We have no problem on the funding side.

969
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,440
Then let's find a time
to go over the contract.

970
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,500
Alright, Mr. Qiao.

971
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,260
I'll have them
draft the contract right away.
