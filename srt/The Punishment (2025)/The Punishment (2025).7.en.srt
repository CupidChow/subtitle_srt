It's no big deal for me.

191
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,550
Ten yuan is enough
for me to live on for a day.

192
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,150
But there are so many people here,

193
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,090
so many mouths waiting to be fed.

194
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,390
So what do you suggest?

195
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,260
I'm working on a solution
with the factory.

196
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,610
Can't you wait a little longer?

197
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,050
Wait?

198
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,250
Until when?

199
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,240
Until everyone starves to death?

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,970
Speak properly to Uncle Limin.

201
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,790
Tianfei.

202
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,010
Madam Wen is here.

203
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,010
Madam Wen is here.

204
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,500
So, everyone, what do you think?

205
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Well, Madam Wen,

206
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,410
when you ask like that,

207
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,440
who dares to speak up?

208
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,030
If you ask me,

209
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,740
we should

210
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,300
take another vote.

211
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,130
Right?

212
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
Whether people agree or not,

213
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,670
let's see what everyone thinks.

214
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,500
Okay.

215
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,150
I'd like to know what everyone thinks too.

216
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,690
Jiangyong,

217
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,540
call the representatives from each family

218
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,470
to come vote at the ancestral hall.

219
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,400
I was hoping you'd stir things up

220
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,680
and organize a vote,

221
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,460
to see if there's anyone
left in the village

222
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,070
who still supports Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

223
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,070
Let's see how many people
think differently than I do.

224
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,310
[Madam Wen] [Liu Tianfei] [Abstention]

225
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,390

226

Tianfei.

227
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,870
Madam Wen.

228
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,430
Madam Wen again.

229
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,110
Tianfei.

230
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,290
Madam Wen.

231
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Tianfei.

232
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,530
The results are in.

233
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,020
We all

234
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,740
don't need to say more, okay?

235
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,820
At least there are still people

236
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,270
who support my ideas.

237
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,420
Everyone wants what's best for Longwan.

238
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,660
I respect everyone's opinion.

239
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,310
[Madam Wen] [Liu Tianfei] [Abstention]

240
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,090
Fellow villagers,

241
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,580
I know everyone is very anxious right now.

242
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,750
If it was just about money,
that would be one thing.

243
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,750
But what they want to demolish now

244
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,270
is the home
we've depended on for 300 years.

245
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,990
We people of Longwan have come this far

246
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,510
by never bowing our heads

247
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,940
and never surrendering.

248
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,670
So I hope

249
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,670
that no matter what happens,

250
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,760
we can all stand united

251
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,670
and overcome these difficulties together.

252
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,640
Great!

253
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,290
Everyone has been sent out?

254
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes.

-Captain Ji.

256
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,230
Where are you going?

257
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,750
To a meeting. What else would I be doing?

258
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,250
So busy.

259
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,850
By the way,

260
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,550
that thing you mentioned last time,

261
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,210
Bole Finance—

262
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,510
how's the investigation going?

263
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,770
Didn't you say

264
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,460
this case wasn't your responsibility,

265
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,120
so you wouldn't get involved?

266
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,380
I'm just concerned about you two.

267
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,400
Don't even mention it.

268
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,930
It's really difficult
to investigate this company.

269
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,770
No progress after so many days.

270
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,020
Yeah,

271
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,300
we did some digging,

272
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,890
but couldn't find any connections.

273
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,560
See?

274
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,770
What did I tell you?

275
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,650
Technically,

276
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,740
Wang Ming's case

277
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,820
isn't my responsibility,
so I shouldn't interfere.

278
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,650
But if

279
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,580
it involves financial crimes,

280
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,790
you need to report to me promptly.

281
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,050
Don't worry, Captain Ji.

282
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,710
If he doesn't tell you, I will.

283
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,780
What are you talking about?

284
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,050
If I don't report
financial crimes to our Big Bro,

285
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,500
can you investigate if I tell you instead?

286
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,280
Look at that.

287
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,040

290
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,570
what I told you guys the other day.

291
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,840

Okay.

297
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,200
We're even keeping it from him?

298
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,290
No,

299
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,630
I just don't have any progress to report.

300
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,840
Did you set up that company?

301
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,890
It's done.

302
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,100

303
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,850
I did.

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,490
Two copies.

380
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,810
You can take a look

381
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,410
to see if there are any issues.

382
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,430
If everything looks good,

383
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,760
you can sign and seal it.

384
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,990
Yuhong,

385
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,460
transfer Tianfei's payment to him later.

386
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,210

389
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,700
I have something to do later.

390
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,970
You and Yuhong,

391
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,440
this afternoon, clear up our previous

392
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,990
mobile gambling operation accounts.

393
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,080
We can't operate for now,

394
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,230
but we can't leave those accounts hanging.

395
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,490
I have plans today too.

396
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,380
You have plans?

397
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,800
My dad and Mr. Ma

398
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,520
are meeting people
from Chengjian for dinner.

399
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,230
I need to go.

400
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,760
Nobody invited you?

401
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,770
I just said

402
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,200
I have plans.

403
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,810
-Done?
-It's done.

404
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,090
Keep this copy.

405
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,550
I'm leaving, Yuhong.

406
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,320
Okay.

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,920
Do you have plans tonight?

410
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I'd like to treat you to Japanese food.

411
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,980
Didn't you just say you have
a business dinner tonight?

412
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,400
What's the fun in dining with them?

413
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,520
If I want to enjoy my meal...

414
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,200
I've got to eat with you.

415
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,350
What a coincidence.

416
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,750
I'm on a diet these days,
not eating dinner.

417
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,870
Get out of here now.

418
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,770
I have a ton of things to do today, okay?

419
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,870
I'm not messing around with you anymore.

420
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,440
Save the work for another day.

421
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,099
Besides, with your figure,
why bother dieting?

422
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,910
If you're really that bored,

423
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,040
why don't you go home
and spend time with your wife and kids?

424
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,630
More importantly,
keep your father-in-law company.

425
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,450
We both rely on him to make money.

426
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,890
This is very important.

427
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,680
You've never been married.

428
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,089
You don't understand.

429
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,430
I don't have any passion left now.

430
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,150
What is passion?

431
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,150
Passion

432
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,280
is a man's lifeline.

433
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,240
If you can't stand it anymore,

434
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,570
then just get divorced.

435
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,170
Divorce would be easy.

436
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,560
It's just not the right time yet.

437
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,450
Not the right time.

438
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,210
Since you don't have the courage,

439
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,080
then just be a good son-in-law
who married into your wife's family.

440
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,030
I really don't have time for you today.

441
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
If you insist on staying here,

442
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,970
that's fine too.

443
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,240
You can have the office.

444
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,500
Take care of yourself.

445
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,250
I won't be keeping you company.

446
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,290
You really won't dine with me?

447
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,000
No time.

448
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,580
I'm leaving.

449
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,390
Take care.

450
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,430
Take care, Bo.

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,690
I ran into them while working.

455
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,060
That guy is your brother, right?

456
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,780
Yes.

457
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,480
How did he end up hanging out with Luo Bo?

458
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,560
Alright, I got it.

459
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,590
Come on.

460
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,150
Drink up today.

461
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,210
Yeah, drink as much as you want.

462
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,190
You can really hold your liquor, Mr. Liu.

463
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,520
I can't keep up with you.

464
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,590

465
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,220
No, no, no.

466
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,850
I can't handle it. I'm done.

467
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,790

You... why are you here?

471
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,240
Did you come by yourself?

472
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,630
Have a few drinks.

473
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,270
Come on.

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,560

No,

478
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,930
I...

479
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,680
I'm not close with Luo Bo.

480
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,830
You're still lying to me.

481
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm not lying to you.

482
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,480
Let's go.

483
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,540
Let's have a drink.

484
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,630
Come back with me.

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,520
Back?

486
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,320
Well, Feng,

487
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,110
my buddies are all here.

488
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,350
We're only halfway through our drinks.

489
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,430
Come back with me.

490
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Fine.

491
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,260
Um...

492
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,830
Um, hey guys, you go ahead and drink.

493
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,490
I need to...

494
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,480
-I’m going back.
-Where are you going?

495
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
The drinks are on me. Put it on my tab.

496
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,870
On you...

497
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,000
Feng, take it easy.

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,830
-Go in.
-I just want to make some money.

499
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,520
Mr. Luo...

500
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,110

502
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,870

503
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,830
I just went there...

504
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,070
-Stand here.
-It’s not illegal.

505
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,000
What's going on?

506
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,210
Did you know he's been
hanging around Luo Bo's place?

507
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,270
Shut up.

508
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,700
Tianye really didn't know.

509
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Do you know or not?

510
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,380
I sent him there.

511
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,630
You want him to die?

512
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,460
Well.

513
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,150
We civilians also want to
take down Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

514
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,670
Right.

515
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,130
Otherwise none of us
will ever have a good life.

516
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,580
I'm just trying to help, that's all.

517
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,440
Besides, he...

518
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,760
He has a proper image.

519
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,690
A proper what?

520
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:14,870
Image.

521
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,740
Just look at him.

522
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,420
Right, put your hands in your pockets.

523
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,880
Yes, in your back pockets.

524
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,680
Look at him.

525
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,250
You definitely can't find
someone like him at your place.

526
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,560
He's perfect to send to Luo Bo.

527
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,410
They will trust
someone who looks like that.

528
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,280
Afterward, we'll work with you
from the inside and outside.

529
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,670
-Police and the people—one family, right?
-Yes, we are a family.

530
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,270
With this image,
he can go deep behind enemy lines?

531
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,930
My image...

532
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,380
You think we can't get things done?

533
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,810
No.

534
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,440
We have to count on you
to help gather information?

535
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,100
What's wrong with my image...

536
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,140
Just shut up.

537
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm worried about
procedural complications for you.

538
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,340
Aren't you fooling around?

539
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,800
What are you doing hanging out there?

540
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,260
I wasn't just hanging out.

541
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,350
Tianye said I have a proper image.

542
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,170
So how could my image be bad?

543
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,490
Besides, I didn't go there for nothing.

544
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,980
Feng, let me show you.

545
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,450
See for yourself.

546
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,120
Got a lead?

547
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,630
Of course I have a lead.

548
00:21:59,740 --> 00:21:59,800
A payment record, isn't it?

549
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,060

credited to your debit card.]

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,750
See for yourself.

552

They just transferred money to me.

554
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,210
I've already found out the name for you.

555
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,050
Let me tell you.

556
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,440
All their money goes through this company.

557
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,350
No matter what it is,

558
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,110
loan shark money,

559
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,080
gambling money, whatever,

560
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,610
it all passes through them.

561
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,340
You know Song Hao, right?

562
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,000
He's the one who gave them this idea.

563
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,080
And Song Hao

564
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,030
is very close to a woman known as...

565
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,530
Yuhong,

566
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,700
the company's owner.

567
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,900
You can follow this lead

568
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,990
and you'll definitely find something.

569
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,390
Isn't this a useful lead?

570
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,590
Isn't it?

571
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,690
So this is what you two
have been plotting.

572
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,140
Tell me if this lead is useful or not.

573
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,190
You sent him there
as an undercover, didn't you?

574
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,590
Well, didn't we say

575
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,000
that police and people are one family?

576
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,190
Have you lost your mind?

577
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,450
How can they trust you?

578
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,480
You're even trying to set them up?

579
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,960
Why wouldn't they trust me?

580
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,590
Stand right there.

581
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,250
Don't move.

582
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,860
You sent him to Luo Bo's place.

583
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,480
Are you afraid he's not
learning bad habits fast enough?

584
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,340
-Well.
-I didn't mean it that way.

585
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,180
You

586
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,860
sent him to Luo Bo's place.

587
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,240
How can he have a good future?

588
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,630
Just tell me whether it's useful or not.

589
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,720
Don't give me that nonsense.

590
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,970
Starting today,

591
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,460
stay away from these people.

592
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,370
Don't go there anymore.

593
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,000
Understand?

594
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,480
Well,

595
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,520
Ma Jin and Luo Bo already trust me.

596
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,830
-I have a lot of things to do.
-Trust you? Do you even look trustworthy?

597
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,680
Trust you, really?

598
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,590
He's worried about you.
Quickly apologize to Officer Qin.

599
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,140
I already...

600
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,900
Apologize.

601
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,610
Say sorry.

602
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,060
Say sorry.

603
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm sorry.

604
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,830
Sorry.

605
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,400
Enough. You have no discipline.

606
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,500
You're just fooling around with him

607
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,290
and trying to deceive me.

608
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:22,870
Keep an eye on him.

609
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not deceiving you. I understand.

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,780
Are we eating or not?

611
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,090
Always leading the trouble.

612
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,150
Fine, let's go eat.

613
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,390
If you lie to me again...

614
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,560
If you lie to me again, I'm telling you...

615
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,830
I want to do some legitimate work too.

616
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,900
But...

617
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,060
Come work for us
as an auxiliary police officer.

618
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,870
That's legitimate work.

619
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,370
Will you go?

620
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,180
Yes, I will.

621
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,050
I'll go if you pay me.

622
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,930
This should be their headquarters.

623
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,700
But I still don't understand

624
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,810
how they launder money through gaming.

625
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,760
Organize events, give out prizes,

626
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,580
buy game cards and virtual items,

627
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,380
and with all this back and forth,

628
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,850
the money gets laundered.

629
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,390
Tao.

630
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,860
Do you know there's a game

631
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,530
where there's a knife called

632
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,320
Xuanwu Rakshasa Blade?

633
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,120
Do you know how much does it sell for?

634
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,870
66,000.

635
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,700
How much?

636
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,310
66,000 per blade.

637
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,250
In RMB?

638
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:30,920
Yes,

639
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,920
and that's not even
the most expensive one.

640
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,190
Everything in this game

641
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,170
can be sold like this.

642
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,030
Otherwise how could this lousy company

643
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,030
launder 6 to 7 million yuan

644
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,780
a month?

645
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,480
Wait.

646
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,230
How do you know so much about it?

647
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,250
Do you play these games?

648
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,950
I don't. I can't afford it.

649
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,080
Boys in my class used to play it

650
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,430
and talked about it constantly.

651
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,690
I learned all about it just by listening.

652
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,230
[Rainbow Network Co., Ltd.]

653
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,890
This is all about the recent investigation
into Rainbow Network.

654
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,430
Their company bought

655
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,360
lots of ID cards and bank accounts.

656
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,590
It's basically money laundering.

657
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,170
I have an idea.

658
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,570
First, we should

659
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,570
use some technical investigation methods

660
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,320
to freeze their accounts

661
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,450
to prevent further losses.

662
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,230
Captain Zhong,

663
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,440
this is all part
of our investigation process.

664
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,640
When we find problems, we stop the losses.

665
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,470
Using some tactics

666
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,250
is nothing to be afraid of.

667
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,280
Alright.

668
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,150
No rush.

669
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,220
Take your time to consider it.

670
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,920
There's been a lot going on lately.

671
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,420
Recently I've been
hearing from other departments

672
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,680
talking about
our Criminal Investigation Detachment...

673
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,180
What are they saying?

674
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,540
They say we're

675
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,210
just relying on Director Ye

676
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,940
without producing results.

677
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,200
That we're ineffective,

678
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,380
can't catch criminals,

679
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,640
and can't solve cases.

680
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,550
Nonsense!

681
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,770
Haven't we solved plenty of cases?

682
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,380
We saved so many victims!

683
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,790
We've arrested plenty of criminals.

684
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,090
How can they say we're not working?

685
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,420
Exactly!

686
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,160
We've solved

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
every single case

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,970
and arrested tons of people,

689
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,320
but it doesn't matter.

690
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,060
I've been thinking about this at home.

691
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,620
When it comes down to it,

692
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,860
what's the real problem?

693
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,950
The cases are too trivial.

694
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,610
Who cares if we're
just arresting people for fights

695
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,010
and minor disturbances?

696
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,900
But this time is truly different.

697
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,160
The amount of money involved in this case

698
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,030
is big enough.

699
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,200
Once we take these people down,

700
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,910
everyone will shut up.

701
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,030

703
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,590
as long as we catch them

704
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,560
and investigate thoroughly,

705
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,490

714
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,040
They say we're ineffective,

715
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,760
so we need to

716
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,470
make a good impression

proceed

733

drop the case?

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,710
care about these relationships
and interests you speak of?

942
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,920
With all these incidents

943
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
that have happened one after another,

944
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,860
I think he's getting serious now.

945
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,150
We should still
try to find out more about...

946
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,080
Ye Tianyou?

947
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,540
We already have leverage over his nephew.

948
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,070
Sooner or later,
he'll be begging me for help.

949
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,410
Yuhong.

950
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,880
I know these years
have been difficult for you

951
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,080
as a woman on your own.

952
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,670
And you don't have much of a background.

953
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,990
Actually,

954
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,280
you can rely on me.

955
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,790
The money has been delivered to you.

956
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,250
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

957
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,060
Yuhong.

958
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,130
What's the rush?

959
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,000
It's still early.

960
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Here, have a seat.

961
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,060
Let's chat for a while.

962
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,310
Let's have dinner together tonight, okay?

963
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,970
Yuhong.

964
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,400
Stay with me.

965
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,270
Don't leave today.

966
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,920
Will you?

967
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,290
Be good.

968
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,370
Don't be like this.

969
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,450
You've been tired all day.

970
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,610
Let me help you take off your shoes.

971
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,710
Song Hao.

972
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,450
Song Hao!

973
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,930
I'm talking to you
about something important.

974
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,170
I'm telling you,
this money issue isn't over.

975
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,190
If Ma Jin starts blaming us later,

976
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,650
neither of us will escape.

977
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,130
How dare you mention Ma Jin to me?

978
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,040
All these years, behind our backs,

979
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,450
how much of Ma Jin's money have you kept?

980
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,710
You think I don't know?

981
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,610
Ma Jin doesn't tolerate any deception.

982
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,710
You know

983
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,030
what he's capable of.

984
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,350
I can keep your secret.

985
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,880
How you respond

986
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,160
is up to you.

987
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,360
I know you need something from me.

988
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,070
Go ahead.

989
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,110
What can I do for you?

990
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,610
Is there any way

991
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,700
you can help me transfer money abroad

992
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,680
and get me a foreign identity?

993
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,680
What's wrong?

994
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,670
Are the police after you?

995
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,210
It was a close call.

996
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,290
Luckily I deleted the files in time.

997
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,230
To be honest, Biao,

998
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,440
you're the only person I can trust now.

999
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,490
Don't worry.

1000
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:41,840
I'll definitely

1001
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,460
take care of your matter.

1002
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,490
Thank you, Biao.

1003
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,350
Here.

1004
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,730
You're clearly insulting me.

1005
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,580
Our relationship

1006
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,180
can't be measured by money.

1007
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,540
The closer the friends,

1008
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,000
the more important
it is to return the favor.

1009
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,700
Take a look first.

1011

This can't be...

1012
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,370
Yes, it is.

1013
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,700
After Master Jingxin
read your birth chart,

1014
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,160
he wrote this personally.

1015
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,580
I've admired Master Jingxin for so long.

1016
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,380
Never had the chance to meet him.

He Muzhi, He Muzhi.

1019
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
That's truly a good name.

1020
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,320
You've looked after me all these years.

1021
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,600
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

1022
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,320
Take good care of yourself.

1023
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,990
Go.

1024
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,220
Go.

1025
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm leaving.

1026
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,350

1027
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,580
You've set the mood lighting

1028

1031
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,620
is Ma Jin's person.

1032
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,830
If you help her like this,

1033
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,270
and Ma Jin finds out,

1034
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,070
won't it be bad for us?

1035
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,620
You're right.

1036
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,500
But, Gang,

1037
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,060
between Yuhong and me,

1038
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,260
it's purely a spiritual connection.

1039
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,430

genuine admiration for her.

Don't just sit there.

1045
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,060
I can help you with your math homework.

1046
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,750
But you need to do Chinese on your own.

1047
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,880
The Chinese homework is due tomorrow.

I'm tired.

1050
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,610
I'll finish it in the morning.

1051
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,870
Fine.

1052
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,350

1055
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,390
Why don't you just check the answers?

1056
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,360
You don't know how to solve it anyway.

1057
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,990
Who says I can't solve it?

Besides,

1059
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,100
solving problems
isn't just about the result.

00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,300
The process matters.

Well,

I can do your homework for you.

1063
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,020
But you need to master
the knowledge yourself.

00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,750
Understand?

1065
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,140
Okay, Dad.

1066
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,270
Then please write out the process too.

00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,140
Can you solve this problem?

1071
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,080
Do you guys even know how to solve this?

1072
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,200
You definitely
need to eliminate these first.

1073

Let me tell you,

1074
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,230
solving problems like this

1075
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,800
is just like how your dad solves cases.

1076
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,420
You need to go through the process.

1077
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,220
If you don't understand the process,

1078
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,790
you'll get stuck again
when you see the same kind of problems.

1079
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,830
So with this problem,

1080
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,790
if you don't know how to solve it,

1081
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,430

If Captain Zhong
didn't leak the information,

1114
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,440
then that day in the office,

1115

and Yang.

1119
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,620
How could you rule out all those leaders?

1120
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,280
You can't just say things like that.

1121
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm not just saying things.

1122
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,950
I'm just talking to you.

1123
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,440
I think we should
keep a close eye on Qian Yuhong.

1124
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,270
But I think

1125
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,400
she's just one of Ma Jin's underlings.

1126
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,700
Just like Scar, Damao, and Ermao.

1127
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,700
Even if we arrest her,

1128
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,160
she probably won't reveal anything useful.

1129
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,020
Should we try

1130
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,180
a different approach?

1131
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,580
Like psychological tactics or something?

1132
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,710
How would we do that?

1133
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,670
Human nature is selfish.

1134
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,910
The online gaming company
has been shut down.

1135
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,770
I don't believe she's not scared.

1136
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:51,950
Alright,

1137
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,730
I'll ask Mai to look into it.

1138
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,140
Quickly take the child home.

1139
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,600
Put the bag around my neck.

1140
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,830
Okay, go.

1141
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm leaving.

1142
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,480
