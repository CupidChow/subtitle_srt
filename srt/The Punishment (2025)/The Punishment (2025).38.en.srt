You've put it on.

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,560
How do I look?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,970
Great. You look smart in it.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,980
Is it too short?

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,870
Not at all. Jiangyan made a good pick.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,550
I look spirited this way.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,640
It'll work perfectly

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,030
for my business meeting today.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,560
You should also wear it
outside of business meetings.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
This is an expensive jacket.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,880
I'd rather save it
for important occasions.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
I'll buy you a few more
so you can rotate them for daily wear.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,350
Are you rich now?

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,960
Feng!

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,130
Perfect timing.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,240
You both look sharp.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,200
Let me take a photo of you two.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,750
Okay.

20
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,280
Where did you get this camera?

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,540
Crazy bought it for me.

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,880
It cost him half of his salary.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,200
The major part of the rest
went to your jacket,

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
and what little was left
to an outfit for Mom.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,280
This month was a total wash for him.

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,920
That's fine.

Try to be more frugal with your money.

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,520
Couldn't you have saved some up?

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,200
I'll receive a salary again next month.
What's there to worry about?

30
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,030
You should've saved some up.
Just listen to me.

31
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,200
But what was the point?

32
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,030
-Hurry.
-You can't go on in this way.

33
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,510
-Time for a photo.
-Come on. Look at the camera.

34
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,790
The purchase has been made anyway.
Might as well take a photo.

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,680
Three, two, one.

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,690
Tianye, can you look more cheerful?

37
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,950
Try another pose.

38
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,730
Okay. Let's try another pose.

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,710
With you in that uniform...

40
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,440
this posture seems a bit weird.

41
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,039
Alright.

42
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,950
Try another one.

43
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,510
Another one?

44
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,870
Here comes my signature pose.

55

Tianye said he'd stay.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,060
Then I'll stay too.

57
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,630
I plan to turn myself in.

58
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,460
Let me take the fall instead.

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,630
Tianfei,

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,540
you're not connected to Tianyun.

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,050
Only I am the chairman of it.

62
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,150
Then...

63
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,520
Why not tell the police

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
that I forced you to do all those crimes?

65
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,829
I didn't say much to you before.

66
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,940
But now I hope
you'll pull yourself together

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,180
and help Tianye.

68
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,440

72
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,600
Shall I tidy it up? Seems too messy.

73
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
Put the goods in order then.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,410
Okay.

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,920
I'll take it out for you, alright?

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,560
Okay.

77
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,950
Just put it there.

78
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,510
Got it.

starting with Guazi,

87
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,480
and then Zhang Xin.

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,980
You know how to, right?

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
Previously,

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,570
we investigated Guazi.

91
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,240
He's from Shuikou Village.

92
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,630
There was

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,560
a poisoning case there.

94
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
The suspect was a man

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,510
named Xiong Chao.

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,950
You can look into it.

97
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,090
You know about Meng Yu, right?

98
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,190
Where is she now?

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,390
I don't know this woman
you're looking for,

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,520
but this might help.

101
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,870
It was left by Ma Jin.

102
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,360
I guess what's written
is some bank accounts and codes.

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,070
Anyway,

104
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,870
they must be related
to Hong Mushou's dirty stuff.

105
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,690
I'll let you know when I have a finding.

106
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,830
Feng.

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,490
After taking them down,

108
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,760
what will you do?

109
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,240
Then I'll have to deal with you.

110
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,520
How's it going?

111
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,890
Why did you suddenly ask me to review
the archives about Shuikou Village?

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,540
Captain Qin told me

113
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,669
about a poisoning case there,

114
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,909
which might be related to Guazi.

115
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,870
I just sorted out some information.

116
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,360
The main cause of this poisoning case

117
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,549
was a conflict

118
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,960
between Xiong Chao and a neighbor of his

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
over a government project
of land acquisition.

120
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,360
Xiong Chao got a life sentence
for poisoning this neighbor and his wife,

121
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
who both ended up in a vegetative state.

122
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,670
The key part is,

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,480
Xiong Chao then applied for medical parole

124
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,550
and was released.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Medical parole?

126
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,630
Shortly after that,

127
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,320
Xiong died accidentally and was removed
from the household register.

128
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,440
Wasn't it too convenient?

129
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,840
Are you suspecting Xiong Chao was actually

130
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,030
Guazi?

131
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,440
Look at this.

132
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,950
Back then, Xiong Chao's attorney

133
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
was Zhang Xin.

134
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,160
Zhang Xin was his defending lawyer.

135
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,690
Could it be possible that Xiong Chao...

136
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,590
actually lived on,

137
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,750
got hidden by Zhang Xin,

138
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,040
and started working for her thereafter?

139
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,900
That was probably the case.

140
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,280
Crime becomes easier
when one has a dead man's identity.

141
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,810
We're still trying to crack

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,170
those numbers and codes that are probably

143
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,440
related to Hong Mushou.

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Any updates

145
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,870
on Meng Yu?

146
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,380
We've traced her phone number,
bank cards, home address,

147
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,150
and all her information online.

148
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,530
But she seems to have vanished
into thin air.

149
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,150
I've heard she's not even in contact

150
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
with her schoolmates and teachers.

151
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,050
Wait, she has family, doesn't she?

152
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,770
A living person can't just...

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,360
disappear like that.

154
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,950
Her parents divorced long ago.

155
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,190
Her father

156
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
works in another city

157
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
and barely contacts her and her mother.

158
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,750
A neighbor of hers told me

159
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,750
that her mother

160
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,150
received a sum of money a few days ago

161
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,840
and just left afterwards.

162
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,000
But guys,

163
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,000
don't worry.

164
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,900
Yuan Song and his fellows

165
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,030
are looking into it.

166
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,080
Okay.

167
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,330
That said,
we must do something about Zhang Xin.

168
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,830
Since Zhang Xin has a connection
with Guazi,

169
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,900
let's use him to urge Zhang Xin
to make a move.

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,630
What's your plan?

171
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,390
I suggest we send

172
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,700
someone to meet

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,510
Xiong Chao's parents in Shuikou Village.

174
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,510
We might get through to them, right?

175
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
The bureau must be

176
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,010
investigating these matters too.

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
I know.

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,030
But the bureau's approaches

179
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,020
might not work well in a place like that.

180
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,920
So I propose we try a different way.

181
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,020
Shall I call Jiu?

182
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Jiu,

183
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,390
do you know anyone in Shuikou Village?

184
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,620
Come in!

185
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,750
Director Peng,

186
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,080
we've found out Guazi's real identity

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,670

withheld information.

for breaking Xiong Chao down

Even if Zhang Xin can't be
held accountable for other cases,

296

[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

375
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,840
I'll go back to my office.

376
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,170
Try to be more patient.

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,480
[Responsive and Authoritative]
[Impartial and Upright]

378
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,920
Sir.

379
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,680
The police have figured out
Xiong Chao's real identity

380
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,410
and that you helped him before.

381
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,350
Peng

382
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,310
has temporarily got you off the hook.

383
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,330
But you could be arrested anytime

384
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,930
if they attain a teensy bit more evidence.

385
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,580
Xiong Chao won't talk.

386
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,510
Otherwise,

387
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,590
I wouldn't have used him for so long.

388
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,420
You may be at ease, but I'm not.

389
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,110
He knows too many things.

390
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,030
I've decided...

391
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,070
to dispose of him for you.

392
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,440
It's time you left.

393
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,880
Kang has made proper arrangements for you.

394
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,230
Complete the handover

395
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,880
as soon as possible.

396
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,110
Why?

397
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,680
Why is it me who's leaving?

398
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,050
After spending so many years in Hanzhou,

399
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,790
I have nothing to show for it.

400
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,290
Two decades of hard work

401
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,680
has gone down the drain.

402
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,030
It's just like a joke.

403
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,750
When you dragged me into this years ago,

404
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,530
you should have seen this day coming.

405
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,130
Don't describe yourself
as some sort of saint.

406
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,790
Back then, you were a widely acclaimed

407
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,640
rising star.

408
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,610
But now you're even inferior to me.

409
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,320
On the day I took you to bed,

410
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,920
we became birds of a feather.

411
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,880
You accepted all the girls

412
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,110
I sent to you, didn't you?

413
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,850
At those times,

414
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,360
did you see this day coming?

415
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,850
Don't you ever think
you can raise your voice to me

416
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,030
now that you've got some dirt on me.

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,110
I gave you

418
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,470
everything you have today.

419
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,250
You'd better know your place.

420
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,550
I'm already preserving your dignity
by letting you leave.

421
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,470
You should be satisfied.

422
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,470
I don't need you to preserve my dignity.

423
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,160
It is high time

424
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,400
you thought about
how to wrap up this mess.

425
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,230
Ms. Zhang.

426
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,620
Did the boss tell you?

427
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,470
Yes.

428
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,550
He instructed me

429
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,280
to keep the item safe for now.

430
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,640
The police might be watching you
in Hanzhou.

431
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,240
So the boss has planned
a special route for you.

432
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,070
Ms. Zhang,

433
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
what else can I do for you?

435
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,600
Nothing.

436
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,780
That's all. Let's go.

437
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,430
Okay.

438
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,400
Ms. Zhang,

439
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,350
this is as far as I can get you.

440
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,470
I wish you a safe journey.

441
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,340
Thank you for all you've done
in these years.

442
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,310
There is 5 million

443
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,510

444
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Take it.

445
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Don't go back to the boss.

446
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
Start a new life somewhere else.

447
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

449
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,480

[He Kang, Son of Hong Mushou's Cousin]

452
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,180
I've taken care of her.

453
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,960
Zhang Xin

454
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,830
must die.

455
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,300
Or she'll be too big a liability to us.

456
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,930
What are you guys doing?

457
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,050
Help!

458
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,680
Alright.

459
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Stop beating him.

460
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,700
It's enough.

462
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,970
Mr. Liu, please help me!

463
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,920
I've been nothing but obedient

464
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,240
to you over all these years.

465
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,170
I've never offended you in any way!

466
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,970
Take a look.

467
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,390

468
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,030
what these stand for,

469
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,400

470
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,460
How did you get these?

471
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,350
I'm asking you,

472
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,020
not the other way around.

473
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,780
What's this stuff?

474
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,290
You won't talk, huh?

475
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,310
Fine.

476
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
Keeping silent, huh?

477
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,510
Okay.

478
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,570
Stay quiet then.

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Very tight-lipped, aren't you?

480
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,530
Will you talk or not?

481
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,520
Confess or what?

482
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,480

483
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,300
If I tell the truth, I'll die!

484
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,720
All of you will die too!

485
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,110
Say it,

486
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,780
or your life ends now.

487
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,770
I'll tell the truth!

488
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,720
I will! I will!

489
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,590
I'll tell you everything!

490
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,400
Those...

491
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,350
are Mayor Hong's
overseas nominee accounts.

492
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,260
Zhang Xin had me manage them before.

493
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,730
Give me those accounts.

494
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,790
All of them.

495
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,500
I don't have them with me.

496
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,830
Now, they're all

497
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,230
being managed by Kang, Zhang Xin's driver.

498
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,800
You should talk to Kang

499
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,920
instead of me!

500
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,570
A pair of eights.

501
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,590
A pair of twos.

502
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,870
I'll pass.

503
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,360
A four.

504
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,270
Sir,

505
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,730
Zhang Xin went missing.

506
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
How did that happen?

507
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,180
We've been watching the several places

508
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,160
owned by Zhang Xin,

509
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
but there's been no sign of her.

510
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,300
Besides, her driver, He Kang,

511
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,510
is out of contact now.

512
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,980
They've likely fled.

513
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,790
I'm afraid

514
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,320
there might be an incident.

515
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,190
Once the police break Guazi down,

516
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,930
Zhang Xin will surely try to flee.

517
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,260
We can't let her escape.

518
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,480
Escape?

519
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,440
Not a chance.

520
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,160
You think she can flee that easily?

521
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,690
Then you're suggesting...

522
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,300
Listen,

523
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,670
a golden opportunity is coming our way—

524
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
presented by her driver.

525
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,550
If you want to live,

526
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,370
keep your mouth shut.

538
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,240
How ungrateful.

539
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,300
This is not confinement.
We just want you to stay here for a bit.

540
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,830
So what if we do confine you?

541
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,030
Zhang Xin,

542
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,550
to be honest,

543
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,270
if you weren't still useful to us,

544
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,640
we would have sat back
and watched you die,

545
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,590
because you deserve it.

546
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,310
Look, you're a mother.

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,600
your daughter's age,
and so is Meng Yu, right?

550
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,880
To curry favor with Hong Mushou,

551
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,340
you committed great evil.

552
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,090
Don't you deserve the worst punishment?

553
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,480
Captain Qin,

554
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,810
what exactly do you want to talk about?

555
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,110
Nothing much.

556
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,560
Do you know where Meng Yu is?

557
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,890
Say something.
Do you have the answer or not?

558
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,830
You're still keeping it secret.

559
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,960
I really wonder why.

560
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,720

you would have died there, you know?

562
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Would you be sitting here right now?

563
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,030
Why not just confess?

564
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,250
You're truly ungrateful.

565
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,440
Zhang Xin, I suggest you tell the truth.

566
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,350
After all, this is

567
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,110
your only chance to survive.

568
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,450
I'm done talking to you.

569
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,270
Tell us where she is if you know.

570
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
If you don't know,

571
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,750
I'll send a photo of you and this location
to those people.

572
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,510
When they arrive,

573
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,720
sort out the problem yourselves.

574
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,350
Alright?

575
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,470
It's not that easy for you

576
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,750
to bring the boss down.

577
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,200
That's for us to worry about.

578
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,460
All you need to do is tell us
what you know.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,130
I really have no idea

580
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,240
where Meng Yu is.

581
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,960
I bet you have the answer
to the next question.

582
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,690
What's this?

583
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,830
You got it from Liu Tianye?

584
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,890
Just answer my question.
Who are you to ask me anything?

585
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,020
These numbers and codes

586
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,250
are properties and accounts
held by those women

587
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,250
for Hong Mushou.

588
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,620
Previously, Meng Yu was at the Rome Hotel,

589
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,490
where he kept many of his women.

590
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,200
But after I left,

591
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,860
they must've been relocated.

592
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,170
Right now,

593
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,920
Meng Yu is probably being watched by Kang.

594
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,830
Do you know how to find her?

595
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,360
She goes to Bo'ai Hospital

596
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,219
for check-ups on a regular basis.

597
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,590
You can follow that lead.

598
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:29,929
Come in!

599
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,150
Director Chu, Director Ye,

600
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,270
Qin Feng and Mai have come here

601
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,250
with someone.

602
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,260
It's Zhang Xin.

603
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,690
Let them in.

604
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,040
Don't look at me.

605
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,949
I didn't tell them to catch her.

606
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,659
Come on in.

607
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,710
Sirs.

608
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,360
We've brought her here.

609
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,110
Zhang Xin,

610
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,800
long time no see.

611
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,300
We thought you had got in trouble.

612
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,870
Luckily, no, thanks to your mentees.

613
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,440
Yuan Song,

614
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,610
lead everyone out.

615
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,920
-Come on. Move.
-Let's go.

616
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,840
-Move.
-Go.

617
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,250
The floor's yours.

618
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,230
Come on.

619
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
Explain the whole thing.

620
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,630
Mentor,

621
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,510
Director Chu,

622
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,110
we intercepted Zhang Xin

623
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,850
when she tried to flee.

624
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,320
We also got some information from her.

625
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,670
There's a major breakthrough,

626
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,600
I'm telling you.

627
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,760
What now?

628
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,360
Are you expecting praise?

629
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,600
I already told you to report

630
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,170
any developments in a timely manner.

631
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,000
We're here to make a report now.

632
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,510
Exactly.

633
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,030
Right?

634
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,060
We've brought Zhang Xin here as well.

635
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,550
Behind those numbers

636
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,570
hide Hong Mushou's assets.

637
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,030
We've also got a clue about Meng Yu.

638
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,030
Bo'ai Hospital might lead us to her.

639
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,760
Qin Feng!

640
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,570
I know why you resigned.

641
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,840
I also know...

642
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
what intention you harbors.

643
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,590
The Municipal Bureau plans
to transfer Qin Feng to a secondary role,

644
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,720
but he has submitted his resignation.

645
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,760
Qin Feng resigned?

646
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,710
Yes.

647
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,070
Get in the car.

648
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,420
You and your fellows

649
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,990
are each more stubborn than the last.

650
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,990
I'm perfectly fine
with quitting the force.

651
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,650
I know what you're planning to do.

652
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,350
The organization

653
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,530
has deliberated on your resignation.

654
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,950
The higher-ups would like you

655
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,760
to process it as normal

656
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,200
and follow the standard procedure

657
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,250
to make this act look convincing.

658
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,880
Since you'd like to serve your part
as a concerned citizen,

659
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,940
let's collaborate
as police and a civilian.

660
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:17,140
The information you provided earlier
was valuable.

661
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,990
But now I must warn you both
that you're in

662
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,400
a very dangerous position.

663
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,590
You're only one step away

664
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,590
from a dark abyss.

665
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
You're not only in danger,

666
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,870
but also in for more than you can handle.

667
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes, right.

668
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,920
Yuan Song,

669
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,870
take them to verify the information.

670
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,800
Find that girl as soon as possible.

671
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,320
Yes.

672
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,180
Let's go verify the information!

673
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,650
Mentor, Director Chu,

674
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,050
please don't be mad. I...

675
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,600
Look at these two mentees of yours.

676
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,360
They're really like you.

677
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,770
These lads have gone a bit out of line.

678
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,970
They have a clear target—

679
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,330
Hong Mushou.

680
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,000
Plus,

681
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,340
Qin Feng is highly capable.

682
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,480
He's trying to help us

683
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,740
through his connection with Liu Tianye.

684
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,320
But I think we must keep stern

685
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,720
in this matter

686
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,890
and never let them go rogue

687
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,670
or even become loose cannons.

688
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,190
Don't worry.

689
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,190
I'll talk to them.

690
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,000
But Chu,

691
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,230
as I was saying,

692
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,700
I know these two mentees of mine too well.

693
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,070
They're as stubborn as a mule

694
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,320
and hell-bent on their own courses.

695
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,450
Yes. Like mentor, like mentee, right?

696
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,880
Tell me what you've planned for them.

697
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,800
In my opinion,

698
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,570
there's no use

699
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,710
stopping them.

700
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,280
It's better
to make use of their strengths.

701
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,960
After all,

702
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,360
they've obtained many valuable leads.

703
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,280
Okay.

704
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
I'll leave them to your discretion then.

705
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,520
I allow them to assist
with the investigation,

706
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,670
but they must be kept under control.

707
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,000
In particular,
Qin Feng has to recuse himself

708
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
from matters concerning Liu Tianye.
That's a rule

709
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,760
Rest assured.

710
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,510
He's well aware of that.

711
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,920
It's been over 10 years

712
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,080
since Xu Li's case.

713
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,670
The two of them
have been persistently working on it.

714
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,120
There's one thing I can guarantee:

715
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,280
they are both trustworthy.

716
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,690
I remember this girl.

717
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,360
I gave her check-ups before.

718
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,280
But I don't think...

719
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,850
her name is Meng Yu.

720
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:45,720
[Hanzhou Bo'ai Hospital]

721
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,390
Officers, please wait a moment.

722
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,710
Look,

723
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,820
this is her medical record
in our hospital.

724
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
[Name: Li Mengyu]

725
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,080
Her name is Li Mengyu.

726
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,280
Who was she with when she received

727
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,210
check-ups here?

728
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,060
As I recall, she was accompanied
by two male relatives.

729
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,550
She's been here twice.

730
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,310
We've made a house call once.

731
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,590
The doctors here make house calls?

732
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,230
Yes.

733
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
Our medical vans would usually park

734
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,760
in the underground garages
of residential buildings

735
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
for pick-up and drop-off services.

736
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,050
My sister knows this girl.

737
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,680
She can do us a favor.

738
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,460
[Hanzhou Bo'ai Hospital]

739
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,490
Why not call her now?

740
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,520
A pair of sevens.

741
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,120
A pair of sevens?

742
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,990
A pair of tens.

743
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,830
A pair of aces.

744
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,070
That's too much.

745
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,670
I'll pass.

746
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,570
