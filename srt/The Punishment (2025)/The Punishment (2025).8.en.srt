00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,390
This way?

190
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,870
Yes.

191
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,360
I was just telling Ji we went too far.

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,960
Mr. Luo!

193
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,150
Mr. Ma.

194
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,570
Have a seat.

195
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,000
What's with the online gaming company?

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,040
What went wrong?

197
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,300
I'm puzzled too.

198
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
Could Scar and his people

199
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,290
have confessed?

200
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,350
No way.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Scar has worked for me for many years

202
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,700
and been through a lot.

203
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,840
He's tighter-lipped than anyone.

204
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,250
People are unpredictable.

205
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
You can't fully trust them.

206
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,980
Cut that crap.

207
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,480
You would've got in trouble already

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
if I hadn't reminded you.

209
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,630
It was you who raised the idea

210
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,150
and engaged Qian Yuhong in this.

211
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,100
The mistake must be on your side.

212
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,330
Mr. Luo, calm down.

213
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,830
The root cause

214
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,030
of this predicament

215
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,960
is Qin Feng—such a pain in the neck.

216
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,150
Weren't those establishments

217
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,150
of yours shut down

218
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,250
by Qin Feng not long ago, Mr. Luo?

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,890
I've cleaned up my own mess,

220
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,100
while yours is yet to be dealt with.

221
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,870
Mr. Luo, at this time,

222
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,550
it's pointless to hurl insults
at each other.

223
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,550
The priority is to solve the problem.

224
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,080
We've

225
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,550
suffered financial losses,

226
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,480
but Qin Feng hasn't found any evidence.

227
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
So, I think

228
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,330
all is fine.

229
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,120
Tell Qian Yuhong to turn herself in.

230
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,390
That's not necessary at the moment, is it?

231
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,960
It takes time to prepare witnesses,

232
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,820
evidence and testimonies in advance.
Understood?

233
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,600
Or how do you say

234
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,510
we should put an end to this whole thing?

235
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,080
Enough.

236
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,810
They haven't traced to us now,

237
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,070
but it doesn't mean they won't forever.

238
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,440
We must

239
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,170
extricate ourselves soon.

240
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,600
We can't

241
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,110
let the police find anyone
beyond Qian Yuhong.

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,150
Rest assured, Mr. Ma.

243
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,550
I've done proper preparation beforehand.

244
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,520
Bole Finance

245
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,720
is by no means legally

246
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,180
associated with the online gaming company.

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,700
Hao,

248
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
I know you are

249
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,790
somewhat into Qian Yuhong.

250
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,250
But I'm warning you,

251
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,390
don't let your affection for a woman

252
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,250
obstruct our great cause.

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
In this regard, Luo truly outperforms you.

254
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes.

255
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,750
You're right, Mr. Ma.

256
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,960
It was I who founded

257
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,080
the online gaming company for the group.

258
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
It's very secure.

259
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
Once things quiet down,

260
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,740
I can start over anytime.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
I do appreciate that perspective of yours.

262
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,970
Luo Bo,

263
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
you should really

264
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,870
learn from Hao about certain things.

265
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,510
Got it?

266
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,000
Mr. Ma,

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,270
I'm very much flattered.

268
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,360
I've just read a few more books
than others.

269
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,230
Mr. Luo has more

270
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,560
practical experience than I do.

271
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
I should learn from him in this respect.

272
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
No, no, no.

273
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,350
Mr. Song is tremendously...

274
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,480
knowledgeable.

275
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,840
You're just being modest, Mr. Luo.

276
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,750
Take

277
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,120
Larry Page

278
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,490
and Steve Jobs as examples.

279
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,480
They both dropped out
to start their businesses

280
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,390
and became outstanding entrepreneurs
in the end, right?

281
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,870
You're just like them, Mr. Ma.

282
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,870
Heroes could come from all origins.

283
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,100
Well said.

284
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,300
Very well said.

285
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
Keep up the good work.

286
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,760
The future depends on you young people.

287
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,320
Mr. Ma,

288
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,040
I'll take my leave then.

289
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,860
I will meet with Yuhong

290
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,620
and give her

291
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,050
proper instructions.

292
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,630
Okay.

293
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,390
Later on,

294
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,260
have your people

295
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,100
keep an eye on Qian Yuhong.

296
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,600
You need to protect yourself from danger.

297
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,310
Got it?

298
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Got it.

299
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,020
What about Ye Tianyou's nephew?

300
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,390
Rest assured. He's been on the hook.

301
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,720
We just need to pull the fishing rod
at the right time.

302
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm also sourcing a kidney

303
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,100
for Wang Tao's mother.

304
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
When one is found,

305
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,400
I don't believe he'll reject it
and watch his mother die.

306
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
Remember,

307
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,050
the more you know about your rival,

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,700
the higher your chances of winning.

309
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Got it.

310
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,840
Tianye,

311
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,550
I heard

312
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,330
the police raided
the Rainbow Network Company.

313
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,480
But Yuhong

314
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,210
and Song Hao weren't affected.

315
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,550
I believe
Qin Feng will bring them to justice.

316
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,200
But we can't sit back and do nothing.

317
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,130
We must help him.

318
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,840
But Feng said...

319
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Listen to me.

320
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,600
You just stay with Luo Bo

321
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,070
and keep close watch
on Song Hao and Yuhong.

322
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,080
Yes.

323
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
What do you think?

324
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,510
I think it's nice.

325
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,910
The ventilation's good.

326
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,670
More importantly,
sunlight can get through,

327
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,000
right?

328
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,730
Uncle and you can bask in the sun

329
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,840
in the living room or the balcony.

330
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,440
That's cozy,

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,970
isn't it?

332
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,960
Siyuan, this will be your room.

333
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,000
There's even a place for me?

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,390
The apartment also comes with a study.

335
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,990
-Auntie, then I...
-Siyuan!

336
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
Mr. Song.

337
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,600
Why are you still calling me Mr. Song?

338
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,240
Didn't I tell you

339
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
to call me Hao?

340
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
Sure. Hao.

341
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,790
What are you doing here?

342
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,990
Addressing an issue.

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,250
Who's this lady?

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,870
Allow me to introduce

345
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,670
my aunt to you.

346
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,150
This is Song Hao,

347
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
an enterpreneur.

348
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,450
Let's sit and talk.

349
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,840
Well,

350
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,120
do you...

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,550
also own

352
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,200
this development?

353
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,790
No.

354
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,030
This project belongs to Jinding.

355
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,690
My company has invested in it.

356
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,790
I have to say

357
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,200
these apartments are really nice.

358
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,510
I agree.

359
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,370
Right, Auntie?

360
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,720
Look,

361
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,640
my aunt is thinking about

362
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
buying an apartment

363
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,510
for better living conditions.

364
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,510
You see,

365
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,570
my uncle is about to

366
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,480
retire.

367
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,430
The two of them would like

368
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,680
a comfortable abode for their old age.

369
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,730
But the problem is...

370
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,390
The price is a bit too high.

371
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,250
That's easy to fix.

372
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm friends with the sales manager.

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,480
Ma'am,

374
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,720
with my help,

375
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
you'll get a 30% discount if you put down

376
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,890
a deposit today.

377
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,420
Auntie, what do you think?

378

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,080
will save me much money.

381
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,550
Indeed.

382
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,360
How about...

Maybe

I should discuss it with your uncle first.

Laugh at me if you want.

387
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,870
To be frank, your uncle

388
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,530

389

Let me ask you.

442
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,750
Have you been

443
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,790
hanging out with Luo Bo and Song Hao a lot

444
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,640
recently?

I'm asking
if you've been hanging out with them.

When I studied abroad,
a schoolmate of mine

449
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,310
happened to know Song Hao.

450
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,510
He was then introduced to me over a meal.

451
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,940
I'm not close with him.

452
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,370

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,730
No.

454
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,530
We just had a meal together.

455
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,880
There were many other guests.

456
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,210
I barely got to know him.

457
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,110

No, I haven't.

from now on,

465
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,240

567
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,940
often take place.

568
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,790
But judging from

569
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,790
how brazen and bold they've become,

570
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
when you leave the Public Security Bureau,

571
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,790
I'm not sure what will happen to you.

572
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,320
Now, I'll ask you again.

573
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,720
In the Rainbow Network Co., Ltd.,

574
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,830
exactly what position do you hold,

575
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,830
and what do you do?

576
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Actually, I...

577
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,790
don't know how...

578
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,350
Zhong.

579
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,590
Here are the files
on that online gaming company.

580
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,960
See if they're useful to you.

581
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,730
Director Peng.

582
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,590
Director Peng.

583
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,520
Let me take them.

584
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,120
[Archives]

585
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,930
Here you are.

586
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,230
I spent much effort
attaining this bracelet

587
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,430
from Master Jingxin.

588
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,910
Who on earth are you giving it to?

589
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,560
A friend in the police force.

590
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,320
He loves trinkets alike.

591
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,840
Qian Yuhong,

592
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,810
Remaining silent won't make the problem

593
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,920
go away.

594
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,650
We will eventually figure out

595
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,640
all financial transactions

596
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,000
and track down the funds

597
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,010
wired from the Rainbow Network Company.

598
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,360
No matter
how tight your criminal network is,

599
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,470
there must be weak spots.

600
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,470
Officer,

601
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,030
I'd like to reiterate

602
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,080
that I've never heard about
this network company

603
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,410
you just mentioned.

604
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,020
Also,

605
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,790
I don't know any of the people

606
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,960
you asked me about.

607
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,790
If you have any evidence,

608
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,680
arrest me right now.

609
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,480
If not...

610
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,460
let me go, as I'm very busy these days.

611
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,290
Do you have any other question?

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,720
This is odd.

613
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
I could tell
she was about to confess just now.

614
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,410
Why suddenly...

615
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,620
Find out her parents' address.

616
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,160
Qian Yuhong

617
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,750
was just brought
to the Public Security Bureau.

618
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,590
Qin Feng

619
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,850
nearly broke her down.

620
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,200
This woman

621
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,230
must be eliminated soon.

622
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,880
Got it.

623
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm sorry, sir,

624
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,840
for causing you trouble.

625
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,920
The two of you, go catch

626
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,440
Qian Yuhong's father and brother.

627
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,240
What's wrong, Bo?

628
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,070
Do as I say!

629
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,270
Yes!

630
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,590
Call Song Hao.

631
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,260
Have him come over.

632
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,210
Yes, Mr. Luo.

633
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,160
Let go of me!

634
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,470
What is this for?

635
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Hands off!

636
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,350
Move it!

637
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,960
Let me go!

638
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
Let go of my son!

639
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,340
Let go of my son!

640
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,400
Let go of my son!

641
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,480
Let go of me!

642
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,110
Hands off my son!

643
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,720
Freeze!

644
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,940
Leave my son alone!

645
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,550
Let me go!

646
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,410
Let go of my son!

647
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,670
Stay down!

648
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,070
Don't move!

649
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,730
Let go of me!

650
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,750
We're police. Don't be afraid.

651
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,810
You're Qian Yuhong's family, right?

652
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,790
Mr. Ma,

653
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,960
what happened?

654
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,020
What did Yuhong do?

655
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,810
She planned to flee

656
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,790
After she made a deposit with a bank,

657
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,070
Qin Feng took her
to the Public Security Bureau.

658
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,200
She nearly confessed.

659
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,350
That's impossible.
Why would she try to flee?

660
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,150
I'll call her.

661
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,990
I took every precaution,

662
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,350
including sending people to her home.

663
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,200
But her family were taken away
by Qin Feng in the end.

664
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,150
Now, her entire family

665
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,810
has completely disappeared.

666
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,690
If Qian Yuhong
wasn't cooperating with the police,

667
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,180
why would the police protect her family?

668
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,310
Mr. Ma,

669
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,790
could it be a misunderstanding?

670
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,920
Everyone should clean up his own mess.

671
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,560
Qian Yuhong is your aide.

672
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,750
Mr. Ma,

673
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,350
things haven't gotten this serious, right?

674
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,590
Besides, the police
are keeping close watch on us.

675
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,920
If anything goes wrong,

676
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,970
you'll be implicated, won't you?

677
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,630
Is that so?

678
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,080
You're still reluctant
to make a real effort.

679
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,110
Mr. Ma.

680
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,510
Mr. Ma.

681
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,400
You take care of this matter

682
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,730
regarding Qian Yuhong.

683
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,750
Where is Qian Yuhong?

684
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,480
I don't know.

685
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,670
Lin,

686
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,020
He says he doesn't know.

687
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,200
What do you mean?

688
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,730
I'll ask you one more time.

689
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,360
Where is Qian Yuhong?

690
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,020
Guanlan Residence.

691
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,150
Mr. Ma,

692
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,940
I'll talk to her.

693
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,060
I promise she'll keep her mouth shut!

694
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,200
Lin, go with him.

695
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,110
Dad.

696
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,310
Yuhong,

697
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,290
where are you?

698
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm home. What's wrong?

699
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,950
Have you

700
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,660
got in any trouble lately?

701
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,870
This afternoon,

702
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,240
some people came to our home

703
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,040
and nearly

704
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,610
kidnapped your brother.

705
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,310
Fortunately,

706
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,110
two officers came to our rescue.

707
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
You're saying
two police officers came to your rescue?

708
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,280
That's right.

709
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,580
They were Officer Qin and Officer Wang.

710
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,320
We're

711
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,150
with them right now.

712
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
Oh, right. Yuhong, wait a second.

713
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,510
Officer Qin wants a word with you.

714
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,760
Officer Qin.

715
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,170
Qian Yuhong,

716
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,090
where are my family?

717
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,220
They're at the police station now,

718
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,260
safe and sound.

719
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,770
Don't worry about them.

720
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,830
Thank you, Officer Qin.

721
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,760
You're welcome.

722
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,710
I'm only fulfilling my duty.

723
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,330
Please leave me alone, Officer Qin.

724
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,400
I really can't afford to cross those guys.

725
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,540
Qian Yuhong,

726
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,820
I'll say this to you again.

727
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,000
Even if you take the fall for them,

728
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,810
they still won't let you off the hook.

729
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,990
In other words,

730
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,720
though I've brought your family here
today,

731
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,160
there's no way they can

732
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
stay in the police station forever.

733
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,260
You get that, don't you?

734
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,200
But what if I tell you

735
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,110
their claws have reached you?

736
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,280
What do you mean?

737
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,830
Previously, in the Public Security Bureau,

738
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,350
the officer seated next to you

739
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,210
could be a mole.

740
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,510
He wore a bracelet

741
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,260
that was a gift from me.

742
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,100
Who do you mean?

743
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,410
I'm sorry, Officer Qin.

744
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,960
I don't want to go to prison.

745
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,000
Anything wrong?

746
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,970
What did she say?

747
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,590
Nothing much.

748
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,250
I'll go make a report

749
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,920
to the captain.

750
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
Take them...

751
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,930
to the bureau later.

752
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,610
Officer Wang,

753
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
is Yuhong in trouble or what?

754
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,120
Mr. Qian, take it easy.

755
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
The matter is under investigation.

[Incoming call: Luo Bo]

757
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,600
Chief Zhang, I need to take this call.

758
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,920
Okay. Go ahead.

759
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,280
What do you want?

760
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,350
Tao,

761
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,340
I've waited a long time
for a call from you.

762
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,450
I heard
you guys took Yuhong's family away.

763
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,810
That was quick.

764
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,700
Stop harassing me.

765
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,240
Listen,

766
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,670
you won't get away this time.

767
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,200
That had better not happen.

768
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,170
Should I get in trouble,

769

how can your mother
receive a kidney transplant?

770
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,300
I've found a kidney for her.

771
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,280
Will you take it?

772
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,810

to me,

774
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,740
and I'll arrange a surgery
for your mother right away.

775
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,000
A suitable kidney is really hard to find.

776
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,680
Give some serious thought to my offer.

They're tasty.

Let me try.

781
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,570

816

What is it with you? Say something!

817
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,610
Why are you all here?

818

they know the truth now?

820
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,810
Why didn't you discuss this with us first?

821
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,700
Involving Fei in this

822
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,210
is putting him in danger!

823
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,780
It's fine. I'm not afraid.

I have no choice now.

829
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,830
Since we're on the same boat,

830
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,090
I might as well be honest with you.

831
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,860
Stop being mad.

832
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,310
What's the situation now?

00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,070
Look at that place with the light on.

834
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,710
Song Hao has been up there for a while.

835
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,720
I guess

836
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,940
Yuhong is in there.

837
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,360

841
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,170
how about...

00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,670

843
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,010
Not after an observation.

844
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,100
I don't think she's been here.

845
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
Does she have any other dwelling place?

846
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,440
She has several more properties
in Hanzhou.

847
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,170
We'll check them out one by one.

848

Tianye,

849
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,220
shall we go after them?

850
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,090
Let's go up and take a look.

851
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,150

00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,850
What a waste of effort.

853
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,290
Isn't this a wild goose chase?

854
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,880
What was that about?

855
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
You startled me!

856
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,000
Is this authentic or fake?

857

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,640
