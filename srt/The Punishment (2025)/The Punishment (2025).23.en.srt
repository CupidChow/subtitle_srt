Well,

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,640
since I didn't sell any,
I figured I'd give them to you.

I'll hand them out to everyone.

Will I get reimbursed?

19

I'll pay for them.

Are they easy to carry?

30

These two could still be raised
for a while; they'd even lay eggs.

31

No need. They're going straight
into the pot at noon.

There are indeed issues
with Chengjian Group's cash flow.

In addition, our investigation

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,310
shows that Qiao Defu

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,770
Let's go somewhere crowded

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,370
to shake off this bad luck.

191
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,520
Then let's go eat.

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,460
I've already made a reservation.

193
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,930
Which restaurant?

194
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,760
The one we usually go to,

195
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,550
Zhuyuan.

196
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,000
Alright.

197
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,020
What's wrong?

198
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
Bro,

199
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,320
that was dangerous;
you almost rear‑ended me.

200
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,150
Let's find a place.

201
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,020
Someone wants to have a word with you.

202
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,750
Bro,

203
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,080
I've already come to terms with your boss.

204
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,150
If you keep acting like a thug,

205
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,720
I swear I'll shoot you dead.

206
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,580
Bro!

207
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,280
Calm down.

208
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,280
Take it easy.

209
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,790
Take it easy.

210
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,040
We can talk this out.

211
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,710
Who are you to him?

212
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,790
She's your sister-in-law.

213
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,180
Bro,

214
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,730
she's my wife.

215
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,860
Sis,

216
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,960
I need to talk to your husband somewhere.

217
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
He'll be back after our talk.

218
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Don't tell anyone about this.

219
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,750
Do you understand?

220
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,220
Don't make trouble for him.

221
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,280
You talk to her.

222
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
If the police ask...

223
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
Who's asking?

224
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,720
Well,

225
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,030
no matter who asks,

226
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,630
just tell them that I went...

227
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,910
Just say I didn't come home.

228
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,370
Got it? Don't make trouble.

229
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,890
You're good at passing messages.

230
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,670
Bro,

231
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,810
what's going on?

232
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,290
I don't quite understand what's happening.

233
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,790
He just got out
and already met this much trouble.

234
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,310
Mr. Qiao's got a lot of enemies, huh?

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,790
Are we still getting involved?

236
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,190
When you're in this life,

237
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,500
loyalty is what matters.

238
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Yeah, but they still haven't paid
us the final amount.

239
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
That's right.

240
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,440
Keep some distance. Follow them—

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
and see where they are going.

242
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,670
Where's he taking us?

243
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,880
Can we even get back?

244
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
Relax, bro. I know the way.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,130
He's right up ahead.

246
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,270
[The world is vast. Let's go explore it.]

247
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,600
What should we do, Big Bro?

248
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,860
Should we look around?

249
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,140
Let's bail.

250
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,970
They've got shotguns.

251
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,200
[The world is vast. Let's go explore it.]

252
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,530
This village isn't big.

253
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,470
Not many places to hide here.

254
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,360
Let's go back and get some weapons

255
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,010
and then return.

256
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,630
[The world is vast. Let's go explore it.]

257
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,120
Okay.

258
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,200
Mr. Qiao,

259
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,910
when you cheated us out of our money,

260
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,040
did you ever think this day would come?

261
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,180
Liu Tianye,

262
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,520
what exactly do you want?

263
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,120
Your project.

264
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,500
Your money.

265
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,610
You have what I want.

266
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,720
Pushing your luck, huh?

267
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,070
Go tell Zhang Xin—

268
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,200
should I get in trouble,

269
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,900
you're all going down with me.

270
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
It has nothing to do with Zhang Xin.

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
It was my own idea.

272
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,550
Now you're

273
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,790
just a chip I'm playing at the table.

274
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,750
I have no money.

275
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,270
My life

276
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is not for taking.

277
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,070
If you dare touch me,

278
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,390
we'll go to hell together.

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,080
Who's going to hell with you?

280
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,320
Do you even know

281
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,250
that you scammed Longwan's money?

282
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,170
Keep an eye on him

283
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
these next couple of days.

284
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't let him die.

285
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,800
But don't let him live
too comfortably either.

286
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,160
Everything about Mr. Bao

287
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,210
has been taken care of.

288
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't worry;

289
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,750
no one will find him.

290
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,750
I'll remember you.

291
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,150
When did you find out?

292
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,440
This morning.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,080
We were supposed to notify Qiao Defu

294
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,670
to come in for a routine inquiry,

295
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,390
but we

296
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,680
couldn't reach him.

297
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
We checked the company and his home—

298
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,170
no one knows where he is.

299
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,320
Could it be...

300
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,090
Could someone have leaked the information—

301
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,720
knowing ECID
already had part of the evidence,

302
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,720
so he

303
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
ran ahead of time?

304
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,330
We checked the immigration records.

305
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,150
There's no information on him.

306
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,360
Is there another possibility

307
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
that Qiao Defu has another identity?

308
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,030
That's definitely worth considering.

309
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,360
Qiao Defu likely prepared for a situation

310
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,210
like this well in advance.

311
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,120
There's another possibility.

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
People in Changwu say

313
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,220
Qiao Defu had a conflict with He Biao,

314
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,200
so

315
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,330
we can't rule out retaliation.

316
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,150
If that's the case,

317
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,280
the list of suspects gets a lot longer.

318
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,950
After the mass incident,

319
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,420
a lot of people

320
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,060
held grudges against him.

321
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,600
Peng,

322
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,470
report the situation

323
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,750
to the city authorities.

324
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,270
Yes.

325
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,440
Yan,

326
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
your team continues investigating
Chengjian Group.

327
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,130
Captain Zhong,

328
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,510
aside from locating him,

329
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,190
coordinate with Public Security.

330
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,200
Qiao Defu's disappearance
won't stay hidden.

331
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,550
Pay close attention to

332
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,740
the victims from the mass incident,

333
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,120
so they don't take extreme actions.

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,720
Yes.

335
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,910
Muzhi,

336
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,720
everyone has been sent out,

337
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,180
and there is still no news.

338
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,870
We went soft at the start.

339
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,670
If we'd gone all in early on,

340
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,400
this would've been done by now.

341
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,960
Qiao Defu is right in the eye
of the storm right now.

342
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,440
Anyone who touches him
is asking for trouble.

343
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,840
The police are watching.

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,170
Send someone

345
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,510
to keep an eye on Longwan.

346
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,960
We'll play a round with Liu Tianye.

347
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,670
What about Zhang Xin?

348
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,670
Do we need to
arrange something in advance?

349
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,200
What's there to explain to Zhang Xin?

350
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Just get what she asked for done.

351
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Where could Su have run off to?

352
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,440
I can't reach him now anyway.

353
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,580
He didn't go to Jiu's place

354
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,970
or the pawnshop.

355
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,600
After we had drinks that day,

356
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
he ditched me.

357
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,750
Those bastards from Changwu

358
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,630
have been tailing
Qiao Defu this whole time, right?

359
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,890
They know, don't they?

360
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,240
I'll make a call.

361
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,920
Bro,

362
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,339
where have you been making money?

363
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
Making money?

364
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,200
You cut off our income.

365
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,550
You should be asking
where I'm eating dirt.

366
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,210
Hey, can't you talk properly?

367
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,960
If you can talk properly,
we can have a nice chat.

368
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,620
If not, we'll have to settle this
with our fists.

369
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,720
Tell Su,

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm sending him to meet the King of Hell.

371
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,650
Did you hear me?

372
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,310
After him, you're next.

373
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,500
That's what I said.

374
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,550
Oh please—your words?

375
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,640
You're sending this,

376
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,240
sending that.

377
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,100
What are you, a delivery service?

378
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,190
I know what happened on your end.

379
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,240
Your boss got arrested, right?

380
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,980
Let me tell you, I'm in trouble too.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,960
Su dumped me. You know?

382
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,320
I don't know why he did this.

383
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,880
So whatever happens to him
has nothing to do with me.

384
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm still fuming with anger.

385
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,830
Listen, buddy.

386
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,480
Let's team up

387
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,760
to deal with Su.

388
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,790
What do you think?

389
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,440
You think I'd believe that?

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,720
You two are thick as thieves.

391
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,420
What,

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,800
you set the trap
and expect us to walk right into it?

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,620
I'm not lying to you.

394
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,510
I'm telling you, Su is so disloyal.

395
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,010
He put both Mai and me in serious trouble.

396
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,200
So I figured,
why not just get rid of him altogether?

397
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's team up.

398
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,050
How about it?

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,930
What do you mean?

400
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,970
Tell me more.

401
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,600
It's such a juicy opportunity.

402
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,900
Why let others profit from it?

403
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,640
Right?

404
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,160
We team up to kill Su Hongbao,

405
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,640
and split

406
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,110
whatever's left—

407
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,040
right?

408
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
You've seen what we're capable of.

409
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,170
Someone like Su Hongbao

410
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,370
is easy to deal with.

411
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:51,900
Alright?

412
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,830
Big Bro,

413
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,240
that's a great idea.

414
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,730
They're armed;

415
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,650
it won't be easy to handle them.

416
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,390
They just...

417
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,560
Everyone handles their own business.

418
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,400
Enough talking.

419
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm hanging up.

420
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,560
He hung up.

421
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,770
They must know where Su Hongbao is.

422
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,830
There may be an opening here.

423
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,890
Let's wait and see.

424
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,810
Don't talk nonsense.

425
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,090
They can't be up to any good.

426
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,790
Big Bro,

427
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,880
what they're saying does make some sense.

428
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
If there's money to be made,
why pass it up?

429
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,700
Let's kill Su Hongbao.

430
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,590
They're armed, though.

431
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,180
Why be afraid of that?

432
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,480
If we're going to do it, we do it.

433
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,010
We can't keep scraping by
on day jobs forever.

434
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,270
If anything's going to be done,

435
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,060
we do it ourselves.

436
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Come on; what are you trying to pull?

437
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,610
There's profit in it
and you don't bring us in?

438
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,810
And you still call me—

439
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
what was the point of that call?

440
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,540
I know exactly what you're planning.

441
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,260
Let me give you a word of advice:

442
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,550
don't dig into things you shouldn't.

443
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,030
We can handle our own boss

444
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,310
ourselves.

445
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,100
But

446
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,940
we've eaten,

447
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,670
had drinks together—

448
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,210
that makes us brothers.

449
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,900
I can bring your local crew

450
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,460
in to make some money,

451
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,680
but you'll need to do me a favor.

452
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,910
Get to the point.

453
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,190
I want a gun.

454
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,560
Do you have a connection?

455
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,080
Plenty. Can you pay up?

456
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,610
Don't waste time.

457
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,630
Just tell me if you have it or not.

458
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,350
Get the money ready.

459
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,010
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

460
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,590
He hung up without a word.

461
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,600
What a pain.

462
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,680
Do you think Wen Bo can find this place?

463
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,080
He definitely can.
I sent him the location.

464
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,890
Alright, I'll call him.

465
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,240
No need.

466
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,700
He's here. I'll get the door.

467
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,560
Okay, I'll bring the dishes over.

468
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,290
Are you having hotpot?

469
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,380
It smells good.

470
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,170
Something this nice,
and you didn't invite me?

471
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:19,840
Xiaomei!

472
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,940
He Gang, don't push me too far!

473
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,470
I'll trade my life for yours if I have to.

474
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm not afraid of you!

475
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,070
A pure-love heroine, huh.

476
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,660
He Gang, if you touch Xiaomei again,

477
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,810
I'll take your life!

478
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,930

to a little wolf in seconds.

479
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm so scared.

480
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,680
Say one more word!

481
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,070
Come on.

482
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,110
It's fine.

483
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,000
I've got plenty of time to play with you.

-Police!
-Come on.

485

Put the knife down first.

486
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,270
Put it down.

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,930
What are you all doing here?

488
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,310
Officer,

489
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,040
are you working a case,
or is this just a personal question?

490
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,930
If it's not an official matter,
I'll be on my way.

491
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,660
I haven't done anything wrong.

492
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,420
Kid, let me tell you,

493
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,450
this isn't over between us.

494
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,210
Split up and search!

495
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,870

Mentor,

497
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,280
He Gang's men are searching everywhere
for Su Hongbao.

498
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,190
Are you sure?

499
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,730
We're ready to follow them.

500
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,940
Mentor,

501
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,970
Su Hongbao is one of theirs.

502
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,340
If Su Hongbao kidnapped Qiao Defu,

503
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,880
why would they be looking for him?

504
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,940
An internal split?

505
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,470
They're having an internal split?

506
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,590
If Qiao Defu isn't in He Biao's hands,

507
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,950
then who else could have him?

508
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,150
Don't alert them yet.

509

Come back first.

00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,780
I'll contact our people in Changwu
to check things out.

511
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,750

512
