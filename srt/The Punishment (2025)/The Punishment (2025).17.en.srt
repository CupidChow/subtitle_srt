190
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,030
Thanks.

191
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,510
Mr. He,

192
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,150
Gang has been kidnapped!

193
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,670
Where is Gang?

194
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,350
He's gone.

195
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,960
Gone?

196
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,510
There was an explosion,

197
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,840
with smoke everywhere.

198
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,320
Then Gang was just gone after the blast.

199
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,510
Wait, is he dead or just missing?

200
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,650
Missing.

201
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,210
Missing? Gone?

202
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,000
Mentor,

203
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,610
I saw Second Uncle's car outside.

204
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,790
You go ahead with your work.

205
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,240
Okay.

206
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Is he in the car?

207
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,480
Mr. He!

208
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,000
Mr. He!

209
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,650
Qin Feng is here.

210
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,960
Qin Feng?

211
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes.

212
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,720
Mr. He.

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,970
Captain Qin.

214
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,120
Long time no see.

215
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,870
I happened to be passing by
and thought I'd drop in.

216
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,000
Hope I'm not interrupting.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,890
I'm fine.

218
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,510
I just write a bit

219
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,270
every day

220
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,290
to pass the time.

221
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,230
On my way over,

222
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,770
I passed by your place.

223
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,030
Did it look like there was

224
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,480
either a fire or an explosion?

225
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,140
I saw a crowd gathered around.

226
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,790
No.

227
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,260
No.

228
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,510
Just kids set off fireworks.

229
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,870
You really shouldn't
joke about things like that.

230
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,550
Mr. He,

231
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,750
fire safety

232
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,870
is something you absolutely
have to take seriously,

233
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,440
right?

234
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,270
Especially at entertainment
venues like yours.

235
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,630
You don't want negligence

236
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,960
on your end creating risks for the public.

237
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,720
Am I right?

238
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,320
I've got contacts in the fire department.

239
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,200
I could ask them
to do an inspection for you.

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,750
No need.

241
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,670
No need.

242
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,480
Thank you.

243
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,870
Mr. He,

244
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
I haven't seen your brother around.

245
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,470
Gang is always running all over the place.

246
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,130
Who knows where he's drinking right now.

247
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,810
You've met him, right?

248
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,200
Who is this?

249
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,870
Wen Bo,

250
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Jiangyong's son.

251
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,120
Jiangyong's son?

252
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,720
Yes.

253
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,670
Hello.

254
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,800
This is Mr. Biao.

255
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
In Hanzhou,

256
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,030
a lot of matters require his support,

257
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,760
understand?

258
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,240
I'm He Muzhi,

259
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,630
just call me Muzhi.

260
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,580
Get in touch with Gang.

261
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,910
I don't contact him anymore.

262
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,840
I have no reason to reach out to him.

263
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,620
Why not give him a call?

264
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,640
We need to talk to him.

265
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,670
No answer.

266
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,480
He's probably drunk somewhere.

267
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,680
Try again.

268
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,950
There's still no answer.

269
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,110
This guy…

270
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,880
We're looking for him and can't find him,

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,240
and now even his own brother's calls
are going unanswered.

272
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,370
How irresponsible.

273
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,480
Young man,

274
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
step outside.

275
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,110
Look how anxious Mr. Biao is.

276
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,230
You're afraid no one will pick up,

277
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,320
yet also afraid someone else might answer.

278
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,350
Don't worry.

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,120
We'll help you find him.

280
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,010
No need.

281
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,030
Thanks.

282
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,920
Please don't trouble yourself.

283
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,960
No trouble at all.

284
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,760
You can file a report right here,

285
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,680
right now.

286
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,000
I really don't need to. Thanks.

287
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,550
Alright then.

288
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,070
Mr. He doesn't seem

289
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,950
to be in a good mood today.

290
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,560
We won't bother you anymore.

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,750
Let's go.

292
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,580
We're leaving.

293
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,450
Aren't you going to see me out?

294
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
If you have trouble, call the police.

295
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Don't shoulder it alone.

296
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,240
There's no need.

297
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,080
Please don't get up, Mr. He.

298
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,040
Call me if you need anything.

299
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,980
Qin Feng,

300
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,070
you really can sniff things out.

301
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,610
Send all

302
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,440
our people out.

303
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,720
Find Gang for me.

304
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,550
Find out who did this!

305
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,680
Yes.

306
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,780
Go now!

307
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,680
Yes.

308
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,700
What are you two doing?

309
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,270
Give me back my stool.

310
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,410
Sit down.

311
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,480
What's going on here?

312
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,090
What's going on today?

313
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,240
Why did you go to Grand Paradise?

314
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,590
It's just the three of us today.

315
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,550
Tell us the truth.

316
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,240
Don't lie.

317
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
What are you doing?
I was about to tell him.

318
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,750
A classmate of mine
ran into some trouble today,

319
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,480
so I went to lend her some money.

320
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,920
Classmate?

321
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,890
Male or female?

322
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,880
Female.

323
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,370
Zhou Sisi.

324
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,810
She was my deskmate.

325
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,890
You know her,

326
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,070
the tall one.

327
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,860
Zhou Sisi.

328
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,000
How is she doing lately?

329
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,790
Not so well.

330
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,790
What happened to her?

331
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,500
She...

332
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,100
She's married.

333
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,760
Stop beating around the bush.

334
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,030
Have you been in touch recently?

335
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,430
I haven't contacted her.

336
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,510
She reached out to me.

337
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm not finished explaining.

338
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,200
She married a guy who's a gambling addict,

339
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,530
and he ran off
after racking up a huge debt.

340
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
Then the debt collectors came to

341
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,480
her place and
practically wrecked the shop.

342
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,200
That's when she borrowed money from me.

343
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
So she borrowed from you?

344
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,090
Does your wife know?

345
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,840
She doesn't know yet.

346
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,960
Are things okay

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,930
between you two?

348
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,400
We are fine.

349
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,310
And between you and Zhou Sisi?

350
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,910
Of course not! Are you crazy?

351
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,960
You should be careful yourself.

352
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,030
I'm telling you,
if problems come up in your marriage,

353
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,720
no one can help you.

354
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
Impossible.

355
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,790
You better behave yourself.

356
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,440
I'll be keeping an eye on you
for your wife's sake.

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,410
When you

358
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,860
went to

359
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,420
the Grand Paradise today,

360
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,260
did you see He Gang?

361
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,200
I think

362
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,440
he was dragged out by someone.

363
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,150
By whom?

364
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
It was too chaotic; I didn't notice.

365
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,050
Look, the Grand Paradise—

366
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,170
including

367
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,150
He Gang,

368
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,180
He Biao,

369
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,880
and their whole circle—

370
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,750
are not good people.

371
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,480
Their business isn't clean either.

372
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,550
Stay away from them.

373
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,570
Don't worry.

374
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,550
We're family.

375
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,660
I know the score.

376
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,400
The Grand Paradise
never looked legit anyway.

377
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,110
So

378
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,370
you need to be careful.

379
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,810

bought fireworks there,

424
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,480

at the Grand Paradise explosion site.

He ran away?

428
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,580
He's in hiding.

429
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,750
But Wu Si has a boss called Mr. Bao.

just superficial injuries.

00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,550
Hongbao,

568
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,510
it's me,

569
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,440
Lin.

570
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,220
I got your message.

571
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,100
You're out now?

572
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,610
Yes, I'm out.

573
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,110
Where are you?

574
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,670
Any news about Mr. Ma?

575
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,400
Mr. Ma is dead.

576
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,110
I figured as much.

577
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,030
Who did it?

578
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,320
It was He Biao

579
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,040
and a group from Longwan.

580
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,360
So they took over

581
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Mr. Ma's business too?

582
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,590
Hongbao,

583
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,200
it's all over.

584
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,830
Our old brothers
are either dead or finished.

585
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,640
If you still remember
the ties we once had,

586
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,910
please look after those who are left.

587
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,880
Now that you're out,
don't cause any more trouble.

588
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,720
What do you mean?

589
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,380
And don't come looking for me.

590
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,830
Fine.

591
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,190
Fine. Take care of yourself.

592
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,750
Go ahead.

593
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,630
What exactly do you want?

594
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,550
Back then,

595
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,960
we brothers risked our lives for Ma Jin

596
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,460
and got nothing in return.

597
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,130
Didn't you take over his business?

598
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,880
Talk it over with the people

599
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,800
you make decisions with.

600
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,780
How much are you willing to put up?

601
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,510
You're asking for too much.

602
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,170
I've got nothing left to lose,

603
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,400
so what's this talk about asking too much?

604
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,160
Listen,

605
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,720
Biao,

606
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,400
I'll call you again.

607
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,350
Think about it.

608
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,950
You can choose not to answer.

609
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,070
Find time to buy yourself an urn.

610
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,330
You might need it soon.

611
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,070
Who

612
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,410
is this guy, anyway?

613
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,560
He's one of Ma Jin's
most ruthless enforcers.

614
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,790
Back then,

615
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,880
he took the fall for Ma Jin

616
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,680
and got sentenced to many years.

617
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,380
How the hell is he out already?

618
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,590
Your brother's calmer than you.

619
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,930
He can really keep his cool.

620
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,710
Why are you staring at me?

621
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,880
If he wants money,

622
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,680
why don't we negotiate with him?

623
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,030
There's no way this deal
can be negotiated.

624
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,350
First, we get our people back.

625
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,350
How can we negotiate this?

626
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,810
It's unfair to begin with!

627
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,030
And

628
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,410
if we don't settle this properly,

629
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,170
who's going to be calling the shots
in Hanzhou from now on?

630
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,910
He knows way too much about us.

631
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,350
Exactly because he knows so much—

632
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,350
if the cops start watching him,

633
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,240
won't that make things even worse for us?

634
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
Liu Tianye, let me tell you,

635
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,510
I don't care what schemes you had
in mind before;

636
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,790
you can't escape this.

637
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,750
If what happened with Ma Jin gets out,

638
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,280
you and I are both finished.

639
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,380
And every one of your brothers

640
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,400
in Longwan,

641
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,110
Zhao Village—

642
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,520
none of them will make it out alive.

643
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,570
Understood.

644
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,500
Dig into him.

647
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,730
who he's met,

648
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,070
who he's been dealing with.

649
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,360
Get me all the details.

650
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,510
Everyone has a weakness.

651
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,639
The battle has begun.

652
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,449
The underworld is about connections,

653
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,880
but it's also about violence.

654
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,710
When I have news,

655
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
I'll let you know.

656
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,670
Sir,

657
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,760
I miss you. Let's meet.

658
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,590
Tianye, what's wrong?

659
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,050
Tianye,

660
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,800
your head hurts?

661
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,330
What's wrong?
Let me take you to the hospital.

662
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,340
Where's your medicine?

663
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,070
Where did you put it?

664
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,920
Yes, take the medicine first.

665
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,850
Take it quickly.

666
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,800
Look,

667
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,420
you rest now.

668
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,670
We'll go find him.

669
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,030
Yes.

670
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,950
Wait a minute.

671
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Listen to me,

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,730
Su Hongbao

673
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,200
has to be dealt with, no doubt about it.

674
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,880
But there can't be
any more bloodshed, alright?

675
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,320
Then...

676
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
What should we do?

677
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,800
We're getting in deeper and deeper.

678
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,030
If this continues,
it will alert the police.

679
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,150
Su Hongbao isn't exactly an easygoing man.

680
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,510
If things don't go his way,
he could really go through with it.

681
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,630
Wait a minute.

682
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,400
Let me think, okay?

683
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,660
Let me think. It hurts.

684
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,400
Tianye, we're right outside.

685
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,000
Call us if you need anything.

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,230
-Give me a bowl of noodles.
-Okay.

689
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,980
Still the same good taste?

690
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,490
By the way, Hongbao,

691
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,540
recently

692
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,370
some people from the underworld
have been asking about you.

to find me

696
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,610
and left a number,

697
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,130
saying you should call when you see them.

No. I've never seen him.

Why did Su Hongbao kidnap your brother?

He thought my business was doing too well,

717

so he wanted a piece of it.

Stop beating around the bush.

introduce you to the person

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,670
If your brother
hadn't gotten into trouble,

754
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,600
you wouldn't have come to me at all.

755
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
To put it plainly,

756
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,230
if it weren't for the title

757
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,120
of deputy director,

758
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,510
you would probably
pretend not to recognize me

759
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,510
even if you ran into me on the street.

760
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,500
Are you really that eager to
cut all ties with me?

761
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,510
Fine.

762
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,450
If you don't want to talk about feelings,

763
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,410
then let's talk about interests.

764
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,920
If you can help me

765
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,270
get Gang out,

766
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,920
I'll give you whatever you want.

767
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
I'll do whatever you ask.

768
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,170
Stop resorting to these
crooked ways, alright?

769
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,330
Take my advice—

770
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,210
report it to the police.

771
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,630
I can't help you.

772
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,630
If Gang really did something wrong,

773
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,360
will you arrest him?

774
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,320
If he really did something wrong,
I will definitely arrest him.

775
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,050
Not just him,

776
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,150
even if it were you,

777
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,190
if you break the law,

778
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,020
I'll arrest you just the same.

779
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,840
Believe it or not?

780
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,700
Peng Hanzhang!

781
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,510
If you're going to be so cold to me today,

782
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,710
don't blame me for turning against you.

783
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,550
I'm laying it out right now.

784
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,310
If you don't help me with this,

785
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,590
I'll report you immediately,

786
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,590
under my real name!
