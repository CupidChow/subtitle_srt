00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,240
It's fine.

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,750
Let's play a bit longer.

193
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,010
Really, it's nothing.

194
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,290
As long as everything's okay.

195
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Hurry up. Squat here.

196
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Behave yourself.

197
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,200
Come on,

198
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,880
squat here.

199
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,850
Get down.

200
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,690
Chief Zhang.

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,300
You're injured. Are you alright?

202
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,690
These few put up a fight.

203
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,410
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
Where's Guo Yaoyang?

205
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,390
Hey, you.

206
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,070
Where is Guo Yaoyang?

207
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,730
He climbed over the wall and ran.

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,970
Issue an APB for Guo Yaoyang immediately.

209
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,500
Yes, sir.

210
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,430
Captain Zhong.

211
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,960
In Guo Yaoyang's office,

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,690
we found a large amount of cash.

213
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,790
Everyone stay put and behave.

214
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,010
Captain Zhong.

215
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,160
Didn't expect things to get this big.

216
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,560
Count it and take it back to the bureau.

217
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,130
Yes, sir.

218
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,370
Gentlemen.

219
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,080
How much?

220
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,790
How much?

221
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,550
Okay.

222
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,550
That's great.

223
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,720
Good.

224
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,720
I see.

225
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,030
What's with all the fuss?

226
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,990
Illicit funds were seized at the scene.

227
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,850
How much?

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,290
I don't know.

229
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,670
They said they'd only counted halfway.

230
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,840
They're requisitioning
money-counting machines

231
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,870
from various units.

232
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,600
The machines malfunctioned
when the amount exceeded ten million.

233
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,790
Let me tell you.

234
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,470
In terms of this case,

235
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,600
you two

236
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,550
helped us a lot.

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,390
Thank you.

238
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,270
After the case is over,

239
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,630
I will personally present you
with a commendation banner.

240
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,830
Don't talk nonsense.

241
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,500
This has nothing to do with us.

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,240
What does this have to do with us?

243
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,960
Look.

244
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,510
That's real class.

245

Doing good deeds anonymously.

246
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,080
I'll send it anonymously. Don't worry.

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,270
Alright, we should go.

248
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,460
-They need people over there.
-Let’s go.

249
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,520
You stay seated. No need to see us off.

250
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,950
No need for formalities.

251
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,670
What's wrong?

252
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,970
What's happening?

253
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,740
I told you to keep an eye on him.

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,930
Okay, I know.

255
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,570
What now?

256
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,860
Su Hongbao

257
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,840
is drunk again.

258
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,220
He's causing trouble.

259
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,980
Drunkard.

260
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,320
Drinking so much every day,
isn't he messing up his work?

261
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,550
How can his boss trust him?

262
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,220
Exactly.

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Mr. Biao, we're heading back. Gang.

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,550
See you later.

265
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,480
Don't see us out.

266
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,530
This Qin Feng is like a mad dog.

267
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,630
He's going to be the death of me.
He knows everything.

00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,270
Biao.

269
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,280
Over 10 million,

gone.

271
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,050
Money is the least of our concerns.

272
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,480
Listen,

273
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
you need to tell Yaoyang right now

274
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,040
to hide well.

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,960
Don't let Qin Feng catch him.

276
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,030
Hurry up!

280
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,980
That's him.

281
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:42,870
Ba,

282
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,930
can we talk?

283
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,470
Go ahead.

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
My name is Liu Tianye.

285
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,980
We're from Longwan.

286
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,310
I heard that in

287
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,320
Hanzhou,

288
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,890
if anyone wants to do beef business,

289
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,120
they need

290
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
your approval, Ba.

291
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,240
So today we...

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,320
Specially prepared some

293
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,000
gifts.

294
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,890
With just these gifts,

295
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,690
you come to compete with my business?

296
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,030
Are you dreaming?

297
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,130
Not competing,

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,180
cooperating.

299
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,090
Because I have ships

300
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,480
and enough cargo.

301
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,770
Actually, as long as you agree, Ba,

302
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,300
you can just sit back
and wait for your share.

303
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,730
You're Liu Tianye, right?

304
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,720
Why should I work with you?

305
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,200
I don't care who you are

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,880
or where you came from.

307
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,530
Get the hell out of here.

308
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,080
And you, Mr. Wei,

309
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,310
if I can beat you once,

310
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,350
I can beat you again.

311
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,990
You believe that?

312
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,840
Try it then.

313
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,410
Don't push your luck.

314
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
That beef of yours

315
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,150
didn't come through
legitimate channels either.

316
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,130
Let me tell you,

317
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,360
today we're taking it by force.

318
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
How dare you talk like that?

319
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,010
Are you tired of living?

320
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Bro.

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,920
Let's talk this through.

322
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,440
Let's talk.

323
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,150
Fine.

324
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,120
Someone does want to have a word with you.

325
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,780
Section Chief Qi from the AIC
will call you soon.

326
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,540
You don't want your business
shut down for rectification, do you?

[Welcoming Good Fortune and Prosperity]

328
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,750
Mr. Liu.

329
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,080
Please take care of me in the future.

330
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,570
You're being too polite.

331
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
You said earlier

332
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,630
that you have many ships, right?

333
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,690
What do you have in mind?

334
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,270
The number of ships depends on
how you plan to use them.

335
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,950
It's like this.

336
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,500
Someone introduced me
to a business opportunity before,

337
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,110
but I don't have my own ships,

338
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,880
and my funds are limited.

339
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,630
So,

340
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,660
I haven't dared to take it on.

341
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,130
What kind of business?

342
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
I have a friend

343

who got into trouble before
and fled abroad.

344
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,390
Now he's doing well there

345
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,840
and has strong connections.

346
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,910

That's extremely profitable.

00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,120
Didn't Section Chief Qi say

351
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,250
he has a classmate working in customs?

352
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,660
Ask him to make contact.

353
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,700
Then I'll get back to you.

354
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,089
Okay. I'll make the connections

The leadership will definitely
want to say something to you later.

You need to think carefully

361
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,250
about how to respond to them.

362
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,680
What's there to think about?

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,070
I'll just tell the truth.

364
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,830
This operation
was able to achieve such success

365
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,690
thanks to the leadership of Director Yan

366
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,190

That's how we completed
the mission, right?

368
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,460
Telling the truth is good.

369
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,920
Telling the truth is good.

370
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880

Yes.

375
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,900
Chief Zhang

376
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
really deserves credit.

377
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,680
He led the charge with me

378
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,410
and was the first one to rush in.

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,750
Ma Jin that He Biao mentioned?

757
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,700
Say something!

758
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,720
He's dead.

759
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,830
We did it.

760
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
So now He Biao

761
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,670
doesn't want us to leave the ship,

762
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,840
and we can't.

763
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,640
You guys...

764
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,410
Why?

765
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,610
Why did you do it?

766
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,610
Because Ma Jin got Jiangyong killed,

767
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,410
so we avenged him.

768
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,680
If you want to back out now,

769
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,930
that's fine.

770
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,030
You can stay out

771
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,490
of all He Biao's business.

772
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,730
But the logistics company

773
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,840
is your responsibility.

774
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,980
Tianye.

775
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,900
This isn't the same

776
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,490
as smuggling.

777
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,180
This is about someone's life.

778
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,660
We can't do this anymore.

779
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,200
We all have families.

780
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,429
I'll handle things with He Biao.

781
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,840
Consider my suggestion.

782
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,110
If you want out,

783
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,590
I support you.

784
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,210
Let's...

785
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,050
Let's deal with the body first.

786
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,320
Did you see how Schweinsteiger
played this match?

787
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
Could he even pass the ball
accurately to anyone?

788
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,040
If it were not Schweinsteiger coming on…

789
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,030
Yeah.

790
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,440
What kind of game
was Schweinsteiger playing?

791
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,240
Even that pass got intercepted?

792
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,960
Never reached his feet.

793
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,070
Yes, there was definitely an issue.

794
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,550
Right, if that pass had been on target,

795
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,610
wouldn't the score be different now?

796
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,550
Clean it up.

797
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Fire! Fire! Fire!

798
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,550
Hurry up!

799
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,710
Dad,

800
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,800
you're back.

801
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,800
They are my college classmates.

802
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,360
Everyone's free during the holiday,

803
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
so we got together to watch a game.

804
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,040
Yes.

805
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,760
It's getting late. We should go, right?

806
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,320
Let's go.

807
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,960
Let's go.

808
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,440
Goodbye, sir.

809
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,240
Goodbye, sir.

810
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,190
Dad,

811
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,610
I'm going to bed too.

812
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,960
Wait.

813
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,890
What is it?

814
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,920
Go get me two beers.

815
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,880
You're all grown up now.

816
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,840
No need to hide

817
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,840
the drinking

818
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
and smoking from me anymore.

819
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,360
Just don't fall behind in your studies.

820
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Don't worry, Dad.

821
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,880
Come on,

822
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,920
let's have a drink together.

823
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,050
You'll graduate in a few years.

824
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
Let me know your plans

825
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,440
in advance.

826
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,190
Whether you want to pursue
graduate school or study abroad,

827
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,790
I'll support you either way.

828
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,030
Dad.

829
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,410
Did something happen?

830
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,110
Nothing.

831
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,370
Are you hungry?

832
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,320
I'll make you some noodles,

833
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
and prepare some cold dishes

834
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,960
to go with the drinks.

835
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,150
Okay.

836
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,150
Tianye, do you still have

837
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,850
that blood smell on you?

838
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,280
I feel like that smell

839
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,610
just won't wash off.

840
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,590
Let's not talk about this.

841
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,670
Get some good sleep when you get back.

842
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,330
Don't mention this to anyone.

843
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,000
He Biao is using us.

844
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,490
What are we going to do?

845
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,590
We can't really go around killing people.

846
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,850
He's not just using us.

847
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,670
Right now,

848
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,860
he's putting us between him and Feng.

849
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,760
If anything happens,
he'll throw us under the bus.

850
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,930
I don't want to end up like Guo Yaoyang.

851
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,760
Tianye.

852
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,720
-What are you doing?
-Washing the car.

853
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,690
Where have you been? You're so dirty.

854
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,940
Taoyi,

855
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
what's that on your clothes?

856
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,760
Nothing.

857
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,230
It's blood?

858
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,190
Well,

859
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,390
we were watching a game at the bar,

860
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,630
had some drinks,

861
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,070
got into an argument with someone,

862
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,930
and had a fight.

863
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,710
No one got hurt, right?

864
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,480
No, no.

865
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,450
Fighting over a game?

866
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,800
Jiangyan, don't tell anyone about this.

867
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,930
It's embarrassing.

868
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,360
At least you know it's embarrassing.

869
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,190
Let's wash the car first.

870
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,800
We have things to do tomorrow.

871
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,630
Let's get out of here when we're done.

872
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,590
Are you sure you're okay?

873
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,450
Yeah. I'm okay.

874
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,920
Then I'll go upstairs
to put something away.
