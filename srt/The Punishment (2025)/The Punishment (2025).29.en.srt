they had advance warning.

157
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,170

For the port business,

457
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,400
if we do more promotion online,

458
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
it will definitely attract

459
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,740

we have to seize the opportunity.

462
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,450
For example,

463
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,640
we could get some influencers

464
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,070
to post about the company online

465
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,920
to boost our visibility.

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,660
Once our company's reputation
is out there,

467
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,920
we won't have to

468
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,750
actively look for partners anymore—

469

471

473

476

and for Longwan's benefit.

so

491
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,350

496

Jiangyan's parents passed away
when she was young,

497
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,510
so our whole family raised her with love.

498

You were her classmate;
we know your background.

All we want

500
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,670
is for her to live

501

a steady, happy life.

502
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,000
Don't worry about that, Tianye.

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,160
I will always treat Jiangyan well
for my whole life.

But you didn't understand what I meant.

505

What I mean is

506
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,550
that as long as

507
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,040

they caused you.

he'll show himself sooner or later.

And once he does,

579

I'll catch him—
even if it takes my whole life.

934
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,320
We'll set up a special investigation team.

935
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,720
I'll personally lead it,

936
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,630
with Mayor Hong as deputy.

937
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,910
The project stops immediately—
full-scale investigation.

938
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,360
What about Xinrui?

939
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,670
Shouldn't that be looked into as well?

940
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,480
Of course.

941
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,320
And it'll be investigated thoroughly.

942
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,180
No exceptions.

943
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,850
Have a seat.

944
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,210
Mayor Hong,

945
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,360
do you have issues

946
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,030
with our Public Security Bureau's work?

947
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,820
If you have any concerns,
please speak directly.

948
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,550
Ye,

949
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,120
this construction accident

950
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,960
has me completely overwhelmed.

951
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,190
You have to understand

952
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,590
I'm just an acting mayor.

953
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,250
Just that word "acting"

954
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,450
makes things so difficult for me.

955
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,540
We identify problems and solve them.

956
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,360
Isn't this meeting today

957
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
precisely to solve these problems?

958
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,110
Ye,

959
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,760
tell me honestly,

960
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,910
how's the investigation

961
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,500
into Liu Yi's case going?
