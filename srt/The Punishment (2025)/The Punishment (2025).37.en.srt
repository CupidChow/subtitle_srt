00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,080
First, freeze the funds.

380
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,420
Then make the arrests.

381
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
All these years,

382
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,680
the one managing his accounts
is Zhou Sisi.

383
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,110
She's involved
in plenty of money laundering.

384
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,960
Just for that,

385
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,280
I can arrest her.

386
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,400
I'll coordinate this matter.

387
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
I'll try to give you more leeway.

388
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,550
Sir,

389
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,680
now both the task force and the city

390
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,400
are investigating Chen Shuifa

391
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
and Xinrui Group.

392
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,510
Um...

393
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,960
is Zhang Xin...

394
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,050
What's the situation like in the bureau?

395
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,980
Everything is normal.

396
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,750
Is Guazi under control?

397
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,840
It should be no problem.

398
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,830
I think

399
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,270
it's under control.

400
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,560
[Get Strong, Stay Fit]

401
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,920
As long as this man keeps his mouth shut,

402
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,310
Zhang Xin will be fine.

403
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,370
No need to worry.

404
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,590
Besides,

405
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,880
I've started maneuvering
at the provincial level.

406
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,070
The task force
won't be around for many more days.

407
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,680
Also,

408
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,270
although you're currently
the acting director,

409
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,330
with my support for your work,
you should be confident.

410
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,070
Of course.

411
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,750
Ye Tianyou has retired,

412
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,800
but his influence remains.

413
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,360
For you to carry out your work smoothly,

414
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,160
the key positions

415
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,720
must be in your own hands.

416
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,960
Use your own people.

417
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,290
It has to be a solid, unbreakable unit.

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,160
I understand.

419
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,770
Go back and tell them

420
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,440
they must unify their thinking.

421
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,350
By the way,

422
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,350
Sir,

423
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,590
today, I specifically brought
Captain Zhong Yanning

424
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,650
of the Criminal Investigation Unit.

425
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,750
He is a seasoned comrade in our bureau.

426
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,540
He is very capable

427
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,110
and also very eager to advance.

428
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,910
It's just that

429
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,640
he hasn't had the opportunity
all these years.

430
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,500
How about this?

431
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,790
I'll ask him

432
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,490
to report this case to you.

433
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,880
He's waiting next door.

434
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,590
Go.

435
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,070
Zhong.

436
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,920
Yes.

437
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,830
Hello, Sir.

438
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm Zhong Yanning.

439
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,640
Xiaomei,

440
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,880
your release on bail pending trial

441
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
was handled by Ms. Leng.

442
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,140
Tell her everything you know.

443
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,970
It will help with your sentence reduction
or probation in the future.

444
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,960
Don't worry.

445
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,130
Take your time.

446
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,160
Tell me what you know.

447
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll help you.

448
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,680
Xiaomei.

449
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,930
I know

450
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,290
this is very hard for you.

451
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,700
You've been in Longwan for so many years.

452
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,100
You're practically
a Longwan person by now.

453
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,990
Ding Baoshuai ending up like this

454
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,270
is something none of us wants to see.

455
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,180
But there are still so many young people
in Longwan.

456
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,530
And our children

457
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,740
will grow up in Longwan.

458
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,190
We can't
let what happened to Ding Baoshuai

459
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,880
happen to them again.

460
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,710
For our children,

461
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
and for yourself,

462
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,570
tell us everything you know.

463
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,050
I just finished eating that day

464
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,660
and thought I'd go out for a walk

465
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,920
and wait for Xiaoshuai while I was at it.

466
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,320
Then I saw them

467
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,940
pushing a man into a room.

468
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,990
So I went to see what was happening.

469
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,420
What are you trying to do?

470
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,430
What did they say?

471
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,290
I couldn't hear very clearly.

472
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,640
I just...

473
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,510
heard bits and pieces,

474
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,220
something about...

475
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,740
a female college student.

476
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,330
She seemed to be someone's mistress.

477
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,840
And she was pregnant.

478
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,350
She was... Ms. Zhang's assistant.

479
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,380
Meng Yu,

480
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,510
help Ms. Wen with her bag.

481
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,110
Okay.

482
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
She is...

483
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,980
She's my new assistant.

484
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,790
Xinrui has those work-study projects

485
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,410
with a few universities.

486
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,680
She is good at foreign languages.

487
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,590
She can work as an interpreter,

488
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,310
so I kept her as my secretary.

489
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,690
Meng Yu, say hello to Ms. Wen.

490
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Hello, Ms. Wen.

491
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,520
Hello. Hello.

492
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,290
Your assistant—

493
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,550
her name is Meng Yu, right?

494
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,150
Why didn't she come with you?

495
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,100
She resigned.

496
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,450
I know this person.

497
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,630
I saw her at the racecourse.

498
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,110
But later I heard she resigned.

499
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,990
Can you get in touch with her?

500
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,160
I don't have her contact information.

501
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,190
But I can think of a way.

502
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,860
Xiaomei,

503
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,640
many years ago,

504
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,880
there was a girl

505
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,490
who was also driven to her death by them.

506
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,880
All these years, we investigators

507
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,340
have been searching
for clues and evidence.

508
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,440
What you told me today

509
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,330
has given me great hope.

510
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,160
Thank you.

511
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,140
They... also mentioned another person.

512
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,590
Mayor Hong.

513
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,280
He seems to be the one behind them.

514
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,440
They also said...

515
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,980
something about holding overseas assets
or something.

516
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,100
Director Ye,

517
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,830
based on the information
provided by Qin Feng,

518
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,270
we have started the investigation.

519
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,960
Luo Xiaomei has also agreed to testify.

520
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,000
The college student named Meng Yu—

521
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,240
have you gotten in touch with her?

522
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,160
It's a little difficult,

523
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
but we are still trying to find a way.

524
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,690
Hong Mushou

525
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,060
has been operating in Hanzhou
for so many years.

526
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,390
He has friends

527
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,070
and social connections.

528
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,930
We are not facing just him alone,

529
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,550
but an interest group of dozens,

530
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,790
even hundreds of people.

531
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,480
If these people fight back,

532
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,270
it will be like a flood of wild beasts,

533
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,460
a towering wave.

534
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,750
At this stage

535
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,180
of the investigation,

536
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,310
every step we take

537
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,720
is like scraping the bone
to heal the wound—

538
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,850
extremely painful,

539
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,170
but absolutely necessary.

540
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:37,760
Ye.

541
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,310
I just got a call.

542
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,540
As soon as Chen Shuifa got into trouble,

543
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,030
Hong Mushou rushed to his mentor's home
in the provincial capital that very night.

544
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,690
The leadership told us
to prepare for the worst.

545
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,410
This might be our last chance.

546
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,960
What do you mean?

547
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,590
The task force...

548
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,130
might be withdrawn at any moment.

549
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,960
We finally managed to uncover these leads.

550
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,270
So many people have investigated
for so many years.

551
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,740
My disciples and I

552
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,510
have risked our lives for this.

553
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,920
We're going to reveal the truth soon.

554
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,450
How can they just withdraw?

555
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,610
The leadership said over the phone

556
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,230
that someone
with very significant influence

557
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,730
spoke up for Hong Mushou.

558
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,030
We are under...

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
a lot of pressure.

560
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,400
No wonder our investigation
has kept hitting roadblocks lately.

561
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,110
Every department paid lip service.

562
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,350
They said all the right things,

563
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,400
but they just wouldn't cooperate with us.

564
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,440
They have extended their hands

565
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,680

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,850
before any of that happens.

753
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,030
Have you found all the people I asked for?

754
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,440
I've arranged everything.

755
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,040
All from Longwan. Reliable.

756
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,590
I also asked people

757
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,050
to keep an eye on our homes.

758
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,840
Taoyi.

759
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,050
Have you made up your mind?

760
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,060
Tianye said he's not leaving.

761
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,880
Then I'm not leaving either.

762
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,710
I plan to turn myself in.
