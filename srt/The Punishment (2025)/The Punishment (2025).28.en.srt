there's a call from the dock.

189
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,030
They say He Biao
is looking for the boat everywhere.

190
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,670
I think

191
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,240
something's not right.

192
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,470
How did they know He Gang was on the boat?

193
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,410
This should be the final round, right?

194
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,640
When will He Biao arrive?

195
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,700
He'll be here soon.

You two get ready.

Do as I say later.

198
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,700
Okay.

199
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,150
He Biao,

200
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
get your ass out here!

Get out here now!

who reported the warehouse, didn't you?

It doesn't matter.

I don't care.

Don't worry.

But let me tell you.

Shut him up!

Don't you think he's a lot like Gang?

220
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,130
Since he doesn't want to leave the table,

221
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,610
let him die with the rest.

222
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,430

that living in a place like this

Captain Zhong.

566
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,140
What happened?

567
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,600
Ding Xiaoshuai

568
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,570
got into a car accident with He Biao.

569
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,930
By the time we arrived,

570
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,440
Ding Xiaoshuai already had no pulse.

571
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,100
He is still in emergency care.

572
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,210
What about Liu Tianye?

573
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,110
We're taking him back to
the bureau to get a statement.

574
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,170
He Biao is dead too?

575
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,780
Let's get back to the bureau first.

576
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,420
[Hanzhou Central Hospital]

577
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,490
Xiaoshuai, you're awake.

578
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,840
How are you feeling?

579
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,250
What about He Biao?

580
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,960
Is he dead?

581
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,120
Ding Xiaoshuai.

582
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,960
We need to ask you a few questions.

583
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,150
Wen Bo,

584
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,480
give us a moment.

585
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,070
Tell me

586
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,770
what happened yesterday.

587
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:39,120
[Ward 5]

588
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,550
He Biao is dead.

589
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,010
He Gang has been taken care of too.

590
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,230
I think

591
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
since the Longwan people
want a seat at the table,

592
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,690
we can keep them.

593
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,760
But we need

594
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,670
our own people with them.
