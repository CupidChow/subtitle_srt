If the development zone
really takes off in the future,

year by year.

The current plan sounds very good.

747
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,110
But in the future,

748
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,110
it will depend on how you implement it.

749
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,110
Got it. Got it.

750
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,110
Qin, how about this?

751
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,150
We'll take Director Chen

752
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,190
to have a look around, okay?

753
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,030
Okay. Director Chen.

754
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,480
-Please.
-Please.

755
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Come, Director Chen.

756
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,450
Everyone, make way!

757
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,110
What does Uncle Limin mean?

758
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,320
Why should we let them in?

759
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,920
Tianfei.

760
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,240
What are you trying to do?

761
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,920
Jiangyong.

762
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,360
Madam Wen,

763
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,150
the land rental contract
was sent to you long ago,

764
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,010
but you wouldn't even discuss it.

765
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,960
Isn't that a bit rude?

766
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,840
We're full of sincerity,

767
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,120
but you lack manners.

768
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,980
I already gave you my reply.

769
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,250
We want to continue to run our farm.

770
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,500
So we won't rent Longwan to you.

771
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,560
A small fishing village
getting such an opportunity

772
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,710
is a blessing from your ancestors.

773
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,230
Madam Wen,

774
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,970
the villagers chose you as their leader.

775
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,520
You can't lead everyone

776
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,750
down a dead-end road.

777
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,570
Longwan's affairs

778
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,000
are up to us, right?

779
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,550
-Yes!
-Yes!

780
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,320
-We decide ourselves!
-We decide ourselves!

781
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,710
Everyone from Longwan, listen carefully.

782
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,110
If you want to negotiate,

783
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,590
you're welcome anytime.

784
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,030
If not...

785
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,190
I'll attend your funeral banquets.

786
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,120
What did you say?

787
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,290
Call the police if you dare!

788
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,630
Don't fight!

789
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,080
Calm down!

790
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,510
Calm down!

791
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Hit me and I'll just lie down.

792
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,590
Calm down!

793
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,030
Quite a temper.

794
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,540
Fighting isn't a good habit.
