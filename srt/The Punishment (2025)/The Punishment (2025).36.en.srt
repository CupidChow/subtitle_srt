00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
This is great.

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,290
Congratulations.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,650
You've finally become a police officer.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,160
Maybe I can ask my dad

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,420
to talk to Uncle Tianye

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,120
about lending you some money
to repeat a year of study.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,760
Forget it.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,510
We're not family.

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,390
It's inappropriate to ask for a favor.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,880
How can you say we're not family?

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,210
We're all from Longwan.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Centuries ago, we were all related.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,790
That's just for your three families,
Wen, Liu, and Qin.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,110
For outsiders like us,

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,110
even if you go back
several thousand years,

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,350
we still wouldn't be related.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,210
You're being too narrow-minded.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,840
If we go back tens of thousands of years,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,300
we all evolved from primates.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,630
So, we're still family.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,800
Honestly,

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,920
I don't want to study anymore.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,780
I'm just not cut out for it anyway.

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
What will you do then?

26
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,970
Make money.

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,760
Just like Uncle Tianye.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,070
I heard he had good grades in school,

29
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,600
but he didn't go to college.

30
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,150
But look at him now.

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,980
He's very successful.

32
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,900
Are you going to start a business?

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,430
I haven't figured out
exactly what to do,

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,070
but I definitely won't spend my whole life
working for someone else.

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,670
I don't want to be like my dad,

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,230
who does the most exhausting work

37
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,360
with the least money

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,360
and is still despised by others.

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,970
One day,

41
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,400
I'll make a name for myself.

42
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,509
I'll be very successful

43
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,240
and prove myself

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
to my dad and all those

45
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,350
who look down on me.

46
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,970
I believe in you.

47
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,000
Really?

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560

A father?

A father knows his son the best?

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,150
Whose father?

53
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,840
Whose?

54

61

Any progress on arresting Zhao Peng?

62
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,079
We've confirmed

63
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,910
that the person who took Zhao Peng away

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,960
is Ding Baoshuai.

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,050
Currently, we're searching for him
in a large scale.

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Although there might be

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,090
more to the story behind it,

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,430
based on what we know so far,

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Zhao Peng

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,090
is likely a key suspect

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,910
and probably even the mastermind.

72
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,310
That's for sure.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
I think

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
maybe we should issue
a preliminary announcement

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,530
to quiet

What do you think?

78
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,470
They've already covered it up once.

79
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,680
Without conclusive verification,

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
it would be reckless
to issue an announcement.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,510
Otherwise,

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,040
the people would lost trust
in the government.

Director Peng,

84
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,600
are there any new leads?

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,600
Not at the moment.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,880

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,000

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,390
I think we should issue an announcement

as soon as we can

92
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,170
to completely stop the rumors

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,820
We can issue an announcement.

But Director Peng,

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,430
your team cannot slack off
on the investigation.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,630

I'll take care of it right away.

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400

Should we reach out to him?

Now that he doesn't want
to answer our calls,

let's knock him out of the game.

Find some videos
of him taking bribes and doing dirty work

133
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,150
and post them online.

134
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,360

This will cause a major stir.

138
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,270
Shouldn't we negotiate with him first?

139
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,750
Do you think an official like him
would negotiate with you?

140
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,040
Contact Editor-in-Chief Zhang.

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,549
considering our current situation,

190
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,080
I don't know how to tell him.

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,840
I've been feeling unwell lately.

192
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,630
And I just threw up.

193
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,410
Where is Liu Tianye?
I need to talk to him.

194
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,340
Li, I'll talk to you later.

195
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,400
Xiaoshuai is back.

196
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,320
What are you doing?

197
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
Director Chen.

198
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,750
Sorry. You didn't answer our calls,

199
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,610
so I had to invite you here to talk.

200
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,690
Liu Tianye,

201
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,670
what do you think you're doing?

202
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,790
[Video Call] [End]

203
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,870
Are you insane?

204
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,410
Hey, there's so much gossip
about the boss.

205
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,020
If you're willing to share it with me,

206
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,290
I might feel better.

207
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,940
Are you going to mess with the boss?

208
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,600
[Video Call] [End]

209
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,830
Listen, Liu Tianye,

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
if you want to die,
don't drag me down with you.

211
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,570
Do you have a death wish?

212
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,120
Maybe I can help you remember.

213
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,550
Ma Jin did some dirty work
for the boss before,

214
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,670
and he had a notebook

215
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,030
with many numbers written in it.

216
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,630
Some are probably digital codes

217
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,440
or

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,870
bank accounts.

219
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,200
There are about 20 sets.

220
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
He had kept this notebook with him
until he died,

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,460
which means it must've been
his last resort.

222
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,630
However,

223
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,030
I read

224
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,120
and looked into it.

225
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
[Video Call] [End]

226
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,180
I heard Mayor Hong likes young girls.

227
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,910
So, besides Zhang Xin,

228
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,150
are there other girls?

229
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,120
What nonsense are you talking about?

230
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,250
I don't understand.

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,670
Listen,

232
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,910
I'm a man of principles.

233
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,470
I never gossip or pry into

234
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,470
the boss's affairs behind his back.

235
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,630
Principles?

236
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,550
Baoshuai.

237
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,160
Help Director Chen remember.

238
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,530
What are you going to do?

239
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,940
What are you...

240
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,990
Stop! Stop!

241
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,480
Please stop!

242
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,600
Mr. Liu!

243
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,480
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu! Please don't!

244
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,610
If they keep beating me, I'll die!

245
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,530
Director Chen,

246
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,360
do you remember anything now?

247
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,790
Mr. Liu...

248
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,150
I-I remember now.

249
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,790
I-I heard about something.

250
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,560
I wasn't in charge.

251
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,660
It was all Ms. Zhang.

252
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,000
What did you hear?

253
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,320
I heard

254
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,970
that a few days ago,

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,390
a college girl,

256
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,340
apparently Ms. Zhang's assistant,

257
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,670
got pregnant.

258
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,600
It was a boy,

259
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,480
so the boss really wanted to keep it.

260
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,150
But

261
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,590
something went wrong,

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,080
and that girl was disobedient.

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,780
Zhang Xin took care of everything
in the end.

264
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,670
What's that girl's name?

265
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,880
I really don't know.

266
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,260
I only heard about it.

267
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,200
Well, t-this isn't the first time

268
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,130
something like this has happened.

269
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,840
Anyway,

270
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,910
Zhang Xin

271
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,440
has been in charge of this.

272
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
I think

273
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,100
they had these girls live
in the same neighborhood.

274
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,910
Were those accounts opened
for these girls?

275
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,790
Probably.

276
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,160
I-I heard

277
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,440
that these years, the boss's

278
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,160
overseas accounts,

279
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,960
offshore accounts and the like,

280
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,870
are all held by these girls.

281
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,440
And they've already obtained

282
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,220
foreign citizenship.

283
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,990
Zhang Xin has managed it all.

284
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,080
Mr. Liu, how about this?

285
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Mr. Liu,

286
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,130
if y-you

287
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,270
have any plans,

288
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,480
we can sit down and talk calmly.

289
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,270
There's no need to flip the table.

290
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:53,910
Besides,

291
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,390
if you go against the boss,

292
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,790
you won't end up well.

293
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,340
[Select]

294
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,240
[Disconnected]

295
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,750
Mr. Liu?

296
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,670
Mr. Liu!

297
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,170
Don't hit me! Please don't!

298
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,330
I've told you everything!

299
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,460
Look into this matter.

300
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,270
Hanzhou is just a small city.

301
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,170
Find that neighborhood

302
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,550
and that girl.

303
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,160
The City Economic Forum is approaching.

304
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,200
All the major leaders in the province
will attend it.

305
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,260
These past few days have been so busy.

306
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,630
These years,

307
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,200
Hanzhou's economic growth

308
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,120
has been the frontrunner in the province.

309
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's why the higher-ups
specifically requested

310
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,130
that I give a speech.

311
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,840
Look.

312
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,020
Director Chen

313
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,150
was supposed to draft and polish it.

314
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,030
But now,

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,880
I have to write it myself.

316
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,380
By the way,

317
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,870
how's Director Chen?

318
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Is he okay?

319
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,970
He might feel a bit frustrated.

320
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,010
But don't worry.

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,960
I always

322
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,170
consider the dog's master

323
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,230
before hitting it.

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,660
Have a seat.

325
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,360
It's rare that no one else is here.

326
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,620
It's just the two of us,

327
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,130
sitting here face to face.

328
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,970
The task force's operation
has really tightened up these days.

329
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,600
If you want a mutually destructive fight,

330
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,200
you'll be the first to fall.

331
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,740
Sir, I'm well aware of your power,

332
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,620
but

333
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,170
where the fire spreads

334
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
depends on which way the wind blows.

335
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,620
You and Zhang Xin

336
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
are so close,

337
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,520
so why don't you persuade her

338
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
to leave Hanzhou?

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,270
You can do

340
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,880
business anywhere.

341
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,030
Longwan has come this far
from a small fishing village,

342
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,610
so we won't be anyone's pawns anymore.

343
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,150
We will

344
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,230
play the game on our own.

345
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,720
Who isn't a pawn?

346
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,050
Play the game yourself?

347
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,990
Even if you make it to my position,

348
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,920
neither of us will be the players,
understand?

349
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,670
You're just used by others.

350
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,270
A person's social nature,
or be it destiny,

351
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,440
is predetermined,

352
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,240
You can only stay where you belong.

353
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,670
Whether in politics or business,

354
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,080
no one can escape human nature.

355
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,600
Honestly, I'm an atheist.

356
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,240
But I still meditate and pray to Buddha

357
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,270
just to find peace

358
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,790
and where I truly belong.

359
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,240
If a person is too greedy,

360
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,310
they'll only be consumed
by their own sins.

361
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,680
So, here's a piece of advice, Liu.

362
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't let humans' weaknesses ruin you.

363
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,100
When it comes to greed and sins,

364
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm nowhere near your level.

365
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,920
Find Chen Shuifa.

366
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,310
Okay.

367
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,750
It's Tianfei's club.

368
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,590
Let's go in and take a look, okay?

369
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
I'll go in,

370
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,610
and you'll block them at the back door.

371
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,490
There are plainclothes officers.

372
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
Oh, your eyes are sharp.

373
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,750
Did you arrange this?

374
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,110
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

375
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,310
