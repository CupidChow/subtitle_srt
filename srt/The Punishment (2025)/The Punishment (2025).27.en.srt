Qin Taoyi used Sun Na's
personal information without permission

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,240
and opened a savings account for her.

19
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,710
This card shows multiple transfers,

20
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,400
including dividends from Longwan Logistics

21
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,050

Wen Bo and Sun Na were unaware of this.

Qin Taoyi's actions were illegal,

but considering the money
wasn't used for illegal purposes,

26
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,630
the relevant departments have decided
to impose a fine on him.

27
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,280

will be canceled immediately,

involved—

In this operation,

38
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,400
we conducted a comprehensive raid

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,530
and inspection of Longwan Logistics.

40
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,370
But we found no evidence of smuggling.

41
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,280
We also didn't find any other

The online reports about Longwan Logistics

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,750
contained false information.

45
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,000
However, during this period,

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
we received reports

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,720
about the Qunhuan Trading Company,

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,480

a lot of smuggled goods,

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,870
and arrested two main organizers.

50
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,690
Both of them have prior criminal records.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
So we did make some progress.

52
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,610

If you have something to say, just say it.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,950
There is a smuggling criminal gang
operating in Hanzhou.

55
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,630
We, Anti-Smuggling Bureau,
had already been keeping an eye on them.

56
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,890
They're very cunning.

57

59

Then, out of the blue, a single tip-off

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
brought a breakthrough.

This timing...

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,750

64
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,120
We can't trace it.

65
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120

66
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,290

67
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,280
have any connection
with Longwan Logistics?

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
We haven't found any connection so far.

69
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,870
Just because
we haven't found a connection

70
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,470
doesn't mean it isn't there.

71
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,040

72
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,750
the investigation into Longwan Logistics

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,680

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,790
Dr. Chen,

192
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,290
don't play dumb with me.

193
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,630
Whose bloody bandage is this?

194
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,360
Listen,

195
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,360
you're harboring a fugitive right now.

196
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,000
Talk!

197
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,630
Where is He Gang?

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,570
I really don't know.

199
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,750
A couple of nights ago, late at night,

200
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,910
Young Mr. He called me

201
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,110
saying he was injured

202
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,150
and asked me to come check on him.

203
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,030
So I came.

204
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
After I arrived, I realized

205
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,340
it was a gunshot wound.

206
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,150
I...

207
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,480
See,

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,550
we had an appointment

209
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,210
to change his bandages today.

210
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
I have no idea what's going on.

211
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,040
There's nobody here.

212
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,390
Young Mr. He didn't notify me, either.

213
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,720
How serious was his injury?

214
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,440
The wound wasn't treated properly
right away.

215
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,300
When I last saw him, he had a fever.

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,910
Based on the current situation,

217
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,170
he probably won't recover anytime soon.

218
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,570
Take him back first.

219
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,090
Let's go.

220
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,650
Let's go and check
the surveillance footage.

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,630
It's gone?

222
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,720
How could it be missing?

223
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,240
Last night, a trash can
suddenly caught fire,

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,570
so I went to check it out.

225
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,360
Fire! Fire! Wake up!

226
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,150
Where's the fire?

227
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,290
When I came back,

228
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,510
I found my colleague had been attacked.

229
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,200
I called for the police right away.

230
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
But when we checked
the surveillance footage,

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,610
it was missing, too.

232
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,840
What time did this happen last night?

233
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,670
Around

234
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,080
2:00 or 3:00 AM.

235
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,800
Let's go.

236
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,920
Hello. What can I do for you?

237
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,360
We're from
the Hanzhou Public Security Bureau.

238
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,910
Hello.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,790
Could you please show me

240
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,910
your surveillance footage

241
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,670
from 2:00 to 3:00 AM last night?

242
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,790
Sure, no problem.

243
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,390
Thank you.

244
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,200
Here.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,150
Stop.

246
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,150
Rewind a bit more.

247
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,000
OK.

248
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,120
Captain Qin.

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
We've found an unlicensed vehicle

250
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,550
and already contacted the Traffic Police
and the Department of Motor Vehicles.

251
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,080
Let's go.

252
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,940
Your brother disappeared.
Did your man pick him up?

253
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,120
Hello.

254
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,250
What can I do for you?

255
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,400
What were those two people looking at?

256
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,200
Let me see.

257
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,030
No problem.

258
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,170
Good. Thank you.

259
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,370
Let them stay on the sea for now.

260
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,120
If they need anything,
just have someone deliver it.

261
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,580
Alright, I'll arrange it.

262
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,230
Ms. Zhou.

263
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,030
Dr. Chen?

264
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,920
Long time no see.

265
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,480
What have you been up to lately?

266
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,540
It's a gift for you.

267
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,830
I got a gift? How thoughtful.

268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,160
It's a ritual.

269
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,600
Life needs rituals.

270
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
We even match outfits.

271
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,700
Yes.

272
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,080
Too bad there's no card game today.

273
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,820
Otherwise,

274
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,240
I would definitely show you

275
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,320
my newly developed

276
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,980
blackjack winning strategy.

277
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,120
My place is just a small boat;

278
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,630
it can't withstand any heavy storms
or waves.

279
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,080
If you want to play,

280
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,980
you can check out He Biao's place.

281
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,990
He doesn't have time.

282
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,610
You don't know yet?

283
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,080
He is in trouble.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,390
In trouble?

285
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,720
What happened?

286
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm only telling you this,

287
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,650
don't spread it around.

288
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,600
A couple of nights ago,

289
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,080
Young Mr. He called me.

290
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,670
He told me

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
he was injured.

292
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,670
He...

293
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,500
That's all he said.

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
He is drunk.

295
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,790
Do I need to bring them to you

296
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,390
so you can ask them yourself?

297
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,200
No need.

298
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,220
That's enough.

299
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,440
Okay.

300
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,770
Why don't you talk to your brother?

301
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,960
Sometimes you need to swallow your pride.

302
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,030
What's more important, business or family?

303
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,960
If this continues,

304
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,290
you won't last, either.

305
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,160
Fine.

306
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,220
I'll have a good talk with my brother.

307
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,960
About who's next

308
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,270
after I'm dead.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
Buddy.

310
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
I should thank you.

311
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,920
If it weren't for those hits you gave me,

312
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,680
I would have lived

313
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,350
my whole life in confusion.

314
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,960
Muzhi.

315
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,510
Gang?

316
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
Are you okay?

317
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,830
Don't worry, Muzhi.

318
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,510
Your brother has gotten into trouble.

319
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,830
The police are watching him now.

320
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,180
He can't leave Hanzhou, either.

321
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,900
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

322
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,070
Liu Tianye.

323
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,080
If you lay a hand on Gang,

324
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,080
you're forcing my hand.

325
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
That's right.

326
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,680
Lin's case has caused such a big mess.

327
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,510
I know you don't want to admit defeat.

328
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,510
And you want to drag me down with you,

329
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,030
right?

330
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,570
But now I have your brother.

331
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,410
What cards do you have left to play?

332
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,830
I'm advising you

333
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,110
to just focus on your business

334
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,240
and earn some money for your brother

335
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
so he can get away.

336
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,090
Don't touch my family.

337
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,820
Let's meet and talk.

338
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,800
Just you and me, one on one.

339
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,730
I'll be waiting.

340
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,750
Tianye,

341
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,400
they have no cards left to play.

342
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Are we still going to play with them?

343
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,010
He knows too much about us.

344
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,680
Keeping him around is always trouble.

345
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,550
Let's talk first if possible.

346
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,750
If that doesn't work,

347
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,940
we'll take care of him.

348
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,360
Alright.

349
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,240
Sir,

350
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,030
how's the investigation going?

351
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,830
The Anti-Smuggling Bureau found nothing.

352
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,630
Longwan Logistics has already
moved everything.

353
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,440
What about Gang?

354
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,510
Don't worry.

355
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,550
I've found leads on him.

356
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,890
Wait for my update.

357
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,750
Okay.

358
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,480
War has broken out between the two sides.

359
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
No matter how their fight turns out,

360
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,650
keep an eye on them.

361
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,510
Be ready at any time.

362
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,720
Cut ties if things go wrong.

363
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,030
Copy that.

364
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,290
What did you want to say
by calling me out here?

365
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,880
[Ancestral Hall
of the Liu, Wen, and Qin Families]

366
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Nothing special.

367
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,310
It's just that recently,

368
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,970
so many things have happened
one after another.

369
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,590
I remembered how hard it was
for us in Longwan

370
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,040
and how difficult our journey was.

371
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,240
I'm just afraid

372
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
our family might fall apart.

373
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,030
Jiangyan.

374
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,920
Can you do me a favor?

375
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,270
What is it?

376
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,750
Jiangyan,

377
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,480
you're back?

378
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,530
It's so late.

379
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,920
You're still up?

380
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,750
The meeting is tomorrow.

381
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,450
I hope

382
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,310
everything gets better after tomorrow.

383
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,490
I love looking at your childhood photos.

384
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,880
So adorable.

385
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,930
What's on your mind, Jiangyan?

386
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,070
Mom,

387
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
I'm planning to marry Jiajun

388
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,030
once this is all over.

389
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,550
Jiajun

390
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,130
is pretty good to me.

391
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,640
That's wonderful!

392
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,920
Jiangyan.

393
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,960
Hurry up.

394
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,960
Here.

395
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,970
Open it and see.

396
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,960
Open it.

397
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,350
Try it on.

398
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,400
Come on.

399
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,750
Isn't it too small for me?

400
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,550
No, it's not. Try it on.

401
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,550
Slowly.

402
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,030
It actually fits.

403
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,000
How beautiful.

404
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,030
It's lovely,

405
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,440
really lovely.

406
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,140
It doesn't look as nice as
when my mom wore it when she was young.

407
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,250
You still remember, right?

408
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,200
This bracelet

409
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,640
was given to your mother

410
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,440
by your grandmother when she got married.

411
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,530
I think today it can be passed on to you.

412
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,720
She would be so happy.

413
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,840
That little girl from back then

414
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,270
has grown up now.

415
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,880
I can tell her

416
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,120
I've completed my mission.

417
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,730
I've raised your daughter

418
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,270
into

419
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,880
a beautiful, elegant young lady.

420
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,540
Thank you, Mom.

421
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,130
That's wonderful.

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,750
Mom.

423
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,240
Look at you.

424
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,240
What's wrong?

425
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,830
I'm not even married yet.

426
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,550
It makes me sad, too.

427
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,850
What's there to be sad about?
I'm just happy about it.

428
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,000
You silly child.

429
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,830
Happy.

430
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,750
Jiangyan.

431
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,110
Listen.

432
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,830
Since you were little,

433
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,630
you've always

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,440
liked to keep everything

435
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,340
buried in your heart
without saying it out loud.

436
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,510
Now you're starting your own family.

437
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,480
I just hope

438
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,160
you'll be happy every day from now on.

439
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,350
Okay?

440
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,350
I will, Mom.

441
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,940
Why are you crying?

442
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,830
Mom.

443
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,660
You've been the best to me.

444
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,310
You've been good to me, too.

445
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
My good child.

446
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,440
I'll always be with you.

447
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,750
[Ancestral Hall
of the Liu, Wen, and Qin Families]

448
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,880
Today, we're holding the Longwan Logistics
shareholders meeting.

449
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,400
The board of directors has already sent

450
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,160
written notices to all shareholders
according to the bylaws.

451
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,590
The number of attendees
exceeds two-thirds.

452
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,920
So the meeting will proceed as scheduled.

453
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,800
Now, let me introduce...

454
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,690
That's enough.

455
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,640
Let's skip the formalities.

456
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,270
That's fine.

457
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sure everyone knows

458
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,720
why we're here today.

459
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,790
Liu Tianye,

460
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,280
as the General Manager
of Longwan Logistics,

461
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,880
has been making unilateral decisions
during his tenure

462
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,540
and hasn't fought
for our long-term interests.

463
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,090
On the contrary,

464
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,000
he has brought many bad practices
to the company.

465
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,350
So today I propose

466
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
that we elect a new General Manager.

467
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
If you trust me,

468
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,980
please vote for me.

469
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm sorry, Mom. I...

470
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
I'd like to take up
a bit of everyone's time.

471
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,000
Just now...

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,590
You don't need to say anything.

473
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,250
Let's proceed according
to the company bylaws.

474
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,240
Right.

475
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,610
According to the company bylaws,

476
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,000
as long as there are enough votes,

477
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,060
one can be elected.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,060
I believe I'm more suitable
to lead Longwan Logistics.

479
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,120
So this time,

480
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,070
I will participate in the election.

481
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,960
Jiangyan,

482
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,880
what are you doing?

483
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Mom,

484
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,680
trust me.

485
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,610
I've made thorough preparations.

486
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,310
Everyone.

487
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,660
I know that

488
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,200
many things have happened
in Longwan recently

489
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,860
that have affected all of you.

490
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,590
I've assembled a professional legal team

491
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,790
to work with me to resolve these issues.

492
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,030
I will definitely provide you
with answers.

493
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,750
But Longwan
has more fundamental problems

494
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,210
that need to be addressed.

495
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,570
The company's future development

496
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
requires reform.

497
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,140
We must keep up with the times.

498
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,960
We must learn from our mistakes.

499
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,000
I promise you all here

500
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,200
that I will do my utmost

501
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,200
to protect everyone's interests

502
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
and lead Longwan on a clean path,

503
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,930
away from all controversy.

504
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,000
Please vote for me.

505
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,050
I vote for Jiangyan.

506
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,880
Jiangyan is well-educated,

507
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
capable,

508
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,330
and detail-oriented.

509
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,700
Just as she mentioned,

510
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,070
she has already assembled

511
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,600
a professional legal team.

512
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This provides the company

513
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
with strong legal protection
for the future.

514
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,250
As for me,

515
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,200
today,

516
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,000
I resign from all my positions
at Longwan Logistics.

517
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,420
Please vote for Jiangyan.

518
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,520
Thank you.

519
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,170
Xinrui Group
took over Qiao Defu's business—

520
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,530
You must have been the middleman, right?

521
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,280
And those things that happened
to Qiao Defu

522
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,510
were also related to you.

523
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,510
I got to know Qiao Defu in the first place

524
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,070
just so that

525
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,670
I could collaborate
with Xinrui Group one day.

526
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,440
Have you ever seen this much money?

527
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,080
If I had this money earlier,

528
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,550
Longwan wouldn't have been bullied,

529
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,680
and our loved ones wouldn't have left.

530
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,950
This is the future I want,

531
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
a future where we're not pushed around.

532
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,110
Everything you see now

533
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,520
is what gives me confidence.

534
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,360
I have a buddy called Ran.

535
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,320
He was in the trading business.

536
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,440
He was arrested.

537
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,060
You were the informant, weren't you?

538
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,240
It was me.

539
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,070
Not just Ran,

540
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,610
I have plenty of other evidence, too.

541
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,590
Smuggling.

542
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,940
Money laundering.

543
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,330
Illegal transactions.

544
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,550
Regarding
this major anti-smuggling operation,

545
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,830
you've legally cut all ties,

546
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,590
but as for other related documents,

547
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,820
I have kept backups of all of them.

548
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
A law graduate...

549
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,890
Impressive.

550
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,550
So you, a law graduate,
target your own family members, huh?

551
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,960
So, how are you going
to deal with all of this?

552
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,890
Give them to Mom?

553
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,040
Or will you give them to Feng?

554
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,240
Tianye.

555
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,750
I know

556
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,310
you've sacrificed everything

557
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,110
for this family and for Longwan.

558
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,250
But wrong is wrong.

559
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,800
And the law is the law.

560
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,850
What you are doing right now is a crime.

561
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,800
You'll lead Longwan
into an abyss of no return.

562
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,590
This evidence...

563
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,080
I can choose not to hand it over.

564
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,090
What do you mean?

565
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,900
I won't let Mom
take Longwan back to the past,

566
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,090
but I won't let you drag Longwan
into the gutter, either.

567
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,110
At this shareholders' meeting,

568
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,810
I want you to support me.

569
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,880
From today onwards,

570
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,070
Longwan must stay clean.

571
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
Now let's begin the vote.

572
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,920
Those in favor of Wen Jiangyan

573
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,350
becoming the new General Manager

574
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,720
of Longwan Logistics,

575
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,760
raise your hand.

576
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,110
I agree.

577
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,200
I agree, too.

I agree as well.

Agree.

586
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
I agree.

587
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,240
I agree.

588
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,310
-I agree.
-I agree as well.

589
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,270
-Agree.
-Agree.

590
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,070
-I agree.
-I agree as well.

591
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,590
The votes have exceeded the majority.

592
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,850
The motion is carried.

593
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,160
Wen Jiangyan will serve as

594
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,760
the new General Manager
of Longwan Logistics.

595
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,400
Mom.

597
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,000
I hope everything you're doing
will be worthwhile.

598
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,550
Mom.

599
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,310
Leave it to me.

600
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,790
Okay.

601
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,000
Everyone, please assemble at the square.

602
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,730
I have an announcement to make.

603
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,200
For 300 years,

604
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,130
Longwan has continued its legacy.

605
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,160
To ensure future generations remain united

606
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,360
and protect Longwan,

607
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,230
our ancestors established many rules.

608
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,590
These rules

609
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,810
were all bought with blood and tears.

610
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,360
The rules cannot be broken.

611
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,550
The heavy losses
Longwan suffered this time

612
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,880
were because someone broke the rules.

613
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,080
Those who have done wrong

614
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,840
must face the consequences.

615
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I ask these people

616
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,660
to voluntarily leave Longwan

617
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,060
and remove themselves
from the ancestral hall.

618
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,160

619
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,070
Can you do me a favor?

620
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,590
What is it?

621
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,000
If you become

622
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,639
the General Manager of Longwan Logistics,

623
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,280
I hope you can use your authority
in the clan

624
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,440
to remove me,

625
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,800

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,199

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,670
Yes.

No matter who gets in trouble,

636

it won't be connected to Longwan anymore.

637
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Longwan needs to stay clean.

638
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,870
This is also a way to protect our family.

639

Please leave Longwan.

Jiangyan.

645
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,590
Tianye just stepped down for you,

646
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,490
and now you're kicking him out.

647
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,770
What do you mean?

648
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,600
You planned this all along, didn't you?

649
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,270
Jiangyan.

650
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,280
Let me

651
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,410
say something.

652
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,070
Look,

653
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,230
you kids

654
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,260
grew up playing together.

655
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,880
You've known each other

656
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,340
since you were in diapers.

657
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,670
What you just said

658
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,190
truly moved me.

659
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,440
But,

660
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,490
these last two sentences—

661
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,720
I really can't accept them.

662
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,600
Jiangyan.

663
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,480
Just look at

664
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,710
what Longwan has become now.

665
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,540
Compared to the Longwan
when Dayong was around,

666
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
it's changed so much.

667
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,760
Today,

668
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,000
in front of everyone,

669
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,840
let me say something fair.

670
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,920
Without Tianye's hard work,

671
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,000
would Longwan be what it is today? Right?

672
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes.

673
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,840
Besides,

674
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,920
today everyone elected you

675
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,510
as the General Manager of the company,

676
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,190
not the clan leader of Longwan, Jiangyan.

677
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,670
So,

678
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
when it comes to the ancestral hall,

679
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,960
your mother still has the final say.

680
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,760
That's right.

681
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,440
Jiangyan,

682
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,000
your mother hasn't even spoken yet.

683
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,400
This isn't appropriate, is it?

684
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,190
Exactly.

685
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,000
Without Tianye, we wouldn't have

686
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,470
what we have today in Longwan.

687
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,600
I fully support Jiangyan's decision.

688
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,880
Since we all elected

689
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,740
Jiangyan as the General Manager,

690
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,020
I must follow her lead.

build me a swimming pool.

754
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,010
-I'll have a pool party here every day.
-I'll arrange it for you.

755
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,390
By the way, Tianye,

756
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,440
should we invite Ziyi
and the others to come over?

757
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,770
They

758
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,850
probably won't come anymore.

759
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,190
Tianye,

760
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
what are your thoughts about

761
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,510
your relationship with Ziyi?
