This isn't that simple.

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,190
Sister.

194
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,360
I already know what happened.

195
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,350
Don't worry.

196
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll figure something out.

197
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,120
Go home first

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
and try not to worry.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,990
No, no, no.

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,060
Hanzhang.

201
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,600
You're the only official
our whole family has ever supported.

202
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,560
If I can't rely on you,

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,870
who else can I turn to?

204
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,560
Didn't I say I'd work on it?

205
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,810
Keep your voice down.

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,520
You...

207
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,510
Lower your voice.

208
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,600
I'll lower my voice.

209
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,720
You must help me.

210
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Go back first.

211
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,240
Hurry up.

212
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,120
We'll go back and wait for updates.

213
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,020
Okay.

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,080
I'll look into it.

215
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,160
Okay.

216
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,040
Okay.

217
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,580
Director Peng.

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,210
The fact that you thought of me
when your family had trouble

219
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,860
shows you still consider me a friend.

220
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,450
I came to ask you something.

221
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,770
Did you deliberately

222
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,480
set up the accident?

223
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,870
So now

224
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,270
you're here to solve a case?

225
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,240
I think the most urgent matter now

226
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,010
is to save your nephew.

227
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,960
About your nephew's issue,

228
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,090
I can solve it with just one phone call.

229
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll call right now.

230
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,520
Biao.

231
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,070
Are you pushing your luck?

232
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,320
After I went back last time, I thought
about it and decided to let it go.

233
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,490
It's all ancient history now.

234
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,450
I can put up with it.

235
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,060
We can each live our own lives in peace.

236
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,530
If you push me like this,

237
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,450
then it will be
mutually assured destruction.

238
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,510
Peng Hanzhang, have you lost your mind?

239
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,080
What?

240
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,980
You think any little thing
that happens in your family

241
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,420
is all my doing?

242
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,000
You're jumping at shadows.

243
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,820
Being a cop has made you paranoid.

244
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,090
Let me tell you.

245
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,080
You should think carefully about

246
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,480
where you came from.

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,410
I know about your family.

248
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,250
Your parents died early.

249
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,200
Your eldest sister brought up

250
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,740
all of you the hard way, didn't she?

251
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,150
How did you become Deputy Director?

252
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,330
Your eldest sister
paid for your education!

253
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,380
So what now?

254
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,540
Now she's in trouble.

255
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,580
Her child is in trouble.

256
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,390
Who can she rely on?

257
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,340
You only think about
yourself all day long.

258
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,680
Hanzhang.

259
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,470
I know you're a person

260
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,960
who's honest and clean as an official.

261
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,600
You've never given
or taken a bribe in your life.

262
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,840
After all these decades

263
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,940
of work,

264
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,780
why are you still just a Deputy Director?

265
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm quite content.

266
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,980
Well, I'm not content.

267
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,510
Why should you be?

268
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,990
Let me tell you.

269
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,250
It's because you never socialize,

270
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,860
because you don't network.

271
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,080
Only by networking

272
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,810
can people help each other out.

273
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,630
I'm now working closely

274
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,360
with someone called Zhang Xin.

275
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,640
The person above her

276
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,750
has enormous power

277
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,410
and can make anything happen.

278
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,750

279
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,480
from this deputy director post

280
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,280
is just one word from them.

281
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,890
I've decided.

282
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,660
I must connect you
with them

283
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,490
and help you climb another step up.

broken capital chain,

Chengjian headquarters responded today,

286
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,190
stating the rumors
are completely unfounded.

287
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,840
Chengjian Group has sufficient funds

288
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,130

289
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,930

290
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,650

to happen at the port.

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,830
And then what?

564
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,240
If you take care of He Biao,

565
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,590
will your brother be released?

566
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,270
Can we stop thinking
about eliminating people

567
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,130
and focus on solving the problem?

568
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,770
We definitely can't touch He Biao now.

569
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,340
Feng has been watching
He Biao and Qiao Defu.

570
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,240
If we move against He Biao now,

571
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,360
how will Tianye explain it to Feng?

572
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,000
We can't do this. We can't do that.

573
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,270
So what do you suggest?

574
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,720
Why are we all gathered here

575
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,510
if we can't do anything?

576
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,400
We need to come up with a solution.

577
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,480
Isn't that what we're trying to do?

578
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,810
Alright, stop arguing.

579
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,320
For now, let's not do anything.

580
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,640
Peng,

581
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,310
put the smuggling business
on hold for now.

582
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,790
Okay?

583
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,880
We can't afford
any more problems right now.

584
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
Understand?

585
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,010
From what we can see,

586
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,960
the city government
has launched an investigation.

587
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,440
It probably won't end anytime soon.

588
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,030
Is the problem

589
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,750
with Chengjian Group serious?

590
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,120
Qiao Defu must have quite a few issues
behind him too, right?

591
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,240
I dare not speak carelessly about that.

592
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,480
Everything depends
on the city government's
investigation results.

593
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,000
I heard that Qiao Defu

594
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,160
owes a lot of money from gambling.

595
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,920
Really?

596
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
In this world,

597
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,660
gamblers are the least trustworthy people.

598
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,510
Don't you think

599
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,400
your brother rushed into
this partnership too quickly?

600
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
My brother was just
too eager to make this deal happen.

601
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,590
Xin.

602
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,870
I know you have many connections

603
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,130
and surely know people who could help.

604
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,680
I'm afraid this investigation
might drag on forever.

605
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,750
I have no idea when

606
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,350
my brother will be released.

607
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,680
I know

608
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,150
I'm being presumptuous,

609
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,350
but I still want to ask you

610
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,680
to help save my brother.

611
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,750
I'm glad that you thought of me

612
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,280
first when you needed help.

613
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,110
Don't give me pleasantries.

614
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,510
I don't organize
class reunions for nothing.

615
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,640
It's all about helping each other out.

616
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,000
Your brother isn't really involved
in the fund misappropriation.

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,590
This issue shouldn't be too serious.

618
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,990
I'll help you ask
around at the city office.

619
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,310
Thank you, Xin.

620
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,920
But

621
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,780
I'm afraid the funds

622
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,720
from Longwan

623
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,780
won't be recovered anytime soon.

624
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,510
Do you have any plans?

625
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,410
I'll just take it one step at a time.

626
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,490
As long as everyone is safe,

627
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,310
and the Longwan business is still running,

628
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,830
we can get through this
no matter how difficult it is.

629
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,160
I believe in my brother.

630
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,150
You're quite tough, aren't you?

631
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,480
Alright.

632
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,380
Being anxious
won't help in this situation.

633
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,120
Let's go.

634
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,750
[Serve the People]

635
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,400
Let's go.

636
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,950
Let's go home for dinner.

637
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,270
Is everything okay at home?

638
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,000
It's fine.

639
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,270
Is Qiao Defu out yet?

640
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,280
He's not out yet.

641
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,700
So are both our funds

642
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,400
and Zhao Village's funds unrecoverable?

643
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,940
I don't know either.

644
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,260
Let's go home first.

645
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,720
Tianye.

646
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,970
I've missed you so much!

647
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm sorry, Mom.

648
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,250
You must be hungry.

649
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,250
I've made food for you.

650
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,910
Come on, let's go home and eat.

651
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,270
Tianye.

652
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,320
Tianye.

653
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Don't look back. Just step over.

654
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,160
The fire will remove bad luck.

655
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
Can we go home now?

656
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,640
Yes.

657
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,790
Coming.

658
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,920
Help Mom carefully.

659
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,190
Madam Wen.

660
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,000
These days,

661
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,630
people in the village

662
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,240
have been talking about this.

663
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,700
You need to make a decision

664
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,380
and talk to everyone about it.

665
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,850
But things are what they are now.

666
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,160
We must face it.

667
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
If there's no other way,

668
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,030
we can write IOUs for the villagers.

669
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,240
My reputation might
still be worth something.

670
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,070
Mom.

671
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,960
According to the Civil Procedure Law,

672
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,490
in our situation,

673
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,590
the court will most likely rule

674
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,750
in favor of our
property preservation application.

675
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,210
So once
the Chengjian Group case is settled,

676
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
our money

677
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,750
will be recovered, at least partially.

678
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,130
You don't need to worry about this now.

679
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,790
Qiao Defu's case

680
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,710
won't be resolved anytime soon.

681
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,830
Even after the final verdict,

682
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,790
after all the procedures are completed,

683
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,120
it will still take time.

684
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,960
I think what you're saying is

685
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,070
not helpful either.

686
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,680
I think Mom is right.

687
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,830
We need to talk to the villagers.
I'll go talk to them.

688
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,720
I'll go.

689
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,110
Limin.

690
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,960
Come with me to the village committee.

691
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,790
We need to resolve what can be resolved

692
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,350
and give the villagers an explanation.

693
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,920
Yes.

694
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,380
It's all Qiao Defu's fault.

695
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,750
He hasn't been released yet,

696
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,240
right?

697
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,740
Just wait until he gets out.

698
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,590
I'll make him pay for this.

699
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,920
I have all the time in the world.

700
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,980
I'll wear him down.

701
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,640
Tianfei.

702
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,080
Come here.

703
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,750
Sit here.

704
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,810
What is it, Feng?

705
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,940
What have you been up to lately?

706
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,670
You've been buying a car

707
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,880
and all sorts of stuff lately—
what's going on?

708
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,550
Just doing some small business with

709
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,510
a few buddies.

710
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,930
Don't show off. Don't mess around.

711
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,770
I have a gift for you.

712
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,510
A gift?

713
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,380
Is this yours?

714
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,740
Yes, it's mine.

715
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,520
How did you get it?

716
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,560
That's what I wanted to ask you.

717
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,750
What's your relationship with Su Hongbao?

718
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,510
Su...

719
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,070
Su...

720
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,220
Who is Su Hongbao?

721
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Ask him who Su Hongbao is.

722
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,750
Who is Su Hongbao?

723
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,770
Su Hongbao...

724
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,700
What's going on, Tianfei?

725
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,880
I...

726
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,270
I don't know Su Hongbao.

727
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,160
You don't know him
but your lighter was with him?

728
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,600
I...

729
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,810
Tianfei, let me tell you.

730
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Su Hongbao is an ex-con who just got out.

731
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,510
His business isn't clean.

732
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,780
Stay away from them.

733
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,850
Don't get involved with them.

734
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,530
How did you get mixed
up with these people?

735
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,790
I understand, Feng.

736
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,550
I...

737
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,180
Let me be honest with you.

738
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,070
I just borrowed money from Su Hongbao.

739
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,240
But I really didn't know
about his background.

740
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,720
I wanted to get a new car recently.

741
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,200
So I borrowed some money from him.

742
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,550
I didn't do anything else.

743
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,010
Really.

744
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,630
Borrowing money
isn't illegal, right, Feng?

745
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,520
You borrowed money to buy a car?

746
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Was that car absolutely necessary?

747
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,960
If you keep getting involved with them,

748
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,720
you'll end up getting arrested someday.

749
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
And then it won't be me
questioning you, understand?

750
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,350
Did you hear me?

751
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,610
I know.

752
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,350
Did you hear me?

753
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,490
I understand, Feng.

754
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,440
Feng, don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

755
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,550
I mean, borrowing money
isn't illegal, so why...

756
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,940
I think Feng is right.

757
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,750
You should stay away from

758
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,510
those shady characters...

759
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,960
Let's go.

760
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,550
Wait.

761
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
Did you know about this?

762
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,070
I had no idea. How would I know?

763
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,470
Did you know, Tianye?

764
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,920
How much did you borrow?

765
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,160
You borrowed so much money
without telling anyone.

766
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
How are you going to pay it back?

767
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,880
Well, Feng...

768
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,140
What are you implying?

769
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,570
Interrogating me?

770
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,060
We're at home,

771
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,070
not at the Public Security Bureau.

772
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,200
What's this about? Tianye just got out.

773
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,440
Now we owe all this money,

774
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,970
and you're turning around
interrogating me?

775
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,890
What's in it for me?

776
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,520
Who have I offended?

777
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
Have you lost your mind?

778
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,820
Uncle Tianfei,

779
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,990
Uncle Feng doesn't mean it that way.

780
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,270
-He's worried about you.
-I'm interrogating you?

781
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,590
If something happens,

782
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,790
I won't be the one
coming for you, understand?

783
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,920
Don't you know
what those people are involved in?

784
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,000
Quickly, take him back to sleep.

785
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,680
He's drunk.

786
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Lost his mind.

787
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,690
I'm not drunk.

788
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,540
Drunk?

789
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,210
That's enough.

790
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,160
Who have I offended?

791
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,510
Shut up. Shut up.

792
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,960
He's getting more and more brazen.

793
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,720
He dares to do anything.

794
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,050
Don't waste words on him. He's just drunk.

795
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,270
You really need to keep an eye on him.

796
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,270
This is not a joke.

797
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,830
I'm telling you,
this shot is all about the basics.

798
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,620
I got this.

799
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Watch carefully.

800
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,990
Basic skills?

801
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
I miscued.

802
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,240
Can I try again?

803
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,520
Try again?

804
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,960
How many times have you played already?

805
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,350
And still asking for another try.

806
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,350
Have you no shame?

807
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,240
You guys win.

808
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,590
After it's done,

809
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,830
I won't take a penny of his money.

810
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,970
All his business will be yours.

811
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,290
This way, you and your brothers

812
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,550
will never worry
about making ends meet.

813
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,080
Is this really appropriate, Zhao Peng?

814
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,680
Brother?

815
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,260
Uncle Tianfei.

816
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,160
What exactly happened?

817
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,920
How did your lighter
end up with Su Hongbao?

818
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,440
How would I know how it

819
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,040
got into Su Hongbao's hands?

820
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,030
I just borrowed
some money from Su Hongbao.

821
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,830
I didn't do anything else
and I've paid it all back.

822
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,920
If I had known he was Ma Jin's man,

823
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,960
I would never have approached him.

824
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,550
Your Uncle Tianfei has always
been a big spender.

825
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,790
He's even borrowed money from me before.

826
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,000
You could have talked this through calmly.

827
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,400
He was only asking
because he cared about you.

828
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
There was no need to argue.

829
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Do you think I wanted to argue with him?

830
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,840
Just look at him.

831
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,180
Scolding me in front of the whole family.

832
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,840
Don't I deserve some respect?

833
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,070
Uncle Feng spoke a bit harshly,

834
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,440
but he was not wrong.

835
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,380
Those people are no good.

836
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,370
Don't associate with them.

837
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,750
Okay, I know.

838
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,720
I don't need you telling me what to do.

839
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,450
I'm not telling you what to do.

840
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,160
But you,

841
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,720
Bo.

842
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,070
I mean,

843
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,640
being a police officer,

844
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,300
what are you getting out of it?

845
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,760
Running around in all weather,
what have you earned?

846
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,590
You might as well come back home.

847
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,510
There's so much to do here at home,

848
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,160
right?

849
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,070
Although something
has happened in our family recently,

850
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,730
I'm telling you,
Tianye can handle everything.

851
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,710
I didn't become
a police officer for money.

852
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,350
Bo should do whatever he likes.

853
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,030
Nobody's stopping him.

854
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,200
The point is, is he even making any money?

855
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,860
Just busy for nothing all day.

856
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,320
You're really talking
a bit too much today.

857
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,000
Bo.

858
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,420
Don't listen to him.

859
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,850
If you like it,

860
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,810
just go for it.

861
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,760
Don't worry.

862
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,750
As long as we're here,

863
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,440
the family will hold.

864
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,930
Okay?

865
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,880
Tianye.

866
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,150
I admit

867
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,480
I was wrong
about this situation with Feng.

868
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,340
I shouldn't have argued with him.

869
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,590
Anyway, from now on, Feng

870
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,370
will keep a close eye
on He Biao and Su Hongbao.

871
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,710
Could you please
be more careful in the future?

872
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,290
Alright, don't worry.

873
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,110
What about Qiao Defu?

874
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,840
This is too pathetic.

875
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,190
I finally see it clearly now.

876
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Chengjian Group's financial hole
didn't appear overnight.

877
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,110
The business negotiations
went so smoothly

878
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,370
that it shows Qiao Defu

879
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,010
never intended to do business with us.

880
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,210
This incident with Chengjian

881
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,310
proves that Qiao Defu
is definitely problematic.

882
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,630
But Zhang Xin hasn't made
any moves behind the scenes.

883
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,800
She simply wants us to fight with He Biao.

884
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,380
In the end,

885
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,810
we're just pawns in someone else's game.

886
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,590
Everyone wants the port business,

887
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,760
but even if we get it,

888
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,710
it's a thankless job.

889
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,480
If you ask me,

890
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,440
we should just let it go.

891
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,510
Just give it up.

892
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,150
Whoever wants it can have it.

893
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,710
We don't need to get worked up over this.

894
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,110
So you don't care
about that money anymore?

895
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,420
Of course I care!

896
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,170
But what can we do about it?

897
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,280
Just consider it money thrown away.

898
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,000
At worst, we'll make a few more shipments.

899
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
We can always make the money back, right?

900
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,050
I think Tianfei makes
a good point this time.

901
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:41,110
We've already made
quite a bit from smuggling.

902
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,340
We really can't continue
the smuggling business in Longwan anymore.

903
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,000
I think the port project

904
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,410
is our last bargaining chip

905
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,110
and our opportunity to go legitimate.

906
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,110
We must secure it.

907
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,800
Contact Su.

908
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,560
The moment Qiao Defu is released,
take action.

909
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,070
Headache again?

910
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,810
Did I wake you up?

911
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,290
I'm not asleep either.

912
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,030
Go to sleep.

913
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,730
I know you've been
under a lot of pressure lately.

914
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,690
But we haven't really
talked for a long time.

915
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,030
I'm sorry

916
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,750
for making you worry.

917
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,920
With so much happening lately,

918
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,520
I always feel uneasy.

919
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,980
Is there anything you want to tell me?

920
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,480
When this is all over,

921
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,390
I'll talk to you then.

922
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,400
Okay.

923
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,280
When everything's over,

924
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,740
we'll have a good talk.

925
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,590
Cheers.

926
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,580
Do you know people from Longwan?

927
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,640
What Longwan?

928
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,930
What do you mean?

929
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
That lighter

930
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,380
is the one I took from you.

931
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
The one I took from you.

932
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,510
So many people come and go at my place.

933
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,480
You took a lighter.

934
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,400
How would I know whose it was?
What are you getting at?

935
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,330
Get to the point.

936
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,850
Let me give you some advice.

937
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,500
Stay away from those Longwan people.

938
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,540
My junior isn't happy.

939
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,680
Your junior isn't happy?

940
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,030
Just tell me if you agree or not.

941
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,710
I agree.

942
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Mai, let me tell you,

943
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,730
I'll agree to whatever you say.

944
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,460
Can you also agree to one thing for me?

945
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,280
Speak.

946
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,510
Retire.

947
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,800
Let's quit.

948
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,800
I'll earn some money at the pawnshop.

949
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,040
It'll be enough for us
to live on for life.

950
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,440
By the way,

951
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,570
I signed up for a tour

952
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,000
with Jiu,

953
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,460
one of those immersive experiences.

954
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,210
Let's enjoy ourselves.

955
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,510
In this life,

956
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,880
we've spent half our lives
living for others.

957
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,480
It's time to live
for ourselves for a few years.

958
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,280
I'm not going.

959
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,410
I'm not going anywhere
until this matter is settled.

960
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,950
Are you really eager to travel,

961
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,550
or are you trying to get rid of me

962
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,750
so you can handle something on your own?

963
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,190
Handling something on my own?

964
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,590
What things would I have?

965
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
What could I possibly need to do now?

966
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,030
Mai, listen to me.

967
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,810
Who cares about He Biao,

968
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,340
Qiao Defu, or the Boss?

969
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,490
Are they important?

970
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,590
Are we going to live our lives or not?

971
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,920
Evil people will be
dealt with by other evil people.

972
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,550
Just let them fight it out.

973
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,710
Well, why can't you...

974
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,240
Why can't you just let it go?

975
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,070
I really can't let it go.

976
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,670
I don't care what they do,

977
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,800
but this thing has been like a stone

978
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,150
weighing on my heart for years.

979
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,110
Xiaoyue is gone.

980
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,960
Xu Li is gone.

981
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,590
Su, at my age,

982
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,780
if I don't get to the bottom of this,

983
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,760
no one will ever know the truth.

984
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,420
Even if you find out the truth,

985
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,280
will it bring the dead back to life?

986
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,830
The dead won't come back,

987
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,780
but the living can at least

988
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,360
die with peace of mind.

989
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,590
Mai,

990
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,880
you used to always tell me

991
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,920
to stop causing trouble

992
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,880
and live a peaceful life.

993
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,700
You were right.

994
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,530
Don't make trouble.

995
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,400
Live a good life.

996
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm giving you

997
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,920
your exact words back.

998
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,070
Not just you alone,

999
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,570
even if you got me involved

1000
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,550
and all our brothers too,

1001
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,970
we still couldn't touch those big shots.

1002
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,840
Understand?

1003
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,380
Big shots?

1004
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,780
Su, tell me what makes someone a big shot.

1005
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,590
Xiaoyue was a big shot.

1006
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,460
Xu Li was a big shot.

1007
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,720
I, Mai Hongchao, am a big shot.

1008
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,900
I'm telling you now,

1009
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,120
I refuse to believe
I can't take them down in my lifetime.

1010
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,650
Have you made up your mind?

1011
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,030
If you go after Qiao Defu,

1012
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,840
you'll need to lay low for a while.

1013
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,110
Take all this money.

1014
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,560
Everything I promised you

1015
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,510
will come true.

1016
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,140
After He Biao falls,

1017
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,020
all his business will be yours.
