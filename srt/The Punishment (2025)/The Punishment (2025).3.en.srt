00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,180
What is he trying to do?

195
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,160
Director Ye.

196
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,350
Director Yan, Director Peng.

197
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,990
Haven't seen you in years,
and we meet here.

198
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,580
I really had no choice. This matter—

199
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,240
[Retention Room]

200
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
Enough.

201
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,429
Qin Feng,

202
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,130
what happened, really?

203
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,809
Who wronged you?

204
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Director Yan,

205
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
please calm down.

206
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,710
The situation is quite clear.

207
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,900
I have something
to show all the directors.

208
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,680
Chief Zhang.

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,090
Chief Zhang?

210
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,030
[Retention Room]

211
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,790
Zhang!

212
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,850
Here!

213
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,010
Come on. Come on.

214
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,880
Hurry up.

215
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,830
[Retention Room]

216
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,910
You know all the directors, right?

217
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,340
Yes, Yes.

218
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,550
Everyone, this is

219
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,010
Chief Zhang Wei
from Gaoxin Police Station.

220
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,510
He is a frontline police officer

221
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,900
and enforces the law impartially.

222
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,360
He's had me stuck here all night.

223
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,080
Well.

224
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,550
I was just doing my job.

225
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,560
Where...

226
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,760
where's that thing?

227
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,720
Here.

228
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,010
Okay.

229
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,230
I'll leave you all to your work then.

230
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,280
Director Ye,

231
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,690
take a look at this.

232
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,840
Fortunately, we prepared in advance.

233
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,510
I want to have a smoke first.

234
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,920
Go ahead. It's fine.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,550
Don't...

236
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,020
don't be nervous. Take your time.

237
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,700
No rush.

238
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,610
With the police backing you up,
what are you afraid of?

239
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,670
Think about it. Think carefully.

240
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,000
Police brutality! Forced confession!

241
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,350
[Retention Room]

242
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,650
Director Ye.

243
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,470
I think we should send someone

244
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,000
to bring this Qian guy back.

245
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,670
[Retention Room]

246
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,760
Come on.

247
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
If you had evidence,

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,840
why didn't you show it earlier?

249
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,330
Yes.

250
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,550
I did cause trouble for you.

251
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,960
I just wanted an opportunity

252
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,950
to report to all of you in person.

253
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,000
Director Peng.

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,050
Quickly send someone

255
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,320
to bring that Qian guy back.

256
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,850
Okay, I'll call right away.

257
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,600
Director Peng,
well, Qin Feng, he...

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
Hurry up, the leaders are waiting.

259
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,690
Got it.

260
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,500
Got it.

261
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,550
If you had evidence in your hands,

262
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,350
why didn't you detain him on the spot?

263
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,640
I couldn't detain him that time.

264
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,090
Actually, I wanted
to give him an opportunity,

265
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,390
and also give myself

266
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,600
an opportunity to verify my judgment.

267
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,530
What do you mean?

268
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,560
Explain yourself clearly.

269
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,680
Director Ye.

270
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,170
Well, here is the thing.

271
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,480
If we go to the hospital today

272
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,010
and bring back Mr. Qian,

273
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,090
then this whole thing,
at most,

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
will be just a case
about violent debt collection.

275
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,520
But if

276
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,550
this Mr. Qian

277
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,050
can't be brought back,

278
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,440
and even vanishes

279
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,100
without a trace,

280
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,900
then the severity of this problem

281
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,750
becomes completely different.

282
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,670
[Retention Room]

283
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,660
Stop nagging. Why so many questions?

284
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,880
Hurry up. The directors are waiting.

285
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,130
[Office]

286
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:22,720
Ji.

287
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,290
[Newspaper Rack]

288
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:24,930
Ji.

289
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,480
Why did you come out?

290
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,770
I couldn't get a word in there.

291
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,540
I... I want to ask him
about the situation.

292
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,180
Wang Tao.

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,790
You had evidence.

294
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,450
Why didn't you say it earlier?

295
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,080
Director Ye just arrived today.

296
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,200
Aren't you just playing games with him?

297
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Sorry, Captain Zhong.

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,480
This was our only option.

299
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,840
Zhong.

300
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,840
You've seen everything.

301
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,790
It's obvious.

302
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,270
Someone is deliberately trying
to smear us.

303
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:52,960
Ji.

304
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,600
Well, I don't mean to criticize you.

305
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
But look at Qin Feng's behavior.

306
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,790
You shouldn't have

307
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,360
recommended him as a station chief.

308
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,870
Wait.

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,530
What's wrong with Qin Feng?

310
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,510
Explain yourself.

311
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,390
What is it? Speak.

312
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,910
What an attitude.

313
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,260
Ignore him.

314
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,640
Qin Feng is quite something.

315
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,890
He's becoming much more calculated
in how he handles things.

316
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,890
That's because he learned from you.

317
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,870
I guess it won't be a big deal.

318
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,610
Director Ye is his mentor.

319
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,300
Let's go.

320
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,460
Let's have a smoke.

321
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,490
I didn't bring any cigarettes.

322
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,550
Do you have a light?

323
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,750
Lin.

324
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,710
Mr. Ma.

325
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,880
That Mr. Qian

326
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,590
must be eliminated.

327
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,790
Take care of him.

328
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,780
[Lin, Ma Jin's personal bodyguard]

329
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,690
Yes, Mr. Ma.

330
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,360
I never expected he would
secretly record a video this time.

331
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,270
Yes.

332
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,010
I blew it.

333
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,730
I didn't manage to trap Qin Feng.

334
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,030
But at least we gave him a hard time,

335
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,600
right?

336
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,350
It's like a shot across the bow.

337
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,140
A shot across the bow?

338
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,840
This time, you basically
handed them a weapon against us.

339
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,120
Well, don't we still have the leader
to back us up?

340
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,580
Is the leader your father?

341
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,790
Even if he were your real father,

342
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,720
he can't always clean up your mess.

343
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,940
Mr. Ma, have some tea.
The temperature is just right.

344
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,080
The thing with the fake police uniforms

345
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,270
definitely leaked.

346
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,870
Tell those two guys
who work for you to lay low for a while.

347
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,390
Got it.

348
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,790
Is this Tan mutton I smell?

349
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,360
Why didn't you tell me
you were having meat?

350
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,720
Like you're short on this stuff.

351
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Have a seat.

352
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,030
Okay.

353
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,370
So successful at such a young age.

354
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,720
Bole Finance—

355
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,790
you're doing well with it.

356
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,150
It's mainly because

357
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,200
[Song Hao, Wang Xu's son-in-law,
Bole Finance's General Manager]

358
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,440
I've learned a lot from Mr. Ma.

359
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,500
Look at his emotional intelligence.

360
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,550
Mr. Wang, how did you
train him?

361
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,120
Share your experience with us.

362
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,720
Alright, stop praising him.

363
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,620
He'll get too full of himself.

364
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,960
His only advantage

365
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,980
is that he's willing to learn.

366
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,780
Luo.

367
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,320
You young people should

368
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
spend more time
communicating with each other.

369
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,320
When you encounter problems,

370
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,050
you can discuss them together.

371
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,010
Got it, Mr. Wang.

372
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,680
Alright.

373
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,510
I need to have

374
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,580
a private chat with Mr. Ma.

375
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,620
Mr. Qian's matter

376
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,010
was a complete blunder.

377
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,320
It was Luo who did it, right?

378
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,320
Don't worry.

379
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,480

Hu Xiaoyue's body is barely cold,

382
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,690
and now you're going after Qin Feng.

383
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,720
What are you thinking?

384
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,730
I never expected his disciples

385
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,220
would be so hot-tempered.

386
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,730
You know, birds of a feather
flock together.

387
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,550
You should have been prepared for this.

388
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,750
My thinking is,

389
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,480
"The best defense is a good offense."

390
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,120
Social relationships

391
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,010
are about concession,

392
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,210
not competition.

393
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,560
I just don't understand

394
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,030
what Ye Tianyou is thinking.

395
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,360
He's about to retire,

396
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,560
but insists on messing with
these troubled matters here.

397
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,260
Let me be frank with you.

398
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,400
You've fallen
right into Hu Xiaoyue's trap.

399
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,240
You think it was you
who drove Hu Xiaoyue to his death?

400
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,740
No, he just died to make a statement,

401
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,620
so that

402
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,380
his mentor would get involved,

403
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,550
creating a way to get to you.

404
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,400
This matter
is getting bigger and bigger now.

405
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,290
Ye Tianyou has been watching us

406
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,000
from the outside all these years.

407
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,820
Hu Xiaoyue's suicide

408
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,550
handed him a weapon against us.

409
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,510
We've basically delivered ourselves
to his doorstep.

410
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,720
Mr. Wang, my old friend.

411
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,440
Why do I feel

412
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
you're getting more and more timid?

413
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,030
I'm just being cautious.

414
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,109
Take your time eating. I'm leaving.

415
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,160
[Retention Room]

416
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,920
Come on.

417
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,310
Make way.

418
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,430
Director Ye.

419
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,860
As soon as our people left,

420
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,710
that Qian guy

421
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,110
ran away using the medical check-up

422
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,990
as an excuse.

423
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,160
We couldn't find him.

424
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,360
We called him,

425
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,710
but couldn't reach him.

426
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
Expand the search area.

427
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,130
Send people to keep looking.

428
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,130
You must find him.

429
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,730
Okay.

430
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,780
Wait.

431
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
You go personally and lead the team.

432
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,690
You must bring him back!

433
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,930
Yes, right away.

434
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,890
Right away!

435
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,600
[Retention Room]

436
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,160
Come on.

437
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,000
Alright.

438
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,170
Everyone return to your units.

439
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,750
Let's go.

440
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,330
[Retention Room]

441
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,680
Qin Feng.

442
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,230
Here.

443
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You've been on the force a long time.

444
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,690
Administrative authority,

445
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,110
search parameters,

446
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,160
investigation procedures—

447
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,240
you know all this.

448
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,070
Yes.

449
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,260
Let me tell you,

450
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,630
if anything happens to this Qian guy,

451
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,720
you'll be held responsible.

452
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,810
Naive.

453
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,490
If you keep being so reckless,

454
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,830
you're going to cause serious trouble.

455
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,510
Haven't you
caused enough problems already?

456
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes, sir.

457
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,890
Director Peng.

458
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,350
I'll admit my mistakes first.

459
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,350
I did overstep

460
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,030
in certain aspects

461
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,230
of certain cases.

462
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,250
That was wrong of me.

463
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,190
But regarding this incident with Mr. Qian,

464
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,620
before I went there,

465
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,080
I truly didn't expect him
to act like this.

466
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,270
I never anticipated

467
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,110
that he would go to such extremes

468
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,840
and do something so desperate.

469
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,590
I couldn't arrest him at that moment.

470
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,480
The public was watching.

471
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,360
If I had arrested him on the spot,

472
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,680
it would have sparked public controversy

473
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,610
and played right into their hands.

474
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,030
Leaders,

475
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,570
look, I'm just a station chief.

476
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,520
The matters I usually handle

477
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,390
aren't that significant.

478
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,920
But I always feel like

479
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,710
I'm surrounded on all sides.

480
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,600
Look,

481
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,580
this incident today—

482
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,680
you have all witnessed it.

483
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,040
These people...

484
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,130
To frame me,

485
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,540
he even dared to jump off a building.

486
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,600
He even had no regard for his own life.

487
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,190
Every day after work,

488
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,210
I rush home.

489
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,550
I'm afraid

490
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,960
someone might suddenly appear halfway

491
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,640
and stab me.

492
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,750
I couldn't handle that, either.

493
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,350
I'm not trying to play the victim here
with you leaders.

494
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,620
We have

495
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,940
bloody examples

496
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,360
right in front of us,

497
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,200
right?

498
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,540
Look, my....

499
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,550
my junior,

500
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,100
Hu Xiaoyue.

501
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,510
He is gone now.

502
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,520
But his case is still pending.

503
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
His CI,

504
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,140
to this day,

505
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
is still missing,

506
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,530
fate unknown.

507
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,180
Hu Xiaoyue was my junior.

508
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,120
I care about his case more than anyone.

509
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,530
I've been staring at this case every day—

510
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,790
watching and waiting—

511
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,130
only to see that the bureau
hasn't even bothered

512
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,730
to send anyone after that CI.

513
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,470
I just don't understand

514
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,730
why this is happening.

515
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,510
So today, I...

516
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,740
I'd like to speak

517
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,750
just as a frontline officer

518
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,880
and ask you leaders

519
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,570
for a straight answer:

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
What is the case disposition

521
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,640
of Hu Xiaoyue's case,

522
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,700
and what is the final determination?

523
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,790
Sit down.

524
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,180
Sit.

525
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,110
Yes, sir.

526
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,240
Qin Feng.

527
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,880
This matter has already been reported.

528
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,880
It means the Bureau
has already reached a conclusion.

529
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,600
Isn't that right, Yan?

530
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,330
This conclusion

531
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,760
was determined at our meeting.

532
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,100
It was likely a suicide case.

533
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,040
I've already reviewed the report.

534
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,580
I'll add my signature later.

535
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,480
The conclusion
that Hu Xiaoyue committed suicide

536
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,790
is legally sound.

537
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,780
There's nothing more to discuss
about this.

538
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,180
Also,

539
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,510
the CI matter

540
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,800
Qin Feng just mentioned—

541
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,770
what's going on with that?

542
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,230
Did you fail to find him,

543
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,630
or did you not even look?

544
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,840
And,

545
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,120
regarding this CI case,

546
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,830
is it being filed separately,

547
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,330
or is it attached to

548
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
Hu Xiaoyue's case?

549
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,450
Director Ye.

550
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,630
Captain Zhong has reported this to me.

551
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
It is likely attached

552
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,710
to Hu Xiaoyue's case.

553
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,180
Attached?

554
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,510
Then why didn't I see it in the report?

555
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,890
Director Ye,

556
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,000
to be honest,

557
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,460
with such a major incident in our bureau,

558
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,200
I bear responsibility.

559
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,800
As the supervising leader,

560
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,370
I must reflect on this.

561
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,690
I must conduct
a thorough self-examination.

562
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,560
To be frank with you,

563
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,430
I've barely slept these past few days.

564
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,380
Please rest assured,

565
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,720
after we return,

566
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
we'll immediately hold a meeting,

567
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,580
file it as a separate case,

568
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,780
and investigate it thoroughly.

569
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,520
Who do you plan
to put in charge of this case?

570
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,000
Regarding the candidate,

571
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,940
after Hu Xiaoyue's passing,

572
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,400
his position has remained vacant.

573
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,480
We've been considering
and observing

574
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,280
the officer from
the Criminal Investigation Detachment...

575
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,160
This case is very special.

576
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,350
I think appointing someone from
within the detachment

577
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,430
is inappropriate.

578
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,590
I suggest appointing someone
from outside.

579
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,550
Director Ye.

580
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,840
Director Ye,

581
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,600
you're a veteran investigator.

582
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,400
You know,

583
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,860
the criminal investigation work
requires strong expertise.

584
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,780
Outsiders are suitable
for administrative work,

585
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,480
but for investigating cases,
isn't it a bit...

586
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,400
inappropriate?

587
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,960
I mean, bringing someone from outside,

588
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,070
not an amateur.

589
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,640
Qian's disappearance

590
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
is an extremely serious matter.

591
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,920
We must select someone decisive,

592
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,620
in their prime,

593
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,780
with solid professional skills.

594
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,680
Qin Feng.

595
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,400
Here.

596
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,770
You've made such a big scene.

597
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,670
Isn't it because you want
to investigate this case yourself?

598
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,220
Director Ye,

599
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,090
I really didn't mean that.

600
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,150
I just...

601
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,190
I just wanted to find an opportunity

602
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,240
to report

603
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,220
the details I've gathered

604
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,560
to all the leaders in person.

605
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,020
I had no other intentions.

606
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,840
You've set up the stage

607
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,790
and put all of us on it.

608
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,250
Now you don't want to perform?

609
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,490
Let me tell you.

610
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,440
Since you've started,
you must finish the show.

611
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,970
You know better than anyone

612
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,830
that being the First Squad Captain

613
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,940
is very dangerous.

614
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,720
There are traps

615
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,030
and mines

616
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,160
all around them.

617
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,880
One wrong move
and they'll be blown to bits.

618
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,680
That's right.

619
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,870
Who do you think
is suitable for this position?

620
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,210
Well...

621
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,440
I think this position

622
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,870
carries great responsibility.

623
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,200
After all,

624
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,410
it was previously

625
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,880
Hu Xiaoyue's position.

626
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,070
He was my junior.

627
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,260
It's not appropriate for me to take it.

628
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,240
But regarding Xiaoyue's case,

629
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,880
I would definitely take it seriously.

630
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,980
I would spare no effort,

631
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,590
be completely committed,

632
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,250
and investigate thoroughly.

633
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,880
But I still need
to think about it.

634
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,690
The specific candidate

635
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,440
should be carefully considered

636
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,500
by all the leaders.

637
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,710
The bureau leadership

638
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,030
is in complete agreement.

639
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,720
Yes, sir.

640
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,350
[Gaoxin Police Station]

641
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,550
No, no, no.

642
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,200
Absolutely not.

643
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,460
Isn't this just a trap?

644
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,480
That's not right.

645
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,310
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

646
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,160
If he becomes the First Squad Captain,

647
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,090
investigating the case
will be much easier,

648
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:50,610
right?

649
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,200
The investigation will indeed be easier,

650
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,800
but don't you care
if he gets dragged into this?

651
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,350
If someone has to go, you go yourself.

652
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,590
Well, what are you talking about?

653
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,510
If I could go,

654
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,640
you two wouldn't
be involved in this at all.

655
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,440
Look, let's not argue

656
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,830
about whether to go

657
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,310
or not.

658
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,820
The point is,
if you want to investigate this,

659
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,830
you have to be there.

660
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,750
How else are you going
to find anything out if you don't go?

661
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,230
No.

662
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,650
Think again.

663
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
What is there to think about?

664
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,350
Don't we need
to investigate Xiaoyue's case

665
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,160
thoroughly?

666
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,880
We didn't have the authority
to investigate it before.

667
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,030
Under what capacity
were we supposed to investigate?

668
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,790
Let me tell you this.

669
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,070
I overreached before,

670
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,610
and the leadership
already took issue with it.

671
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,640
If I'm there,

672
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,750
the case will
be thoroughly investigated.

673
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,640
Don't worry.

674
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,160
Well,

675
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,830
the worst outcome is

676
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,240
that I get transferred back
to the police station.

677
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,680
And if I can't,

678
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,100
I'll take your shift instead.

679
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,770
That makes sense.

680
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,440
Come on.

681
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,740
Just go for it.

682
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,940
I've got your back.

683
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,620
Can you two
stop acting so recklessly together?

684
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,720
You know clearly
how many issues

685
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,810
are involved in it.

686
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,550
If he can take you down once,
he can do it again.

687
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,310
This is a fight between big shots.

688
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,680
We can't get involved.

689
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,560
I won't get involved in it.

690
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,270
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

691
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,110
Just taking a look would be fine, right?

692
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,450
Let me find out
which big shot is involved.

693
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,550
That makes sense.

694
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,320
But,

695
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,350
so what if they're big shots?

696
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,350
These so-called big shots are nothing.

697
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,070
One punch
and they'll be flat on their backs, too.

698
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,000
Why are you picking fights
with the big shots?

699
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,960
That's all I'm saying.

700
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,270
Mai, Mai, I'm begging you.

701
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,200
Stop stirring things up, will you?

702
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Anyway, I don't agree with this.

703
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,940
If you really want to go,

704
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,620
then take me with you.

705
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,640
Take you?

706
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,240
Look, I'm being transferred back there,

707
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,070
right?

708
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,960
What would you even be doing there?

709
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
Didn't you say it yourself?

710
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,350
You're the gas pedal. I'm the brake.

711
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,400
When have brakes and gas pedals
ever been separated?

712
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,840
Come on. With all those issues at home?

713
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,790
Think it through before you talk.

714
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,190
I've thought it through.

715
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,070
You're being impulsive.

716
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,680
Exactly.

717
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Are you not going to tell your wife?

718
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
Aren't you afraid of her?

719
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,680
My wife?

720
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,140
I just need to let her know.

721
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,600
I take care of things outside the house.

722
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,230
Drink less.
Even too much tea can go to your head.

723
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,210
It's this building.

724
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,300
Mr. Ma.

725
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,400
Mr. Wen, Mr. Liu, you two
are so hard to get a hold of.

726
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
What do you want?

727
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
I checked the almanac

728
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,540
and specifically
chose this auspicious day.

729
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,450
Let's get this done today.

730
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,750
Tianye, Yong.

731
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,310
We're all on the same side.

732
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,200
Let me speak from the heart today.

733
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,710
Look at this place.

734
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,540
This is the center of Han Port.

735
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,590
In the future,

736
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,270
it will be the economic engine
of the entire Hanzhou,

737
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,920
right?

738
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,080
Signing the contract will benefit

739
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
both Ping'an Town

740
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,330
and Longwan Village.

741
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,590
No need for empty talk.

742
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,450
We know why you called us here.

743
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,960
Liu Tianye—

744
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,430
Madam Wen's son,

745
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:48,970
right?

746
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,960
Yes.

747
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,080
Do you know who I am?

748
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,050
Then things will be simple.

749
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,140
I'm getting old.

750
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,920
I don't want to complicate matters

751
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,230
that can be resolved with money.

752
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
I've heard about you.

753
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,480
I like your style, kid.

754
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,940
So I've decided

755
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,660
