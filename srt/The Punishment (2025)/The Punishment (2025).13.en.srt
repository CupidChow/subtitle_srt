Dealing with him

206
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,410
is just a piece of cake.

It's not difficult.

208
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,690
I found it out.

209
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,120
When he was drunk,

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,100
I checked his dashcam.

211
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,840
There's an abandoned building
in the western suburbs.

Every time he goes,

214
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,030
he carries a lot of water and food.

215
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,670
I guess whoever's hiding there
is either Luo Bo

216
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,550
or Song Hao.

217
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,450
Alright. I'll drive you home.

I won't care about Song Hao anymore.

My ancestors

238

made a living by hunting.

239
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,790
But they had

240
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,240
an unwritten rule.

241
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,720
Never hunt injured prey.

242
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,270
In spring,

243
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,790
never hunt pregnant prey.

244
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,670
Take wolves for example.

245
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,240
You don't touch their cubs.

246
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,320
If you touch their cubs,

247
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,120
they'll fight you to the death.

248
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,120
Mr. Wang.

249
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,320
I understand what you mean.

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Actually,
you should know that all these years,

251
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,270
I've never had any designs

252
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,870
on any member of your family,

253
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,000
except only on Song Hao now.

254
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,750
Because he knows too much.

255
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,670
Rest assured.

Aren't you worried something might happen?

265
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,170

if we leave others a way out,

277
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,210
it's like
walking ourselves into a dead end.

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000

entrust this to you.

289
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,980
help make things clear to you.

290
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Song Hao's problem is very serious.

you take the child and run away with him,

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,300

00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,710
They are the connections
made over the years, right?

568
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,630
You can't afford to mess with any of them.

569
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,360
Understand?

570
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,440
Shut up!

571
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,210
I'll take a closer look.

572
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Turn the page.

573
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,250
I think we should give this to Feng.

574
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,530
I'm sure he knows what to do.

575
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:41,550
Tianye,

576
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,170
the Public Security Bureau is just ahead.

00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,630

579
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:03,770
Tianye.

580
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,840
That ledger—

581
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,170
he carried it with him to protect himself.

582
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,850
This is a bargaining chip
heaven-sent for us.

583
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,230
We still need to climb higher.

584
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,440
We can't hand it over
to the Public Security Bureau.
