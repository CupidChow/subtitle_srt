00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,560
Alright.

00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,960
Let's serve two plates for now
—let's eat, Mai.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,390

[Hanzhou City; 2002]

00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,800
You go ahead.
There's still one more plate here.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,960
Come to the table; everyone's hungry.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,290
Xiaoyue, come to the table. Stop reading.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,400
Senior Feng,

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,120
in Xu Li's teacher's statement, it says

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,550
Xu Li was picked up by a relative

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,000
after getting drunk.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,350
Who exactly is that person?

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,440
Who knows?

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,070
Xu Li herself blacked out.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,040
Right now, whatever her teacher says goes.

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,230
But judging by her teacher's attitude,

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,500
she's probably lying.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,920
She's definitely lying.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
Xiaoyue, time to eat.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,280
Got it.

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,880
How can you tell?

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,560
How can I tell?

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,650
It's simple.

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,350
A university teacher

25
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,320
taking students to a competition should,

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,280
by all accounts,

27
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,790
protect her students,

28
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,280
right?

29
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,280
Xu Li got drunk and lost consciousness,

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,150
then was picked up
by a so-called "relative"

31
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,950
without the teacher
even verifying his identity.

32
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,560
Isn't that suspicious?

33
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,590
Also,

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
during the questioning,

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,039
I felt she was really nervous.

36
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
When we showed her

37
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,150
the suspect sketch
based on Xu Li's description,

38
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,080
she immediately

39
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,760
said she didn't recognize it—

40
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,870
almost like she was avoiding something.

41
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,000
Isn't that strange?

42
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,900
So the teacher is in cahoots.

43
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,680
Whether she's involved or not,

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,560
at the very least, a normal person

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,620
looking at a sketch

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,200
would at least examine it

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,150
carefully

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,710
and try to recall—

49
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
but she's different.

50
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,680
The moment she saw it, she immediately
said it wasn't him.

51
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,509
There's definitely something wrong here.

52
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,710
If she's in on it,

53
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,590
we need to keep a close eye on her.

54
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,350
This kind of thing
probably isn't her first time.

55
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,680
What if she's being coerced?

56
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,050
Then whoever's behind her

57
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,210
must be quite capable.

58
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,039
So,

59
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,950
we need to have a good talk with her,

60
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,130
including those students.

61
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,680
The most crucial thing now

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
is to find the person in that sketch.

63
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,430
No matter what kind of troublemaker
is behind her,

64
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,560
we'll take him down.

65
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,020
You've still got
that youthful drive, Boss.

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,730
We'll handle it—

67
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,270
everything that needs doing will get done.

68
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,150
But first, you've got to eat your fill
at this hot pot meal

69
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,680

This is Boss Mai—

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,310
the one I mentioned to you before.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,260
I brought him along today
to play a couple of rounds.

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,480
Search him.

has been blocked.

My CI will send a message soon.

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,000

Still no sign of those two?

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,720
They probably know you're watching them,

98

Come on.

124
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,200
I need a small favor.

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
What is it? Tell me.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
My luck's been terrible tonight.
I haven't won a single hand.

127
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,040
How about

128
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,870
lending me a bit more

129
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,570
so I can turn things around?

131
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,360
you've borrowed a lot tonight already.

132
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,300
How will you pay it back?

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,520
I'll pay with my life if I have to.

134
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,890
Isn't this how you run a gambling den?

but won't let me try to win it back?

137
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,360
Of course you can.

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,830

before taking action.

155
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,600
Report.

200,000 my ass!

160
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,390
I lost all that money because of you!

161
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,990
I have no money, just my life.

162
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,230
Not paying?

163
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,390
Take him

164
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,420

show me what it's like.

don't back down now.

at the mountain road intersection.

377
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,590
Qin...

378
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,750
You're Qin Feng, right?

379
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,030
Yes, Qin Feng.

380
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,550
I've heard about you.

381
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Xiaoyue mentioned me to you, right?

382
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,160
I...

383
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,350
I was also tricked into
taking out a loan from them.

384
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,080
Afterward, I reported it to the police.

385
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,030
Captain Hu found me

386
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,710
and said he would help me.

387
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
That's why I agreed

388
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,110
to be his CI.

389
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,460
He seemed to be investigating

390
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,280
something about
fake police officers back then.

391
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,790
I never expected things
would turn out like this.

392
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,040
Officer Qin,

393
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,030
it's not that I don't trust you.

394
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,310
I'm afraid you

395
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,160
might get implicated too.

396
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,960
Now you've made me

397
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,200
quite curious.

398
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,300
What kind of matter

399
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,880
could implicate me?

400
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,030
Or do you think we

401
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,090
can't handle this kind of situation?

402
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,600
Do you have something?

403
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,880
I have a video.

404
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
If it weren't for this video,

405
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,420
I wouldn't be alive today.

406
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,930
I was planning to give it
to Captain Hu before.

407
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
But then he...

408
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,490
He was fine and then he just...

409
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,290
What's in the video?

410
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,410
I have a condition.

411
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,270
Go ahead.

412
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,640
I want

413
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,830
the leaders
of the Public Security Bureau present

414
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,430
before I hand over the video.

415
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
You want the leaders
of the Municipal Bureau present?

416
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,050
What do you mean

417
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,440
by that?

418
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,540
Do you think

419
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,350
our rank isn't high enough,

420
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,520
or are you worried
we won't handle it properly?

421
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,210
Because the person I filmed

422
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,920

is one of your
Public Security Bureau leaders.

424

425
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,640
involves one of our bureau leaders,

426
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,070
fine.

427
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,310

428
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,070
was it just a chance encounter,

429
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,350
or were they having a meal together?

430
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,960
I need to know.

431
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,690
They wanted to kill Captain Hu.

432
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,960
Alright.

433
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,590
Okay.

434
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,590

in your phone video?

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,240
During that time,

and bullying my parents.

460
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,700
I got more and more angry.

461
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,000
I just wanted

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,630
to find a chance

to get back at him.

464
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,960
I knew where he usually parked his car.

465
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,070
So I grabbed a wrench

466
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,720
and planned to hide underneath it,

469
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,830
But then...

470
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,480
Then I ended up

471
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,640
witnessing him

472
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,850
meeting someone.

474
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,680

to record

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,400
their conversation.

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,500
It was raining heavily

that day,

479
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,690
and there was a lot of noise too.

480
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,000
Later, I tried some noise reduction

481
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,330
on my computer,

482
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,710
but the result wasn't great.

483
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,110
So I

484
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,290
called Captain Hu.

485
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,360
He said the police tech could handle it.

486
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,960
But I never expected

487
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,800
that before we could even meet,

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,110

to hide the phone's memory card

let's go. I'm treating.

567
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,960
You can't find the evidence
and now you're sulking at me?

568
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
No, it's not that.

569
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,400
I checked the surveillance footage too.

570
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,480
The power was cut off

571
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,410
just 10 minutes before we arrived.

572
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,440
Who could have been faster than us?

573
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,170
You know what I'm trying to say.

574
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,510
Interesting.

575
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,030
Who could it be?

576
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,770
There's no one else?

577
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,110
Don't ask me. How would I know?

578
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,650
Leave your bag in my office.

579
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,510
Now, let me hear

580
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,750
your thoughts.

581
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,270
Director Ye,

582
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,330
here's how I see it.

583
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,510
First,

584
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,750
no one has ever seen

585
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,610
the video Wang Ming mentioned.

586
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,000
It's only his word.

587
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,000
Second,

588
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
even if such a video did exist,

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,720
it could've been lost

590
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,580
or taken long

591
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,790
before Wang Tao and the team got there.

592
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,380
However, we can't rule out

593
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,940
the possibility of an information leak.

594
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,650
If that's the case, it's a serious matter

595
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,750
that needs thorough investigation.

596
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,160
How do we investigate this?

597
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,750
Besides,

598
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,160
who's going to investigate
is also a question.

599
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,020
That depends on

600
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,900
Director Ye's arrangements.

601
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,210
I think the urgent priority now

602
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,370
is to find a breakthrough

603
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,270
from the suspects we've arrested.

604
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,680
Let's not jump to conclusions
about whether the video exists,

605
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,200
but if we do find it,

606
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,170
it would corroborate
Wang Ming's statement.

607
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,100
Captain Zhong,

608
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,790
what's your opinion?

609
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,160
I also think

610
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,510
it's more important
to interrogate those suspects first.

611
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,350
Also,

612
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,680
we should have someone re-interview

613
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,000
the victim.

614
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,290
There might be other clues we can uncover.

615
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,200
Interrogate them as soon as possible.

616
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,920
Yes.

617
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,650
Director Ye.

618
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,900
Have a seat.

619
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,670
Do you have something to say?

620
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,450
Director Ye,

621
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,590
Wang Ming's place

622
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,470
originally had surveillance cameras.

623
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,400
But someone

624
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,510
cut off the power in advance.

625
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
And whoever went there

626
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,790
went straight for
where he hid the memory card.

627
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,920
What does this mean?

628
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,050
Isn't this clearly a leak?

629
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,980
We have a problem inside our department.

630
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,720
I think it's time to tell you now.

631
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,350
Here.

632
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,750
Mentor,

633
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,510
I'm sorry.

634
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,440
I've made up my mind.

635
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,170
I can only use this clumsy method.

636
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,520
I believe after you hear me out,

637
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,210
you'll understand why I did this,

638
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,510
right?

639
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
Ma Jin and Luo Bo

640
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,120
have committed so many crimes.

641
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,780
I've been investigating them
for a long time.

642
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,760
I've tried many approaches.

643
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,650
But every lead I follow ends up nowhere.

644
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,280
Ends up nowhere.

645
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,880
Now even my informant has disappeared.

646
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,260
Because Ma Jin has
many powerful people behind him.

647
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,200
The entire network of connections

648
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,500
in Hanzhou

649
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,260
is like a web,

650
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,730
and right now I'm trapped in it.

651
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,680
I can't break free

652
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,380
or make any progress.

653
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,370
They're targeting me now,

654
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,710
threatening me,

655
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
harassing my family,

656
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
smearing my reputation,

657
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,620
and now they've suspended me.

658
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,909
They just don't want me investigating.

659
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,750
Ma Jin has people inside the department.

660
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,710
I know that once I'm gone,

661
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
these cases will sink to the bottom,

662
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,170
never to be looked into again.

663
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,400
I don't have Senior Hongchao's
relentless drive

664
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,110
or Senior Feng's cleverness.

665
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,659
But I remember what you taught us:

666
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,540
when ordinary people have troubles,

667
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,150
they can only rely on us police officers.

668
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
If we don't help them,

669
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,700
no one will.

670
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,720
There are so many victims

671
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,750
who shouldn't be forgotten.

672
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,190
Since they want me on my knees,

673
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,890
I'll make a big scene instead.

674
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
I'll use my life

675
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,480
to tear open a gap

676
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,440
and light a fire.

677
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,620
The evidence against Jinding Group

678
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,160
will be sent to you along with this video.

679
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Please tell Senior Hongchao

680
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,630
and Senior Feng that I'm sorry.

681
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,080
I had to do this.

682
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,330
I had to do this.

683
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,890
I leave my parents in their care.

684
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,630
After Xiaoyue's incident,

685
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,990
I received the digital camera he sent me.

686
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,110
The reason I didn't tell you

687
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,440
was because the case wasn't resolved yet.

688
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,630
Also, like you,

689
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,150
I needed time to process this.

690
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,830
Who exactly wanted to

691
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,030
transfer Xiaoyue away back then?

692
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,330
The city bureau.

693
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,680
An anonymous report

694
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,190
accused

695
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,230
Hu Xiaoyue of taking bribes.

696
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
He didn't tell you

697
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,200
probably because

698
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,710
he didn't want

699
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,000
to drag you into it.

700
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:04,880
Qin Feng,

701
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,890
you need to keep playing your part.

702
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,130
Understood.

703
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,230
Should we inform

704
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,400
Lao Mai about Xiaoyue's situation?

705
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,030
Tell him.

706
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,750
He deserves an answer.

707
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,460
[Inquiry Room 3]

708
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,030
That won't help.

709
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,920
He's a hard nut.

710
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,880
He only admitted
to violent debt collection

711
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
and denied everything else.

712
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,920
What about the police uniform issue?

713
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,190
He claimed Xiaoyue gave it to him,

714
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,110
just won't admit Luo Bo's

715
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,190
involvement.

716
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,620
As it stands, our evidence
is indeed lacking.

717
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,400
Crazy,

718
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
it looks like we'll have to let

719
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,910
Luo Bo go for now.

720
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,810
Please answer the question I just asked.

721
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,630
Officer, I can see you're
truly dedicated to your job.

722
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,960
How much do you make in a month?

723
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't ask me about my salary.

724
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
Fix your attitude.

725
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,840
Answer my previous question.

726
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,000
You're so diligent.

727
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,280
You're much better than
those useless people working for me.

728
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Listen, Officer,

729
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,510
quit your job.

730
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,280
Come work for me.

731
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,110
I'll pay you triple your salary.

732
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:21,920
Let me tell you,

733
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,120
the benefits are much better than here.

734
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,230
Captain Qin,

735
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,230
are you trying to poach my staff?

736
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,490
You've got some nerve.

737
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,900
I just appreciate talent.

738
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,690
This guy is really dedicated.

739
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Well,

740
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,670
Scar has confessed everything.

741
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,360
He's the one who kidnapped them.

742
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,090
He collected all the money too.

743
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,830
You had nothing to do with it.

744
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,280
Thank you, Captain Qin,
for seeing things clearly.

745
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,420
We made a mistake.

746
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,810
We misunderstood you.

747
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,360
But your little friend

748
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,590
probably won't be

749
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,000
getting out anytime soon.

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,600
Take good care of his family.

751
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,310
Captain Qin, he's not my friend.

752
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,510
He's just a regular employee
at our company.

753
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,460
But don't worry.

754
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,670
I'll definitely take care of his family.

755
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,870
I'm actually curious about something.

756
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,440
Someone as capable as Scar

757
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,530
is still working for you.

758
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,170
You must have some powerful connections.

759
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,920
It's not about connections.

760
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
It's just that our company's benefits

761
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,160
really are that good.

762
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,960
I see.

763
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,210
Captain Qin,

764
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,360
have you ever thought about

765
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,630
coming to work for me?

766
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,800
If you join us,

767
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,440
you can name your price,

768
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,330
alright?

769
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,000
I'd be afraid to take the job.

770
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,200
I might end up messing things up for you.

771
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,410
Alright.

772
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,000
Return all of Mr. Luo's

773
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,230
watch, chains,

774
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
belts—

775
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
whatever.

776
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,750
Let him go.

777
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
-Okay.
-Thank you, Captain Qin.

778
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,630
That's it.

779
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,670
Untie him.

780
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,210
Take care, Captain Qin.

781
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,400
Was Mr. Qian kidnapped by Scar too?

782
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,630
Mr. Qian?

783
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,300
Who's that?

784
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,770
You don't know him?

785
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,100
No, I don't.

786
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,410
Better that you don't.

787
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,550
The less you know people
like him, the better.

788
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,350
It's trouble.

789
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,030
Yes.

790
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,210
Take care, Captain Qin.

791
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,280
Director Ye,

792
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,300
your meeting went on so long

793
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,320
[Hanzhou Public Security]

794
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,190
my legs have gone numb.

795
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,550
I can barely stand up.

796
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,030
Whether you stand or not isn't important.

797
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,090
It doesn't affect our conversation.

798
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,090
Do you need something from me?

799
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,670
Nothing.

800
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,710
Nothing at all.

801
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,200
I'm just here

802
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,590
to thank you.

803
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,920
As far as I recall, you and I

804
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,360
don't have any business dealings.

805
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,840
What are you thanking me for?

806
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,070
If you were in business like me,
I'd be out of a job.

807
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,200
I'd have gone back to farming long ago.

808
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
Both of our time is valuable.

809
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,150
Let's get to the point.

810
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,050
Well,

811
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,670
there's this group of criminals

812
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,280
who've been using the Jinding Group's name

813
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,760
to swindle people

814
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,190
and you've caught them.

815
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,310
That's great.

816
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,330
I came to thank you in person.

817
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,030
Well,

818
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,480
I'm not familiar with the details.

819
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,080
Police catching criminals

820
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,190
is just part of the job.

821
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,670
That's our job.

822
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,090
No need to thank me.

823
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,360
I have other matters to attend to.

824
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,090
Director Ye.

825
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,440
I...

826
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,590
There's one more thing I'd like to say.

827
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,230
It's...

828
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,120
Mr. Ma, is there something else?

829
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,710
I just wanted to mention—among that group,

830
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,110
there really are a few

831
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,170
who used to work at our Jinding Group,

832
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,190
but

833
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,590
they were fired long ago.

834
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,960
You should have said so earlier.

835
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,360
Why beat around the bush?

836
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,000
So you want me to make an exception.

837
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,960
No, no, no.

838
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,020
I just came to make my position clear.

839
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,710
Because these people are despicable.

840
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,510
They must be severely punished.

841
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,240
Give them the harshest sentence possible.

842
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,280
You want me to hand down harsh sentences.

843
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,840
Yes.

844
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,150
Is the Public Security Bureau

845
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,330
a tool for you and the Jinding Group
to settle scores?

846
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,670
How they are sentenced

847
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,840
is up to the court.

848
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,400
It's not something you and I
can decide with a few words.

849
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
Your thinking is flawed.

850
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,490
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Ma?

851
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,550
Yes, I think it's simple.

852
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,480
Excuse me.

853
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,410
Among these people,

854
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,400
there's someone named Luo Bo.

855
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,060
He's your relative, isn't he?

856
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,280
He's just a younger relative.

857
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,480
I was wondering

858
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,110
why you'd try to guide me
on how to handle this.

859
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,590
By reason or by sentiment,
that shouldn't be the case.

860
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,770
Maybe

861
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,630
you've got too much sway.

862
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,030
With so many connections
within the system,

863
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,760
you've probably grown used to it.

864
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,220
Actually, let me tell you,

865
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,000
within the system,

866
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,880
you and I have known
each other the longest—

867
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,400
we could be considered friends.

868
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,630
With others, it's just
a nod of acquaintance.

869
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,860
That's why I dare to

870
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,630
ask for favors sometimes.

871
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,030
Luo Bo is cleared.
He can be released today.

872
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,440
However, Mr. Ma,

873
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,440
we could possibly become anything,

874
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,380
except friends.

875
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,710
Why?

876
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,060
Because I'm not brave enough.

877
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,590
Being friends with you requires courage.

878
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,210
I'm leaving.

879
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,200
You're not brave enough?

880
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,760
If only you were really not brave.
