00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,920
disclose investigation progress
to the public soon,

376
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,590
so as to demonstrate our credibility

377
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,400
and also...

378
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,110
our sincerity.

Third,

respond

381
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,510
with decisive action.

382
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,680
The Municipal Bureau will fully cooperate

383
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,480
with all anti-smuggling operations.

384
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,950
We'll launch a formal investigation

385
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,210
on Longwan Logistics.

386
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,280
Besides,

387
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,170
as for what was mentioned about Qin Feng

388
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,170
and Wen Bo,

389
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,750
I suggest

390
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,140
they be

391
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,350
suspended.

392
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,590
Consider it a vacation for them.

393
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,050
When the results come out,

394
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,600
we'll discuss further.

395
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,450
Director Ye, what do you think?

396
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,270
[Hanzhou Public Security]

397
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,880
I agree.

398
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,480
Meeting adjourned.

399
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,350
-Captain Zhong.
-Captain Zhong.

400
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,750
What will happen to them?

401
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,060
Captain Zhong,

402
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
it's impossible.

403
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,290
The two of them are by no means
involved in any shady stuff.

404
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,810
We can all vouch for them.

405
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,110
That's right.

406
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,250
Wen Bo is such a good kid.

407
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,400
How could he have possibly taken bribes?

408
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,190
Someone's clearly trying to sabotage him!

409
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Rest assured.

410
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,310
I'll fight anyone

411
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,730
who's after him to the end.

412
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,460
I'm determined to protect him!

413
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,610
That's my word.

414
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,070
Also,

415
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,480
aren't there people
trying to obstruct our investigation?

416
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,430
Let's put as much effort as we can
into probing

417
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,630
till the truth is out!

418
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
If you need help, come to me anytime.

419
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,030
How dare anyone touches my people?

420
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,630
I'll show them what happens!

421
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,480
Is he...

422
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,610
really your mentor?

423
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
Yes, I guess.

424
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,270
Guys,

425
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,850
Captain Zhong has stepped up.

426
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,580
Look,

427
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,480
Bo often treated us to boba tea,

428
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,080
didn't he?

429
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,350
Captain Qin and Bo

430
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,750
are just temporarily away.

431
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,200
I believe justice will be restored

432
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,440
for them in time.

433
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,440
What should we do now?

434
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,550
Now, we should do as much as we can

435
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,220
to help them both weather through

436
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,750
these difficult times.

437
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,580
Can we do it?

438
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,730
Absolutely!

439
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,830
Let's get started!

440
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,440
Yes!

441
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,350
Impressive.

I know.

please stay for dinner.

450
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,110
Take a seat.

451
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,060
I'll go cook.

452
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,880
Just wait for 10 minutes.

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,390
Where are those...

pickles of yours? Serve some to Mentor.

Those are from ages ago.

They must've gone bad
as I was hospitalized for a long time.

457
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
I should throw them away.

458
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,560
I really mean it.

Tell me.

469
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
I didn't mean to have him do anything
for me

470
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,200
or chase him away.

471
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,870
I was just saying the pickles had gone bad

472
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,170
and might get him sick,

473
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,550
so we'd better serve him something better.

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,400

he was so stubborn?

Nothing serious.

Whoever comes after me

485
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,230
means he or she has a guilty conscience.

Don't think about that.

to make a soup that will help

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,490
with your recovery. Okay?

495
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,960

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,740
you've been too busy to talk to me lately.

502

I'd hate to add to your burden.

503
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,120
I want to do something to support you.

504
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,750
We said we'd find time to talk,

505
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
but there has never been a right moment.

506
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,570
You've been coming home later and later.

507
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,120
My mind inevitably wanders
while I wait for you alone.

508
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,160
I can't help but worry about you.

509
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,300
At this rate,

510
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I'll only make things worse for you.

511
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,490
I know you're hiding something from me.

512
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,850
But you wouldn't tell me anything.

513
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,750
In that case,

514
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,180
we should spend some time apart.

515
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,550
Let's wait till you settle
all issues at hand

516
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,350
before we discuss our problems.

517
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,510
Jiangyan,

518
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,370
have you seen Ziyi?

519
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,270
She said she'd stay at her brother's place
for a few days.

520
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,480
Did she not tell you?

521
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,020
She did.

522
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,720
She told me about it.

523
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,790
Tianye,

524
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,330
I want a word with you.

525
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,120
Come meet me at the old dock.

526
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,680
What can't you say to me at home?

527
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,410
Why come all the way to the dock?

528
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,880
Look.

529
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Those deserted fishing boats are ours,
right?

530
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,790
Yes, the ones we used to fish with.

531
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,240
See,

532
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,120
these are paired with them.

533
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,760
I never imagined

534
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,050
that one day we the Longwan people
would discard our boats.

535
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,170
There are bigger vessels now.

536
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,310
It's normal...

537
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,770
for these to be phased out.

538
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah.

539
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
Everything changes.

540
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,000
Vessels change. People change.

541
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,110
Changes take place all the time,

542
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,830
right?

543
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,590
Nobody else is around.

544
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,320
Just speak your mind.

545
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,010
I'm just wondering,

546
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,430
if nothing had happened to my family

547
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,490
and that my parents were still alive,

548
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,630
what my life would be like,
besides being free of hatred.

549
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,680
What's done cannot be undone.

550
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,680
Fate...

551
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,120
is not to be changed.

552
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,550
But we can prevent

553
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,080
bad things from happening.

554
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,240
How?

555
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,570
I heard someone took
the company's financial records,

556
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,100
claiming it to be my order.

557
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,200
Whoever did that

558
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,320
must have his or her own reason.

559
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,450
For prevention, I suppose.

560
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,110
I just hate for all of us

561
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,510
to end up drifting apart.

562
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,980

00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,910
Good to hear that.

754
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,440
Has Feng mentioned

755
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,530
Xu Li's case to you?

756
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,310
Xu Li...

757
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,200
I know about her case.

758
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,510
It was the exact reason
for Feng's transfer

759
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,970
to Gutang Police Station.

760
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,310
Xu Li and I

761
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,600
grew up together as friends.

762
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,780
I went with her to file the police report.

763
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,840
Come to think of it,

764
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,970
Feng and I have known

765
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,990
each other for quite a long time.

766
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,930
He and his fellows,

767
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,000
in my opinion,

768
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
are excellent police officers—

769
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,620
more dedicated than most others.

770
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,200
But I guess Longwan Logistics' matter

771
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,360
has caused much distress to Feng.

772
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,970
Given that, I'd say he's somewhat

773
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,820
affected.

774
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,030
If something comes up,

775
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,670
I'll contact you again.

776
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,890
No need to see me out.

777
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,630
Okay.

778
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,130
Take care, Ms. Leng.

779
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,810
How's Baoying doing at your place
during these days?

780
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
He's doing great.

781
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,160
Ziyi's with him.

782
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,030
Don't worry.

783
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,200
What are Ziyi and Tianye planning to do?

784
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,510
I don't know either.

785
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,680
My sister

786
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,500
has always been strong-minded.

787
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,600
She doesn't share everything
with her family.

788
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,490
I...

789
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,800
will ask her when I get a chance.

790
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,000
If Ziyi is determined to get a divorce,

791
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,470
I won't object to it,
though I'm her mother-in-law.

792
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,150
I'll respect her decision.

793
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,150
You actually know better than anyone

794
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,670
about everything that has happened

795
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,070
between Ziyi and Tianye.

796
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,610
We used to

797
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,320
hold loads of grudges against each other.

798
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,980
It was the fight against Ma Jin

799
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,430
that brought our two villages together.

800
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,160
During those difficult times,

801
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
you chose to collaborate with us

802
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,120
and offered much help to us.

803
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,420
I've always kept all that in mind.

804
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,200
Those hard times are finally behind us.

805
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,060
Everyone has money now.

806
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,200
But...

807
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,400
do they really think...

808
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,600
that money was earned fair and square?

809
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,240
Zhao Peng,

810
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,600
why did you partner with Longwan
in the first place?

811
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,350
Wasn't it to improve the villagers' lives?

812
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,620
But look at what you guys are doing now.

813
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,460
Is it really for the villagers' benefit?

814
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,150
You're their leader.

815
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,920
If you lose your way,

816
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,940
the villagers will end up going astray
along with you.

817
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,770
I must set things straight.

818
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,310
A shareholders' meeting
will be held in a few days.

819
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,040
I hope to have your support.

820
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,460
Jiangyan.
