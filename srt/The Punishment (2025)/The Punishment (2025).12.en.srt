00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,320
always fighting

192
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
and wanting more.

193
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,360
We only wanted to live in peace.

194
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,550
Tianye.

195
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,320
Tianye!

196
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,480
Tianye, are you okay?

197
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,280
Tianye!

198
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,180
Are you alright?

199
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,260
Let's go to the hospital.

200
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,590
Tianye!

201
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,660
Tianye.

202
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,690
Tianye.

203
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,710
Why did you drink so much?

204
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,600
Tianye.

205
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,200
Are you okay?

206
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,210
Tianye.

207
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,550
Where are you going?

208
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,150
What are you looking for?

209
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,190
Are you out of your mind?

210
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,340
How can you take medicine
right after drinking?

211
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,510
It hurts.

212
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,030
Tianye,

213
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,900
eat something first.

214
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,060
Then you can take your medicine, okay?

215
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,440
Stop drinking!

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,750
Leave me alone!

217
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,750
Just ignore me, okay?

218
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,570
Your brother died because of me!

219
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,270
Do you understand?

220
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,350
It was all my fault!

221
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,370
Why do you even care about me?

222
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,510
I see you as a brother too!

223
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,790
Just leave me alone, all of you!

224
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,890
Let me drink myself to death, okay?

225
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,040
What's the use in doing this?

226
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,270
What's wrong?

227
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,420
He's trying to take medicine
after drinking.

228
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,760
Keep an eye on him!

229
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,110
Tianye.

230
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,380
Don't do this.

231
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,550
Feng.

232
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,230
I got Jiangyong killed.

233
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,830
Jiangyong died because of me...

234
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,370
Tianye.

235
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,480
It wasn't your fault.
Don't blame yourself.

236
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,280
It wasn't you.

237
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,980
You didn't do it, Tianye.

238
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,650
Don't blame yourself, okay?

239
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,960
You didn't do it.

240
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,570
I did...

241
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,880
I...

242
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,540
I'm a sinner!

243
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,310
You didn't do it, Tianye.

244
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,640
It was Luo Bo and the others
who got him killed. It's not your fault.

245
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Why didn't you arrest Luo Bo?

246
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,200
Arrest him!

247
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,240
I...

248
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,900
I had to save you first.

249
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,090
What about Jiangyong?

250
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,070
I had no choice.

251
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,790
There was nothing I could do.

252
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,880
Stop thinking about it.

253
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,940
Jiangyong is gone,

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,950
but we have to live our lives.

255
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,450
We can't go on like this.

256
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,420
What was his last word?

257
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,490
He said...

258
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,440
He hoped all of you could be well,

259
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,770
no more fighting.

260
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,350
What else?

261
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,990
He said...

262
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,920
He wanted to go home.

263
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,480
Go home.

264
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,310
Go home...

265
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,460
Tianye.

266
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,160
Why didn't you take him home?

267
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,920
Tianye.

268
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,300
Don't be like this.

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Calm down.

270
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,390
Don't cry.

271
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,730
Why do I have to carry stones?

272
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,340
They represent your mistakes, Tianye.

273
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,310
One must learn from childhood

274
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,110
that mistakes come with a price.

275
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,830
Carry the stones up the mountain
and throw them away,

276
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,030
and then you can correct your mistakes.

277
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,670
You must not only carry them on your back

278
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,670
but also keep them in your heart.

279
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,300
You must carry extremely heavy stones,

280
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,960
perhaps for the rest of your life,

281
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,360
and it still won't be enough
for atonement.

282
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,070
Admit your mistakes

283
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,350
and accept your punishment.

284
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,030
Only when you really
realize your mistakes and correct them

285
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,300
can you put down the stones you carry.

Why are you back at work already?

323
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,720
How's everything going
with your family situation?

324
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,520
It's fine now.

325
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,680
Really?

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,160
You told me at the hospital

327
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,280
that you wanted to floor it.

328
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm a bit worried.

329
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,010
What's your plan exactly?

330
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,740
Just take them down.

331
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,940
I asked Mai to find them.

332
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,050
Neither Song Hao

333
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,990
nor Luo Bo

334
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,370
can get away.

335
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,390
As long as we don't break the rules,
it's your call.

336
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,000
Stop digging in my pockets.

337
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,720
Let's eat.

338
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,000
It's already become a habit.

339
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,340
Your investigation is finally over.

340
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,930
Any news?

341
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,310
Mr. Ma.

342
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,180
I've been stuck at home every day.

343
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,510
How could I get any news?

344
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,590
It seems that my uncle

345
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,240
is still investigating it.

346
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,640
Your uncle can't help you.

347
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,790
What should you do?

348
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,880
That's right.

349
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,790
Mr. Ma,

350
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,200
what should I do?

351
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,850
Don't be afraid.

352
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
If your uncle doesn't want to help you,
I will.

353
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,360
If you need anything,

354
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,400
just tell me.

355
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,750
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

356
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,120
But...

357
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,050
I also need your help.

358
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,120
Mr. Ma,

359
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,850
what can I do for you?

360
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,510
Just tell me.

361
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,750
I want you to visit Mr. Wang.

362
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,790
Talk to

363
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,110
his daughter

364
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,240
and see if she has
any news about Song Hao.

365
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,000
Mr. Ma,

366
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,110
you know,

367
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,510
given the relationship
between my uncle and Mr. Wang,

368
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,130
I don't think he wants to see me.

369
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,790
You're smart.

370
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,390
You'll find a way, won't you?

371
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,070
Mr. Ma!

372
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,790
Okay.

373
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,250
I'll figure something out.

374
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,820
Leave it to me.

375
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,750
Okay.

376
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,790
[Public Security]

377
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,640
Did you bring all the documents?

378
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,110
Yes.

379
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,680
Okay.

380
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,890
D-Director Ye.

381
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,650
Director Ye.

382
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,910
Why is he back already?

383
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,170
Director Ye.

384
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,470
-Come in.
-Director Ye.

385
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,240
Have a seat, Qin Feng.

386
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,720
Okay.

387
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,900
I've been away for a while,

388
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,600
and my orchids are wilting.

389
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,940
It seems

390
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,030
you got back to work today

391
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,630
because you knew I'd return.

392
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,170
I do have to come back

393
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,330
and report to you about my recent work.

394
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,190
Go ahead.

395
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,270
We discovered

396
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,610
that Ye Siyuan

397
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,070
has contacted Wang Yiyi, Song Hao's wife,

398
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,410
very frequently.

399
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,410
He must be trying to get some money

400
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,030
while Song Hao is in trouble.

401
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,750
Just investigate as we normally would.

402
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,390
Don't worry about my nephew.

403
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,930
Got it.

404
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,960
Actually, Wang Yiyi

405
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,640
doesn't have any direct connection

406
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,240
with Jinding Group.

407
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,110
Song Hao was in charge of

408
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,810
financial operations

409
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
within the group.

410
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,400
If we

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,850
investigate their money directly

412
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,790
and freeze the funds for investigation,

413
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,400
we'll be able to find out

414
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,830
who owns the money.

415
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,640
Okay.

416
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,550
Loser from Longwan, what are you doing?

417
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,200
Stop!

418
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,640
Boss, they broke in!

419
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,370
What do you think you're doing?

420
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,240
Mr. Liu,

421
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
what a rare guest.

422
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,070
What brings you guys here?

423
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,560
Take me to see your brother.

424
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,340
Earlier,

425
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,140
I heard that someone smashed your head,

426
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
and I didn't believe it.

427
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,170
Turns out it's true!

428
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,400
What are you saying?

429
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,160
Watch your language!

430
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,020
Don't touch me!

431
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,060
Go away!

432
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,130
Don't touch me!

433
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,880
Tianfei.

434
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,480
Look at the state you're in.

435
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,340
Why are you still acting so tough?

436
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,720
You people from Longwan

437
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,830
are all seriously injured yet so stubborn.

438
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,030
How dare you come here

439
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,960
and try to ask my brother for money?

440
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,750
Fine.

441
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,220
You want money, right?

442
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,030
Okay.

443
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,310
Take it!

444
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,000
-Is it enough?
-Go away!

445
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,550
Is it enough?

446
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,590
Tianye!

447
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,880
Take me to your brother.

448
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,100
Liu Tianye,

449
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,940
you have nothing now.

450
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,680
You have to beg me.

451
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,600
Understand?

452
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,110
You have no money,

453
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,050
and you'll lose your land soon.

454
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,330
Jiangyong is also dead.

455
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,490
If you'd just focused on

456
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,240
selling chickens
instead of dreaming of fortunes,

457
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,230
none of this would've happened.

458
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,860
How dare you ask me for money?

459
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,030
Come on!

460
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,640
Step back!

461
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,550
Kill me!

462
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,070
Do you know whose turf this is?

463
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,200
I don't care!

464
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,310
Tell your brother to come out!

465
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,270
Step back!

466
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,530
Come on!

467
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,000
Calm down.

468
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,480
Tell him to come.

469
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,070
Tianye.

470
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,730
I just finished a piece of calligraphy.

471
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,040
Come and take a look.

472
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,750
Hurry!

473
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,160
Calm down.

474
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,920
Tianye.

475
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,160
Mind creates reality.

476
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,740
How do you feel about

477
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,370
these words?

478
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,970
I'm here to discuss something important.

479
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,360
It seems my calligraphy

480
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,270
is not profound enough.

481
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,720
What do you want

482
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,960
to discuss?

483
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
Didn't you ask me

484
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,330
if we could make a deal?

485
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,110
Yes,

486
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,200
we can.

487
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,720
I'll give you what you want.

488
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,620
I don't even know what I want.

489
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,270
Ma Jin.

490
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,730
You know, all these years,

491
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,720
I've devoted myself to calligraphy

492
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,180
just because I don't want
to get involved...

493
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,730
I don't want to get involved
in these worldly affairs,

494
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,310
let alone all the fighting and killing.

495
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,680
I know you've always wanted
to replace Ma Jin,

496
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,640
and you also want the casino business.

497
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,350
You dare not touch him

498
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,610
because you know someone is backing him.

499
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
But I dare.

500
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,210
Longwan has nothing left now.

501
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,480
I want him to give back

502
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
everything he took from us.

503
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,160
I can also expose

504
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,740
the person behind him.

505
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,630
Easier said than done.

506
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,440
I know

507
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,920
you are a person of loyalty and principle.

508
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,200
But besides that,

509
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,100
what else do you have?

510
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:10,830
My life.

511
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,270
I've been gambling with my life
from the beginning.

512
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,680
Now that I'm still alive,

513
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,250
it means I'm still qualified for the game.

514
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,960
It's not a bad deal for you, right?

515
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,530
In this world,

516
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,350
some people want profit,

517
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,570
some want victory.

518
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,500
But I, He Muzhi,

519
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,560
only care if one can be loyal

520
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,570
and keep their promise.

521
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,310
You're standing before me alive.

522
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,240
Well done.

523
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,850
Then I'll

524
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,280
place the bet

525
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,680
with you.

526
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,660
H-How can we move this?

527
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,120
A noble person loves wealth
but acquires it through righteous means.

528
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,050
I didn't take a penny of your money.

529
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,989
It's all here.

530
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,150
Okay.

531
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,130
Then we'll use the money

532
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,800
to make a deal

533
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,000
with you.

534
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,940
Go ahead.

535
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,400
We want to buy

536
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,530
shares of your company.

537
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,760
What do you think?

538
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,730
Deal.

539
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
My money is in your husband's hands.

540
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,630
Ye Siyuan is a liar.

541
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,140
He can't help Song Hao.

542
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,590
Also,

543
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,360
you've caught the attention
of the police as well.

544
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,280
Now,

545
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,540
only I can help you.

546
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,040
Can you save him?

547
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,160
Tell Song Hao to contact me.

548
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,840
Everyone is looking for him.

549
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,100
Why should I trust you?

550
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,270
You have no choice.

551
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,360
Song Hao.

552
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,960
You're finally willing
to talk with your old friend.

553
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,360
Sir,

554
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,110
how do you plan to help me?

555
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,790
You're standing
in the eye of the storm.

556
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,670
Ma Jin is looking for you everywhere,

557
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,930
and Luo Bo has escaped.

558
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,650
Now,

559
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,560
anyone close to you
will be struck by thunder.

560
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,950
There's no way you can come back.

561
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,440
Sir,

562
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,770
what's that supposed to mean?

563
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,320
I don't understand.

564
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,240
If Ma Jin doesn't back down,

565
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
this ship

566
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,420
will sink sooner or later.

567
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,110
And when that happens,

568
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,850
everyone will be on their own.

569
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,110
I won't help Ma Jin,

570
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,360
and I don't care where you are.

571
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,990
Right now,

572
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,130
I just want my money.

573
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Okay.

574
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,690
I can keep quiet.

575
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,150
But you need to get three passports

576
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,170
for my family

577
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,820
and send us abroad.

578
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,000
Otherwise, you'll never see that money.

579
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,660
No problem.

580
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,510
Money

581
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,700
for passports.

582
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:20,590
Okay.

583
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,030
I'll decide on

584
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,510
the time and place.

585
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay.

586
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,380
Zhong.

587
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,510
Ji.

588
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,370
Can you attend the legal studies seminar

589
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,000
this weekend?

590
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,670
I can't.

591
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,230
I'll be working overtime.

592
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,480
I have a pile of cases to solve.

593
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,650
I was hoping you could brief me on it.

594
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,230
Captain Ji.

595
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,570
Director Peng.

596
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,190
Why haven't I seen

597
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,590
ECID's analysis report?

598
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,510
I almost forgot.

599
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,880
I'll have someone prepare it right away.

600
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,190
It won't hold things up.

601
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,800
By the way,

602
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
about the model unit selection,

603
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,400
you need to keep working on it.

604
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Yes, Director Yan.

605
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,920
No problem.

606
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,840
We're working on it.

607
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,640
Working on it.

608
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,530
Don't worry.

609
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,320
[Certificate of Honor]

610
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,490
Mr. Ma.

611
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,990
Tomorrow at 2 p.m.,

612
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,970
Song Hao will go to

613
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,130
the East Passenger Transport Center.

614
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,890
I'll stall for time.

615
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,180
Director Ye.

616
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,320
Let's

617
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,330
summarize the current progress.

618
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,980
Director Ye,

619
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:23,860
we've confirmed that the gaming company

620
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,190
[Ye Tianyou,
Before the Discipline Inspection]

621
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,590
is used for money laundering.

622
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,450
Okay.

623
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,990
Keep digging.

624
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,680
Got it.

625
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,120
If

626
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,500
we want to continue
with the investigation,

627
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,830
there's something I need to report to you.

628
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,790
Ye Siyuan has been close to Luo Bo lately,

629
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,370
and they're making plans.

630
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,240
I think they're targeting you.

631
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,520
Go to a place

632
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,300
with me tonight.

633
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,550
Qin Feng,

634
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,650
I've heard a lot about you.

635
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,080
Let me introduce him.

636
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
This is Zeng Xu, another apprentice

637
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,550
of mine.
