Come with me!

Sir, she can barely stand.

I only meant to drink with this girl.

Yet this guy kept pushing me off.

202
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,270
I demand an explanation!

203
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,510
Mr. Liu, don't be mad.

204
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,550
Go back to the room and drink.

You deal with it then!

Okay!

You picked it up for me when we first met.

I've always liked bunnies

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,670
since I was a kid.

234
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,790
I longed to keep one as a pet
in childhood,

235
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,670
but my family wouldn't allow it.

236
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,510
I saved up for a long time
to buy this phone charm.

named Qiao Defu.

270
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,900
You must be thinking

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,120
that I'm putting my life at stake again

272
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,250
just for some money.

273
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,640
But that's not true.

274
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,970
I'm not in need of money now.

275
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,520
The thing is,
I've found myself a powerful patron.

276
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,990
With a good patron comes good benefits.

277
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,810
If I am to achieve benefits,

278
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,010
I have to do my patron's bidding, right?

279
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,750
Be honest with me.

Who's really behind you?

281
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,130

holds tremendous power.

and always got his way.

285
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,150
You think
that was because of his abilities?

286
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,040
No.

287
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,630
His success was attributed
to this big shot behind me.

Hanzhang,

289
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,650

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,150
Would you like to climb even higher up

291
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,210
the career ladder?

292

You don't want to move forward?

293
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,260
But I do.

294
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,890
I believe
I can still rise to a higher position.

295
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,720

Peng Hanzhang, in your eyes,

297
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,670
I'm just a doofus.

298

But now,

299
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,260
I'm done being a doofus.

I am He Muzhi.

301
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,910
Through my own efforts,

302
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,960
I will have everyone in Hanzhou

303
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,390
who sees me respectfully call me

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,100
"Mr. He."

305
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,670
Mr. He,

306
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,320
what exactly do you want me to do for you?

307
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,920
It's actually a simple task.

308
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,910
That officer named Qin Feng in your bureau
is a real pain in the neck.

309
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,440
He has always been after me.

310
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,870
It's getting on my nerves.

311
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,850
My boss is also very upset about it.

312
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,610
Just get him out of the way.

313
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,850
It's a small favor.

314
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,370
You'll do it for me, right?

315
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,080
After it's done,

316
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,110
I'll gain a foothold,

317
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,490
and you'll get a promotion.

318
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600

325
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
Absolutely.

326

I happen to have arranged a party.

327
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,270
You should attend it.

328
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,720
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

329
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,030
What's inappropriate about it?

330
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,270
Just friends hanging out.

331
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,080
Do you play cards?

332
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,000
A little.

Let me you take to a great place,

335
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,050
What a big yacht.

336
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,100
Mr. Qiao, do you

337
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,130
often come here?

338
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,630
Not really.

339
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,270
Mr. He owns this place.

340
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,970

It's Uncle Tianye?

344
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,370
Mr. Qiao.

345
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
Allow me to introduce...

What a surprise to see you here today.

348
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,910
You already know each other?

349

Yes, we do.

350
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,570
We interacted a lot back in the day.

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,880

bigger and bigger now,

352
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,610
he never hangs with me anymore.

353
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,830
Then we must have a good game tonight.

354
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,400
Sure!

355
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,880

Tianye, come on in.

357
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,740
This way, Mr. Qiao.

358
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,480
What on earth is going on

359
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
between Longwan Logistics and Qiao Defu?

360
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
First it was the Grand Paradise,

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,010
and now this.

362
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,380

what's your opinion?

365
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,310
I think now is too soon
to jump to conclusions.

366
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,350
What's happening on the yacht
is not clear yet.

367
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,410
What if it's just a business meeting?

368
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,720
Yeah.

369
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,240
We came here today
just to gather information.

370
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,540

Let's figure things out first.

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,020
It's your turn.

373
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,510
Make a move.

374
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,090
I'll pass.

375
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,210
Let's wait for Mr. Qiao's choice.

376
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,180
Aren't you...

377
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,750
laying an ambush?

378
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,660
Well, I've got a low hand.

379
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,550
I'd rather not take risks,
considering the high stakes.

380
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,410
Don't you love taking risks best?

381
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,300
Mr. Qiao,

382
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,410
let me tell you.

383
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,080
Tianye is the top smuggler in Hanzhou.

384
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,880
He makes money by risking his life.

385
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,110
But every penny I present

386
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,570
is guaranteed to be clean.

387
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,290
Listen,

388
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm not interested in your past.

389
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
As long as the pay's good,

390
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,110
anyone can be my partner.

391
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,110
That's right, Mr. Qiao.

392
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,970
Why not consider working with us?

393
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,680
We also rank top in Hanzhou

394
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
in terms of strength.

395
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,160
Plus,

396
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,830
the risk is lower.

397
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,740
Sorry.

398
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,460
Mr. He,
I've agreed to partner with Mr. Liu.

399
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,760
There are always

400
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,750
cooperation opportunities in business.

401
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,640
We'll work together

402
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,270
next time, okay?

403
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,110
Sure, okay.

404
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,150
Mr. He,

405
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
calculate how much I owe you.

406
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,830
I'd like to settle the account today.

407
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,960
What's that for?

408
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,110
It's not much money.

409
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,070
Let's just play.

410
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,160
Fun is all that matters.

411
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,090
Show your cards.

412
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,480
No need.

413
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,200
I'll pass.

414
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,000
Mr. Qiao is right.

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,860
Anyone can be a business partner.

416
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,740
I'll follow Mr. Qiao's example and pass.

417
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,700
What about you, Muzhi?

418
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,290
Impressive, Mr. He.

419
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,680
Going all in without looking at the cards.

420
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,190
Don't you fear my ambush?

421
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,720
I guess you have a terrible hand.

422
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I've gone all in. Do you dare to call?

423
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,240
What if you have a worse hand than mine?

424
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,210
Why wouldn't I dare to call?

425
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,540
This is getting interesting.

426
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,410
Tension's building up.

427
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,080
I'm out of luck today.

428
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,400
Had better head out.

429
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,720
If Mr. Qiao is quitting, I'm quitting too.

430
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,570
I need some fresh air.

431
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,030
Mr. Qiao, I'll go with you!

432
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,100
I have three Aces.

433
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,280
How are you going to beat me?

434
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,720
Well,

435
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,440
I always make the best of a bad hand.

436
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,140
What if I get a straight flush?

437
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,410
A pause, please.

438
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,820
These petty stakes are boring me.

439
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,750
What kind of wager would you like?

440
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,010
Don't you enjoy gambling with your life?

441
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,440
Bring it on then.

442
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
Perhaps

443
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,480
heaven is on my side.

444
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,940
Turn the card over.

445
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,610
Liu Tianye.

446
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,950
Chances are that heaven's on your side,

447
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,880
but whether you get to see
this card tonight...

448
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,200
is up to me.

449
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,550
He Biao...

450
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,680
has basically laid his cards on the table
with Qiao Defu.

451
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,940
Maybe he'll even get one step ahead of us.

452
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,720
He's not much of a...

453
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,510
prominent businessman.

454
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,720
Things won't get that serious, right?

455
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,310
Besides,

456
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,110
Qiao Defu seems to have
powerful connections.

457
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,350
Could He Biao have him

458
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,400
under his thumb
after just a few card games?

459
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
Qiao Defu is insatiable.

460
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,590
All that money we've invested

461
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,000
might go down the drain.

462
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,480
Tianye.

463
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,950
He Biao is a strong rival.

464
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,190
He's capable of anything.

465
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,890
If necessary, we'll fight him.

466
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,580
Should he ruin our plans,
we'll ruin his as well.

467
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,920
It's between them and us

468
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,880
for the chance to make a quantum leap.

469
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,750
Keep close watch on everything.

470
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,400
We're close to success. Don't blow it.

471
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,730
What are you going to do?

472
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,320
I'd like to invite Su to dinner.

473
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,770
Okay. I'll arrange it.

474
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,370
Feng, you're here?

475
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,830
I see everyone's around.

476
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,350
Feng.

477
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,270
Have you eaten yet?

478
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,930
Yes.

479
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,600
Have you?

480
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,030
Yes.

481
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,890
Here you are.

482
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,000
I already have a cup.

483
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,260
What are you two doing?

484
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,910
How's your company

485
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,060
doing?

486
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,340
All good.

487
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Let me know if you have any problems.

488
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,340
Seriously?

489
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,250
Can you fix problems for us?

490
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,920
Of course.

491
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,350
Nowadays only family can help you.

492
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,310
Are outsiders even reliable?

493
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,510
Well, I know that.

494
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,400
What I mean is,

495
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
we'd hate to cause you trouble,

496
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,040
given the nature of your job.

497
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,830
T-There's a question

498
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,070
I have to ask you, Tianye.

499
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,790
Ask away.

500
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,470
Are you a gambler now?

501
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,830
No.

502
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,160
No?

503
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,500
Where did you go today?

504
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,920
I attended a business meeting

505
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,850
on a yacht today.

506
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,060
Why do you ask?

507
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,350
Have you been stalking me?

508
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,380
Stalking you?

509
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,720
I'm just asking.

510
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,790
Why would I stalk you?

511
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,640
So you were on a yacht?

512
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,690
Yes. And?

513
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,070
Was there a gambling table?

514
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,580
No.

515
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,200
That's good.

516
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,160
Tianye, take my advice—

517
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,830
I might as well say it to all of you.

518
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,510
Longwan Logistics
is getting off the ground.

519
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,350
Your lives are becoming better off.

520
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,960
You must stay away from gambling.

521
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,820
No fortune can survive
a gambling addiction.

522
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,420
You got it?

523
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,310
I already told you I didn't gamble.

524
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,400
Qiao Defu took me there
for a business meeting.

525
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
I was also surprised.

526
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,480
I already attended the meeting.
What's there to do about it?

527
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,340
I couldn't have just quit, right?

528
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,270
If they invite you to a yacht again
where there's a gambling table,

529
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,330
just give me a call.

530
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,170
I'll show you how fast we can respond.

531
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
I don't hope to arrest you guys
on a mission

532
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
to crack down illegal dens one day.

533
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Arrest whom?

534
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
Do you have to act like a cop
all the time?

535
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,720
You're at home, not in the police station.

536
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
You treat us like this every day...

537
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,930
Alright.

538
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,920
You're not a gambler.

539
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,480
That's perfect.

540
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,110
I'm just reminding you to avoid

541
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,920
being taken advantage of.

542
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,350
No...

543
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,780
By the way, Tianye,

544
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,350
didn't I tell you to stay away

545
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,950
from He Gang and his fellows?

546
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,590
They run illegal businesses.

547
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,950
I'm a businessman, okay?

548
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,000
I had no choice.

549
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,310
Qiao Defu took me to meet He Biao.

550
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,680
I didn't initiate a meeting with him.

551
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,550
Do you have to do business
with these people?

552
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,410
I have to making a living, don't I?

553
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
By earning dirty money?

554
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,640
Can't you shift your focus of business?

555
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,770
Look, with the current team we have...

556
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,920
Let me put it this way.

557
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
They're engaged in shady business, right?

558
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,310
If you hang out with them

559
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,830
and they get caught one day

560
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,830
with you being at the scene,

561
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,510
won't you be taken by the police
for questioning too?

562
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:24,960
How will you explain yourself?

563
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,750
I'm clean. I'll have
a legit explanation for everything.

564
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,200
Alright?

565
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,510
You'll be detained anyway!

566
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:28,750
Look,

567
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,720
it'll be all fine as long as I'm clean,
right?

568
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,920
You just can't do business without them.
Is that so?

569
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,790
Is this an assault, officer?

570
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,240
What?

571
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,160
-You're a cop. Did you just assault me?
-What's going on?

572
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,430
Are you actually fighting?

573
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,440
No.

574
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,510
He accused me of assaulting him.
How's that possible?

575
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,030
Alright. Dismissed, everyone.

576
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,440
The baby is getting sleepy.

577
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,140
Tianye, hold him.

578
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,510
Baoying!

579
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,440
Look at me.

580
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,370
Don't touch him.

581
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,080
You just hit me again!

582
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,930
Tianfei!

583
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,200
You left your lighter there again.

584
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,210
Oh, I forgot it.

585
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,590
Tell me.

586
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,360
What happened just now?

587
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,590
Why did you quarrel

588
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,510
with Feng?

589
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,830
It wasn't a quarrel.

590
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,070
It really wasn't.

591
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,110
Aren't we now doing business

592
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,200
with Qiao Defu?

593
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,000
He's likely acquainted with bad people.

594
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
Feng worried that I might get scammed,

595
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,170
so he gave me a little reminder.

596
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,790
Wasn't he just looking out for you?

597
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,520
I knew he was.

598
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,720
So I didn't quarrel with him.

599
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,380
There are certain motions to go through
in doing business.

600
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,790
But Feng sees things in black and white.

601
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,350
How am I supposed to do business that way?

602
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,110
Listen, son.

603
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,790
Those motions in business aside,

604
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,510
you need to be clear

605
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,160
who truly cares about you

606
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,200
and who's secretly plotting against you.

607
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,310
You must figure that out, right?

608
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,680
Right. You've been telling me that

609
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,070
since childhood. I understand.

610
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,160
Okay. Then why did you

611
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,350
-get in a fight with Feng over this?
-I didn't. He raised his voice.

612
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,740
He was being all stubborn.

613
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,400
Mom,

614
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,030
how come you're getting

615
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,760
more and more grey hair lately?

616
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,130
How about I take you out to get it dyed?

617
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,090
I'm getting old.

618
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,790
Of course
more and more of my hair is going grey.

619
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,500
I won't dye it.
The grey can't be concealed anyway.

620
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,960
Just have your hair dyed. How about red?

621
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,690
It's trendy.
Your skin will look fairer that way.

622
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,680
Or purple.

623
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,350
They both represent prosperity.

624
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,240
Purple is no good.

625
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,310
That's a bit over the top.

626
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,440
-Won't I look terrible with purple hair?
-Red hair looks great.

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
Don't give in to aging, okay?

628
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,040
Longwan Logistics needs your leadership.

629
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,720
Mom, the sweet soup is ready.
Fancy a bowl of it?

630
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,580
Let me serve it.

631
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,720
I mean it, Mom.

632
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,550
Trust me and give it a try.

633
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,680
Dye your hair dark red.

634
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
It isn't noticeable indoors.

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
Only in sunlight
does it show a subtle red tint.

636
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,300
It's very stylish.

637
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,550
I'll pass.

638
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,920
See, there's no way
to conceal my grey hair.

639
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,510
Fine. Then let's buy a wig.

640
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,610
Wigs nowadays are made very well.

641
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,920
They're indistinguishable from real hair.

642
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,720
You can have a new hairstyle every day.

643
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,930
That means a different mood every day.

644
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,290
Fine. I'll listen to you.

645
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,950
Let's go try on wigs sometime.

646
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,510
Sure.

647
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
I'll make an appointment for you.

648
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,720
Okay.

649
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,000
What happened
between you and Tianye earlier?

650
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,590
What were you fighting about?

651
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,300
We weren't fighting.
We were just fooling around.

652
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,160
I saw everything.

653
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,220
Why hide it from me?

654
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,470
What am I hiding from you?

655
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,030
Has Tianye been close

656
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,320
with Qiao Defu lately?

657
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,810
Yes, as they're business partners now.

658
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,440
You two fought over that?

659
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,570
No, I'm just asking.

660
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,750
Distance yourselves from that rough crowd.

661
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,640
Take small steps in doing business.

662
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,510
Don't try to bite off
more than you can chew.

663
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,910
It could lead to trouble.

664
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,750
Tianye literally gave his all

665
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,160
to close this deal.

666
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,960
He racked his brains to become

667
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,090
Mr. Qiao's partner.

668
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,270
He even took loans from many people.

669
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,330
It was really hard.

670
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,460
Can't Tianye choose someone else?

671
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,500
Why must it be Qiao Defu?

672
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,240
So far, Mr. Qiao is our only option.

673
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,110
If this project proves to be a success,

674
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,970
Longwan Logistics will expand
beyond its borders.

675
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,510
Don't aim too high.

676
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,880
Take it slow.

677
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,290
Keep an eye on everything.

678
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,520
Don't worry.

679
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,530
I'll take good care of the family.

680
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,230
Just focus on your job

681
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,610
and care for yourself.

682
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,130
I'm not worried about you.

683
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,750
I'm worried about Tianye,

684
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,550
as he might

685
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,810
make hasty decisions.

686
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,270
All will be too late if that happens.

687
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,370
Don't worry.

688
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,450
I'll watch him.

689
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,190
Has Tianye gone to bed?

690
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,820
You wash the bowls.

691
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,460
Are you done eating?

692
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,190
Yes.

693
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,710
What would you like to eat?

694
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,430
Anything is fine.

695
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,070
Okay.

696
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,190
How come that guy looks so familiar?

697
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,190
He's that delivery guy from Longwan.

698
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,090
Hey, you.

699
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,070
What are you looking at?
Don't you know who I am?

700
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,400
Is everyone in Longwan
as proud as you are?

701
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,050
You know what?

702
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,950
Even Liu Tianye has to

703
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,760
respect me like I'm his father.

704
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,390
Look at me!

705
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,510
Smile and call me Mr. He!

706
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,380
-Call me Mr. He!
-Gang!

707
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,640
-Call me Mr. He!
-Gang!

708
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,850
Gang,

709
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,440
what a coincidence.

710
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,290
What's going on?

711
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,680
Who are you to chime in?

712
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,950
Are you into this pretty boy?

713
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Xiaomei,

714
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,840
you're an employee of the Grand Paradise.

715
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,960
Standing up for a lowly delivery guy...

716
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
Isn't it beneath you?

717
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,070
Gang,

718
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,570
do me a favor

719
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,670
and spare this delivery guy.

720
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,000
Fine.

721
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,640
I'll do you a favor then.

722
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,210
Give it to me.

723
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,030
Buddy,

724
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,160
if you drink up

725
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,530
this bottle of liquor

726
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,540
in front of your woman,

727
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,170
I'll let you go.

728
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,680
Okay?

729
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,400
Gang,

730
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,260
let me drink it.

731
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,460
It's just the same.

732
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,480
You wretch!

733
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
Did I ask you to drink it?

734
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,870
Fine!

735
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,360
Down it!

736
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,180
You love to drink, huh?

737
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,710
Now you have a chance!

738
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,000
Run!

739
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,240
Are you okay?

740
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,300
Are you okay, Gang?

741
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,750
Sorry.

742
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,330
I got you in trouble.

743
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,580
No worries.

744
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,190
I was thinking about resigning anyway.

745
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,730
Can I ask you something?

746
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,800
Go ahead.

747
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,140
Never mind.

748
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,240
Did you want to ask

749
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,350
why I got into this line of business?

750
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,410
It's not a forbidden question.

751
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,060
Although this doesn't

752
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,530
sound like a decent job,

753
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,270
I absolutely won't do

754
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,400
anything beyond my moral boundaries.

755
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,030
If you're in urgent need of money,

756
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,500
I have some to spare.

757
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm not,

758
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,370
but my family is—
as if there's a bottomless pit to fill.

759
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,480
I understand.

760
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,600
I'm not rich

761
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,000
or powerful now.

762
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,490
But I swear to you,

763
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,030
as long as I'm alive

764
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,550
and breathing,

765
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,260
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

766
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,960
Tianye.

767
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,550
Come eat.

768
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,650
Have Mom and Ziyi finished eating?

769
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,300
They're with Baoying now.

770
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,370
Did Crazy just leave?

771
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,480
Have you two made up yet?

772
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,190
Nothing serious happened.

773
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,920
You all are just overreacting.

774
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,710
Do you know Zhang Xin,
an alumnus of yours?

775
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,480
Zhang Xin?

776
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,960
You mean the one working for Xinrui Group?

777
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,980
I know her, kind of.

778
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,250
She was quite famous back in college.

779
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,530
I ran into her a few days ago.

780
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,780
She asked about

781
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,490
our cooperation with Chengjian Group

782
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,810
and congratulated us.

783
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,880
I was wondering

784
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,440
how she got to know that

785
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,960
before we announced it.

786
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,640
What else did she say to you?

787
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,000
Well...

788
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,220
Nothing much.

789
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,840
She invited me to her horse ranch.

790
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,510
You should go.

791
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,850
Won't that be nice?

792
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,190
I don't know how to ride horses.

793
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm just not interested.

794
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:35,840
You see,

795
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,630
Xinrui is a leading enterprise in Hanzhou.

796
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,880
She's your alumnus.
Why not use it to bond with her?

797
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,110
Longwan Logistics is developing.

798
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,370
What if there's a chance to collaborate?

799
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,370
It makes sense.

800
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,360
I'll do it.

801
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,130
That's the spirit.

802
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,320
I'll contact her later for a visit.

803
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,230
Make it quick.

804
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,480
You're doing great.

805
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,680
To the left. Perfect.

806
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,480
Good job.

807
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
Impressive.

808
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,880
Excellent.

809
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,100
I was a bit scared

810
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
when I first started riding a horse.

811
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,900
Don't be nervous.

812
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,280
Horses can sense it.

813
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
The more relaxed you are,

814
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,610
the more they trust you.

815
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,590
I remember all the tips on the ground,

816
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,990
but they slip my mind
when I'm on horseback.

817
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,960
You'll get better with practice.

818
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,920
Come here more often.

819
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,780
I'll teach you.

820
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,960
Longwan Logistics

821
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,310
will be a famous enterprise in Hanzhou.

822
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,670
Our company is just getting started.

823
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,230
We lag far behind Xinrui.

824
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,290
Aren't enterprises all built up
step by step?

825
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,510
That's true.

826
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,110
Though Longwan Logistics
is in its early stages,

827
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,820
we do have

828
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,620
our own advantages.

829
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,190
Whatever our focus is,

830
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,880
be it farming in the past
or logistics at present,

831
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,670
we've always prioritized integrity
in doing business.

832
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,430
I believe

833
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,040
Longwan Logistics
will be better and better.

834
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,390
I look forward

835
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,250
to hearing your advice, Xin.

836
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,710
There's a lot I need to learn from you.

837
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,770
Longwan Logistics

838
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
welcomes any support you may offer.

839
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,630
It hasn't been easy
for it to get where it is today.

840
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,360
Every opportunity will be cherished.

841
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,880
With you at Longwan Logistics,

842
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,340
it'll rise to prominence.

843
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,110
Then I'll often come ride horses with you.

844
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,570
I hope it won't bother you.

845
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,150
You're welcome anytime.

846
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,670
It's still early.

847
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,440
Let's go for another ride.

848
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
-Let’s go.
-Sure.

849
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,970
[Bao Fu Pawn Shop]

850
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,560
Well...

851
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,710
That's quite a large amount.

852
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,230
I know about him.

853
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,880
He's famous.

854
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,810
Who wouldn't have heard about him?

855
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,650
Alright, I got it. Don't worry.

856
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Give me the car keys. I need to go out.

857
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,240
Give me the car keys.
I'm heading out for an issue.

858
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,740
Did He Biao give you a task?

859
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,330
Don't be so nosy.

860
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,960
Car keys.

861
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,310
Just take me with you.

862
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,480
You shouldn't be involved in this.

863
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,930
I can handle it myself.

864
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,060
Well, then,

865
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,900
tell me

866
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,330
who's He Biao's patron,

867
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,330
and I'll be gone.

868
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,190
Mai,

869
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,590
can you stop thinking about that thing

870
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,360
all day long?

871
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
I'll give you money if you want it.

872
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,370
All I need is a figure.

873
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,400
Just don't ask me about that thing again,
okay?

874
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,880
You think that'll make me quit?

875
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,210
I won't unless I'm dead.

876
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,230
Don't say that word, you stubborn guy.

877
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,070
Stop asking about it,

878
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,000
or this matter will cost you
your life one day.

879
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,760
Understood?

880
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,230
I'm not dead yet, am I?

881
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,280
I must keep probing as long as I'm alive.

882
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,030
Right?

883
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,850
I'll go with you.

884
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm older than you, aren't I?

885
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,960
Will you listen to me just this once?

886
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,090
Go back and have tea.

887
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,900
I'll drive for you.

888
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,320
If you have a death wish,
don't die near me.

889
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,770
Do it somewhere else.

890
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,240
Mai, stop following me,
or our friendship's over.

891
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,000
Get lost!

892
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,080
Mai.

893
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,150
Crazy,

894
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,190
Su Hongbao is likely to make a move soon.

895
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,070
Okay. Got it.

896
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,000
We'll track him.

897
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,670
Okay.
