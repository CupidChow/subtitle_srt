Listen, take it easy

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,590
Nonsense. I'm perfectly fine.

that Liu Yi

So far,

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,590
there are still some suspicious points.

According to the news
from the accident site,

68
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,630

What kind of mess is this?

94
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,500
He has

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
a vice general manager named Fang Lei,

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
who's solely in charge of engineering

97

and has no direct connection with us.

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,220
he can't get involved in this,

115
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,170
so he wants me to be fully in charge.

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,490
All the injured are in my hospital now.

117
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Director Peng,
please hold off on that report

118
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,770
and buy me some time

119
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,520
so I can talk to their families.

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,610
I'll try my best.

121
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,680
But listen,

122
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,430
I have my limits.

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,310
As for Fang Lei,
I'll have someone look for him.

124
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,000
Once we find him,

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
we'll send him to you.

126
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,870
Don't worry, Director Peng.

127
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,070
Whatever trouble Zhang Xin caused,

128
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,920
I will fix it.

129
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,600
You might fix it for now,

130
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,560
but can you save the day every time?

131
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,750
She acts recklessly,

132
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,620
and I'm the one in trouble.

133
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,150
Why would our boss use

134
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,800
someone like her?

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,140
We're not the boss,

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,830
so we can't possibly know why.

137
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Perhaps Zhang Xin

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,490

the college entrance exam soon?

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,170
Have you decided on which university?

141
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,050
I've been too busy

142

to think about it.

143
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,170
Don't put too much pressure on him.

144
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,920
If domestic universities don't work out,
you can send him abroad.

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,140

You can access it anytime.

What?

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,240
This is one trap after another.

150
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,630
However,

151
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,530
you really know

how to utilize
others people's weaknesses.

153
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,570
Listen,

154
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,409
you must keep an eye on

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,490
Zhang Xin.

156
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,520
She'll cause big trouble sooner or later.

157
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,870
Got it.

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,630
I've been keeping an eye on

are all related to him.

161
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,680
They are all contracted by him

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
and built

by Xinrui Group.

164
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,830
Do you think no one's backing him up?

165
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,560
No way.

166
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,450
Xinrui Group was also mentioned
in this meeting.

167
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,570
But our leaders had differing opinions.

168
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,820
Do you suspect

169
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,090
that Xinrui Group silenced him?

170
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,850
Well,

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,000
on the night Liu Yi died,

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
someone called Fang Lei

173
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,670
went to see him.

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I've sent someone to find this person.

175
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,930
He might have witnessed the entire crime.

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,020
Take a look.

191
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,950
You've had a hard time
in there these years.

192
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,470
Do you like it?

193
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,550
I do.

194
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,670
The cufflinks look great.

195
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,330
I can even use them as weapons.

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
Stop joking.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,720
Alright.

198
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,010
After all, now that I'm a manager,

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,670
I won't do anything dangerous again.

200
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,360
Good then.

201
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,650
I was just teasing you.

202
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,670
Sir.

203
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,670
Sir.

204
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,030
How's it going?

205
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,600
Sir,

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,550
don't worry.
We're keeping a close eye on it.

207
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,810
Nothing will go wrong.

208
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,900
It's just that they work

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,510
for over ten hours straight each day,

210
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,450
and they can't keep this up.

211
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,840
Look,

212
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,000
get some money from my car,

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
distribute it to the guys,

214
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,080
and spread them out
across several locations.

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,730
Thank you, sir!

216
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,630
Thank you, sir!

217
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,390
Go ahead.

218
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,050
Uncle Tianye.

219
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
Bring Tianfei over here.

220
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,750
Got it.

221
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,160
Thank you, everyone.

222
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Thank you for coming.

223
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,030
Sir!

224
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,230
Where's Uncle Tianfei?

225
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,760
He got drunk and passed out.

226
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,840
Sir,

227
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,480
a few days ago, that Feng from Longwan

228
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,630
arrested several of my guys again.

229
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,630
Who did he arrest?

230
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,590
Some young boys who've been following me
for a few days.

231
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,440
Is it serious?

232
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,380
It's an assault case,

233
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,280
and I've already arranged someone
to negotiate with the victims' families.

234
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,200
But don't worry.
They'll keep their mouth shut.

235
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,050
Listen,

236
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,390
take care of their families

237
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,440
so that they can rest assured.

238
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,250
No problem.

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,870
Tianye.

240
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,000
How confident are you?

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
One hundred percent.

242
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,750
Really?

243
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,870
Absolutely.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,870
If we can't resolve this,

245
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,470
our boss will be angry,
and we'll be in trouble.

246
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,150
Tianye, don't scare me like that.

247
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,380
Didn't I tell you

248
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,870
that their building materials
were problematic?

249
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,750
You said it was fine

250
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,960
and told us not to worry.

251
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,120
Now something bad has happened.

252
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,380
Something really bad.

253
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,610
The point is...

254
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,200
The point is that the higher-ups
are coming to investigate me!

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm not trying to scare you.

256
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,580
Everything depends on this move.

257
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,980
Xiaoshuai,

258
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,440
take some men to the construction site.

259
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,780
Taoyi.

260
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
Contact Dr. Chen

261
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
and the funeral parlor.

262
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

263
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,440
Peng,

264
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,630
take Tianfei to talk to
the victims' families.

265
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,080
Let them sign the papers quickly

266
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,390
so we can cremate the bodies.

267
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,790
Why are you making this so complicated?

268
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,790
You should just leave

269
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,990
this kind of thing to Gao
and the others.

270
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,080
Tianye.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
As we discussed before,

272
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,200
Zhang Xin has been with the boss
for so many years,

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,480
so it won't be easy
to drive a wedge between them,

274
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,270
right?

275
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,870
Isn't this our opportunity?

276
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,670
Wait a minute.

277
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,380
I have a question.

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,150
About these construction problems,

279
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,950
did you know about them already?

280
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
Then why didn't you fix it earlier?

281
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,320
If you had, this wouldn't have happened,

282
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
and no one would have died!

283
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,750
Wait, it was Xinrui's problems.

284
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,030
Why should Tianyun get involved?

285
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,320
I'm dealing with it now

286
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,960
because I want to impress the boss.

287
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,870
Three people died!

288
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,220
Well,

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,350
if we had been in charge of this project,

290
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,270
this wouldn't have happened, right?

291
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,270
So, why didn't the boss give it to us?

292
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Because in the boss's heart,

293
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Zhang Xin is more important.

294
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,200
Now that Zhang Xin is in trouble,

295
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,160
it's our chance to climb up.

296
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,940
Tianye, we already have
everything we need.

297
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,660
Why do you still want more?

298
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,770
What do you want?

299
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,750
What are you after?

300
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,810
I don't understand what the point is!

301
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,480
Peng,

302
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,150
let me tell you what I'm trying to do.

303
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,320
We need to grow bigger,

304
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,120
to become the biggest.

305
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,720
Otherwise, others will...

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,870
Aren't we big enough?

307
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,000
Listen, in the future,
there may not be another group like us

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,790
-in Longwan or Zhao Village...
-Us? Is it still us?

309
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,270
I'm the last to know all this.

310
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,270
Is it still us?

311
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,240
Wait, you...

312
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
That's why you're angry, right?

313
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,840
It's not about this!

314
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,030
It's about human lives!

315
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,440
People died!

316
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,900
Human lives!

317
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Haven't you seen anyone die before?

318
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,110
Have you never had blood on your hands?

319
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,960
I've brought everyone into this game,

320
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,220
so let's keep gambling

321
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,710
and win it all,

322
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,020
okay?

323
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't be angry.

324
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,750
Alright.

325
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,170
Go back and make arrangements.

326
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,480
I want to see results tomorrow.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Alright,

328
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,290
It's just a matter of driving a wedge
between them, isn't it?

329
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,410
It's not a big deal, right?

330
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,920
Peng.

331
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,960
Peng, it's okay.

332
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Just relax, Peng.

333
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,960
Relax.

334
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,960
It's no big deal.

335
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
Let's get back to work.

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,730
Uncle Limin,

337
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,030
let's get back to work.

338
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,170
Let's go.

339
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,160
Back to work.

340
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's go.

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Xiaoshuai, let's go.

342
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,380
Xiaoshuai.

343
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,040
Wait a moment.

344
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,320
Come with me to a place later.

345
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,150
Okay.

346
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,270
Come in.

347
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,000
Hanzhou Club

348
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,550
has no blind spots

349
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,480
in my eyes.

350
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,250
Check this out.

351
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,170
Do you recognize this?

352
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,510
This is Hanzhou.

353
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,670
And that?

354
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,890
That's Longwan.

355
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,210
You can take a closer look.

356
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,400
The marks on this map, big or small,

357
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,390
represent the prestigious figures
in Hanzhou.

358
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,390
The bigger the mark,
the greater the power.

359
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,480
Some of them

360
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,510
are with us,

361
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,630
and some

362
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,870
are the connections
we need to maintain daily.

363
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,870
We'll talk about the details later.

364
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
This is the city government, right?

365
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,150
Well,

366
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
he's...

367
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
You don't need to know

368
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
because I'll be there

369
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,040
in the future.

370
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,240
Today is your birthday,

371
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,840
and I have something for you.

372
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,000
Open it.

373
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,600
Your new ID card is ready.

374
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,510
[Name: Ding Baoshuai]

375
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,360
From now on, your name is Ding Baoshuai.

376
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,000
The "Bao" generation from Longwan.

377
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Bao means to protect you.

378
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,720
Today is your birthday,

379
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,910
as well as

380
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240
the day your new life begins.

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,450
[Name: Ding Baoshuai]

382
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,790
Thank you, Uncle Tianye.

[Medical Examination Report]

384
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,270
[Hanzhou City Center Hospital,
Medical Certificate]

385
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,000
Ye,

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
these are the preliminary documents
from the hospital.

387
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
The official medical report

388
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,359
will be ready tomorrow.

389
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,640
Party Secretary Li.

390
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,960
I'm in good health.

391
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,079
How could I have heart disease?

392
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,390
Some illnesses

393
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,970
usually show no symptoms,

394
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,810
but once they flare up,

395
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,560
it's a matter of life and death.

396
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,490
We should believe in science.

397
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,510
If you're sick, get treatment.

398
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,770
Don't feel pressured.

399
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,210
Honestly, heart disease

400
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,590
is manageable

401
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,730
with proper rest

402
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,290
and timely treatment.

403
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
You didn't call me over

404
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,850
just to tell me
I have heart disease, right?

405
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,070
Ye,

406
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,710
everyone has seen

407
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,030
your abilities and contributions.

408
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,540
To be honest,

409
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,600
we do hope you could work
for a few more years.

410
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,970
But using younger cadres

411
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,030
is the irreversible major trend.

412
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,000
It's not up to our wishes.

413
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,400
I understand
why we're using younger cadres

414
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,490
and giving them opportunities.

415
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,890
But I still have cases to solve.

416
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,590
Bringing this up now

417
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,460
might seem sudden.

418
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,320
And I understand

419
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,650
why you can't accept it immediately.

420
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,680
Party Secretary Li, how about this?

421
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,810
I have a suggestion.

422
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,750
There should be a transition period.

423
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,750
What do you think?

424
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,960
Okay.

425
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,110
Please consider
how to hand over your work properly

426
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,640
as soon as you can.

427
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,820
Meanwhile,

428
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,170
we'll also discuss

429
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,550
if there's a new position
suitable for your health condition.

430
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,550
What do you think?

431
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,680
Ye,

432
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,850
there's always more work to do.

433
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,070
You've been working hard your whole life.

434
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,070
It's time to rest.

435
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,830
Okay.

436
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Sir, now that both of you have considered
everything so thoroughly on my behalf,

437
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,350
and I'm about the age to retire anyway,

438
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,930
I'll submit my retirement application.

439
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
We can always count on

440
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,000
our seasoned cadres

441
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
at crucial times.

442
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,760
By the way,

443
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,350
Ye,

444
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,130
who do you think would be suitable

445
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,310
to take your position after you leave?

446
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,200
Yan Ming, I suppose.

447
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,790
He's the executive deputy director

448
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,320
and is familiar
with the bureau's situation.

449
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
But Yan Ming's age

450
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,230
is a bit awkward.

451
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,320
He's not much younger than you, right?

452
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,130
What about Peng Hanzhang?

453
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,510
Peng Hanzhang

454
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,910
doesn't have as much leadership experience
as Yan Ming does.

455
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,810
Party Secretary Li.

456
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,550
I think we should recommend Yan Ming
to the provincial bureau.

457
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,200
Moving from executive deputy director
to director

458
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,590
is the natural progression,

459
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,000
and it won't cause

460
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,790
much disruption to our overall work.

461
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,790
What do you think?

462
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,320
Let's settle on this for now.

463
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,960
We'll discuss it further
at the meeting later.

464
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,550
Okay?

465
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,630
I won't sign it.

466
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,090
My brother died because of you.

[Feng Jiang,
Brother of the deceased worker, Feng Hai]

468
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,850
It wasn't a sudden heart attack.

469
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,720
This guy

470
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,060
is so stubborn.

471
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,070
Who is he?

Feng Jiang.

473
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
His brother Feng Hai died.

Feng Jiang.

475
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,750
Your brother

476
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,030
died from a sudden heart attack.

477
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,110
That's the fact.

478
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,880
You have to accept it

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,110
whether you like it

480
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,270
or not.

481
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,550
No way.

482
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,690
Well,

483
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,210
is the money not enough?

484
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,850
Can money bring my brother back?

485
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,200
Can it?

486
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,270
What are you doing?

487
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,600
What are you going to do?

488
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,950
You won't sign with this hand anyway.

489
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,950
Let's chop it off.

490
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,980

491
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,440
Enough!

492

Peng.

493
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,640
We

494
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,180
don't want to make things
difficult for you.

495
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,760
After all, your brother is gone,

496
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,020
and you must carry on with your lives,

497
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,750
right?

498
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,870
And all of you.

499
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,920
If you're willing to sign it,

500
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I'll make the call

501
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,650
to pay you extra.

502
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,750
If you don't...

503
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,450
I suggest you think carefully.

504
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,370
You can't leave unless you sign it.

505
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,510
Don't make too much noise.

506
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,590

508

to take care of the bodies tonight.

509

[Family Signature: Feng Jiang]

511
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,150
Now that Tianye has given the order,

512

[Chen Liang, Director of Tianyun Hospital]

513
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,280
I will get it done no matter what.

514
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,400
I'll take the bodies

515
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,240
to the crematorium right away.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,830
Let Tianye know when it's done.

517
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,730
Okay.

518
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,510
How's it going?

519
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,160
Everything that needed to be said and done
is taken care of.

520
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,920
Are you sure?

521
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,550
Make some arrangements in the city.

522
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,160
We'll go to the hospital
to visit the injured and put on a show.

523
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
Once the accident report is released,

524
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,280
we'll be able to
keep things under control.

525
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,070
Hope so.

526
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,300
You all need
to keep your heads clear these days.

527
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,680
The police are still
investigating Liu Yi's case.

528
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,410
By police, I mean your brother.

529
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,000
As for the police,

530
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,810
just leave it to me.

531
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,430
Please tell the boss

532
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,000
not to worry.

533
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm your boss too.

534
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,900
Shouldn't you reassure me first?

535
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,510
Yes.

536
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,760
That's right.

537
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,750
Well,

538
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,560
when you have time,
come to Hanzhou Club to relax.

539
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,810
I'm expecting more fun.

540
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,730
No problem.

541
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,240
Be safe.

542
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,550
Tianye.

543
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,350
As he climbs higher in position,
he becomes more annoying.

544
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,000
Soon,

545
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,640
we won't be able to associate with him.

546
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,370
Uncle Limin,

547
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,960
annoying people are easier to control.

548
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,980
Easier to control?

549
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,070
Mentor.

550
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,370
Mai was

551
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,150
on his way here,

552
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,770
but then something urgent
came up at his shop,

553
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,530
so he probably can't make it.

554
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,300
Never mind.

555
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't force him.

556
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,830
That case is still not solved,

557
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,030
so I understand

558
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,920
how he feels.

559
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,880
I wanted to retire with no regrets.

560
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
But now it seems

561
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
I can't.

562
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,300
It's been 12 years.

563
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,280
Yet so many cases remain unsolved.

564
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,550

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,400
I could've helped you.

754
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,960
Just some trivial matters.

755
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,620
There's no need to bother you.

Now you're standing in the front row
when Director Chen visits the patients.

757

This is my hospital.

When the leaders come,
I have to stand by their side.

00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,790
Oh, goodness.

760
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,140
It must be exhausting.

The government is following this matter.

762
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,980
Just rest assured.

763
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,760
Don't worry. I'm not involved.

764
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,250
This is a serious problem,

765
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,110
so it's not my responsibility.

766
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,510

The city officials have come to visit you.

Hope you recover soon.

772
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,750
Okay.

Relax.

780
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Just a small chat.

781
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:33,920
Okay.

782

Why-

Why haven't you left yet?

What do you want to talk about?

788
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,480
Did a reporter just interview you?

789
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,110
Yes,

790
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,370
but I didn't say anything.

791
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,390

I understand.

We're on the same side.

795

It's not your concern.

Of course.

850
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,140
It's like we're enemies.

851
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,430
You're overthinking it.

852
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,420
It's just that I suddenly feel

853
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,760
so distant from them.

854
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,300

858
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,640
if he were there.

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,170
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,550
As the movie line goes,

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,340
"What would happen
if we could go back in time?"

862
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,570
Take a guess.

863
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,110
What would happen?

864
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,240
It would be the same.

865
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,150
You've been single

866
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,970
for so long with no one to talk to

867
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,760
that you always think too much.

868
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
I'm fine being alone.

869
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,240
What's good about that?

870
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,550
I'll ask Ziyi to set you up with someone.

871
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,840
Please don't, Tianye.

872
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm used to this.

873
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,280
Used to what?

874
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,190
Just give it a try,

875
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,450
and you might discover
a whole new world.

876
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,940
It would still be the same.

877
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,160
Now you're throwing my words
right back at me, huh?

878
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,820
This is the place our boss mentioned.

882
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,490
You're good at hiding.

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,510
Do us a favor.

884
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,060
Are you sure Fang Lei is here?

885
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,760
I investigated that female accountant

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,070
Recently, she rented a place
but hasn't been living there.

887
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,930
Fang Lei is very likely to be here.

Call an ambulance.

889
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080

00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,140
to check the scene.

891
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,150
Is this 120?

Hurry up.

902
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,610
Stand up straight.

903
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,780
Choose one.

904
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,230
Sir,

905
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,590
I'm sorry!

906
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,790
Please spare me!

907
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,250
I need to ask you something.

908
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,590
What did Liu Yi tell you
before the incident?

909
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,790
How much do you know about Xinrui Group?

910
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,330
He asked me

911
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,840
to fetch a flash drive

912
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,400
from his drawer in the company

913
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,460
and bring it to him.

914
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,440
Then...

915
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,690
I saw someone leave his house

916
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,250
and drive away.

917
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Where is the flash drive?

918
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,590
I have it.

919
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,610
Did you see who drove to Liu Yi's place?

920
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,150
I don't know.

921
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,670
But I took photos with my phone

922
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,790
of that car.

923
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,170
Your phone.

924
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,400
Here, take it.

925
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,320
Keep the phone.

926
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,570
If anyone asks, show them the photos.

927
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,710
If the police ask who was driving,

928
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,090
just tell them it was Zheng Gao,

929
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,210
understand?

930
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,100
Uncle Tianfei.

931
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,320
Didn't Uncle Tianye say

932
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,030
we should use Fang Lei

933
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,230
to redirect the police's attention
to Zhang Xin?

934
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,490
Why mention Zheng Gao?

935
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,840
If the police see the photos,

936
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,550
tracking down Zhang Xin and Guazi

937
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,880
is just a matter of time.

938
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,520
I just want to set a trap, so they'll take

939
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,510
a longer route.

940
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,890
If Qin Feng falls for it,

941
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,510
we'll kill two birds with one stone.

942
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,790
Uncle Tianfei, but Uncle Tianye said...

943
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,430
Enough.

944
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,220
Listen to me this time.

945
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,650
Don't tell Tianye.

946
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,920
Tomorrow, go to the police station
and turn yourself in.

947
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,480
Take the blame for this.

948
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,860
The police are looking for you anyway.

949
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,960
Just tell them that nobody died

950
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,210
in the accident,

951
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,440
and that you bought
those building materials

952
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,840
because they were cheap,

953
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,480
understand?

954
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,080
How can I take the blame
for something this big?

955
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,480
People died at the construction site,

956
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,020
and it's not my fault!

957
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,110
The building materials
designated by the group

958
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,880
were problematic!

959
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,650
Do you even know
what taking the blame means?

960
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,950
Why else would we try to find you?

961
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,960
If you take the blame for this,

962
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,230
this will be over.

963
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,280
Otherwise, think about it.

964
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,680
Think about your future.

965
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,350
Think about

966
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,320
your family.

967
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,410
I can...

968
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,710
I can do it!

969
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,480
I was

970
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,910
blinded by greed.

971
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,050
I'll do whatever you tell me to do,

972
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,360
but you must promise

973
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,940
to spare my family!

974
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,100
I will certainly

975
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,360
keep my word.

976
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,860
But will you

977
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,000
keep yours?

978
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,920
Look,

979
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,580
in a moment,

980
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,830
we'll make an oath in front of

981
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,840
Lord Guan Yu.

982
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,010
Lord Guan Yu?
