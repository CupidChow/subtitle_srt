do you remember this place?

14
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,470
I gave you a chance. You wouldn't listen,
but insisted on going against me.

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,550
Yes!

191
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,270
Bro.

192
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,000
The police!

193
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,270
Go!

194
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,720
Get down!

195
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,390
Move!

196
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,500
What's wrong with you?

197
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,810
Have you lost your mind?

198
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,360
What are you doing here?

199
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,930
What did you do to Qiao Defu?

200
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,840
Speak up! What did you do?

201
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,770
Let's talk over there.

202
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,830
If you go back there again,
you won't be able to get out.

203
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,890
Do you understand?

204
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,740
Go back where?

205
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,270
I'd rather die than go back in there.

206
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,830
Go back?

207
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,030
Qiao Defu is fine.

208
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,160
He's probably home
with his wife right now.

209
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
If you don't believe me, just ask him.
He's really fine.

210
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,550
You do whatever they tell you to do,

211
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:08,960
huh?

212
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,290
What's in it for you?

213
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,240
Do you pay me?

214
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,200
Su, I'm afraid you might not
live long enough

215
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,730
to spend the money you earn.

216
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,400
You know exactly

217
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,480
what you are to them, right?

218
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,230
You do all the dirty work.

219
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,670
When things go wrong, you take the blame.

220
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,310
They're using you.

221
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,440
Don't you know that?

222
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,080
You always talk about death.

223
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,030
If you're gone, what about your brothers?

224
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,030
Have you thought about that?

225
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,630
Enough.

226
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,610
I know everything.

227
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,950
Everyone has their own fate.

228
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,580
I just do what I can do.

229
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,220
Su, please stop.

230
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,360
Times have changed.

231
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,790
This isn't the era where you can get ahead

232
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,120
just by throwing punches and being loyal.

233
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,680
Mai.

234
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,830
Listen.

235
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,310
In a few days,

236
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,310
after I take care of another matter,

237
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm afraid

238
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,460
I'll have to leave.

239
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,160
Don't worry about the money.

240
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,120
Once I get settled there,

241
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,800
if you're willing,

242
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,920
I'll send someone to get you.

243
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,180
We can leave together.

244
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,450
We'll get out of this place.

245
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,130
Still another matter?

246
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,410
You just won't listen to me, right?

247
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,280
You really want to end up in jail,
don't you?

248
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,920
Fine.

249
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,170
No more matters.

250
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,440
Let's

251
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,090
leave together.

252
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,200
Su.

253
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,640
I've said what I had to say

254
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,830
and given all the advice I could.

255
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,090
As for which path to go,

256
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,030
it's your own choice.

257
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,270
It's you!

258
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,160
Su!

259
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,010
Su, are you okay?

260
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,210
Be careful.

261
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,720
Crazy,

262
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,550
get him! Hurry!

263
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,210
Who did this?

264
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,480
The person in the portrait!

265
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,410
He went that way!

266
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,400
Is he okay?

267
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,880
Call an ambulance!

268
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,060
Lock down this area!

269
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,070
Wen Bo!

270
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,640
Get up.

271
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,810
Is this the emergency center?

272
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,030
[Public Security]

273
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,210
Do you remember

274
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,550
what to say later?

275
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,980
It was all Su Hongbao.

276
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,240
Su Hongbao did it all.

277
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,090
Louder.

278
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,750
It was all Su Hongbao.

279
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,110
Su Hongbao did it all.

280
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,700
Just blame everything on Su Hongbao.

281
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,810
As for your family,

282
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,560
we'll take good care of them.

283
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,200
Go.

284
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,170
Well,

285
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,510
Mentor heard you were injured,

286
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,040
so he rushed over to see you.

287
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,770
You know?

288
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,430
Enough for useless talk.

289
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,160
What about that person? Any news?

290
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
We're searching for him.

291
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,170
Didn't I tell you

292
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,270
not to get him involved?

293
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,920
How did this happen?

294
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,280
They're my legs.

295
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,880
I got myself injured,

296
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,270
and I accept that. Don't blame others.

297
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,600
Stop trying to be a hero, okay?

298
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,530
You weak old man.

299
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,720
If

300
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,070
Qin Feng had been a moment later,

301
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,240
you would've lost your life!

302
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,500
Have you investigated Zhang Xin?

303
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,300
Working on it.

304
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,130
Rome wasn't built in a day.

305
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
They're not stupid.

306
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,470
Oh, Ye.

307
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,080
You were full of this same empty talk

308
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,350
ten years ago.

309
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,590
What did I do ten years ago?

310
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,030
You only talked big,
but never investigated cases!

311
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,830
-How do you know I didn't investigate it?
-What did you do?

312
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,590
-How do you know I didn't?
-I was the one who kept watch on him.

313
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,720
Then investigate it!

314
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,880
Just investigate it!
That's all you need to do!

315
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,480
Okay.

316
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,650
Don't be angry.

317
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,650
Calm down.

318
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,680
Didn't we agree to be nice?

319
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,400
Just came to check on him.

320
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,480
Mentor came all this way to see you.

321
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,900
What is this all about?

322
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,720
Want to argue with me?

323
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,110
Wait until you can stand up first!

324
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,750
Fine.

325
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,420
Keep arguing.

326
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,070
I can't stop you two. Just go ahead.

327
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,150
Just take off your cast

328
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,410
and fight with Mentor.

329
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,640
Captain Qin,

330
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,160
Qiao Defu turned himself in.

331
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,820
He's at the Municipal Bureau.

332
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,610
Alright, got it.

333
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,070
What's wrong?

334
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,970
Qiao Defu turned himself in.

335
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Then hurry back.

336
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,790
If anything happens, call me right away.

337
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,270
Quick.

338
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,110
Keep fighting. It's fine.

339
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,740
Just go! Hurry!

340
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,750
I quit gambling once.

341
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,870
I even thought about
cutting off my finger to quit.

342
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,860
But once I sit at the gambling table

343
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,630
and see those chips,

344
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,570
I just can't walk away.

345
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,110
I owe Su Hongbao so much money.

346
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,370
To pay off my debts,

347
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,860
I borrowed from many friends,

348
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,660
robbing Peter to pay Paul,

349
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,400
and the hole just kept getting bigger.

350
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,300
Su Hongbao insisted I repay him

351
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,090
the debt plus interest

352
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,400
all at once.

353
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,720
He asked me to use
the project funds to pay him back.

354
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,240
It's hundreds of millions of yuan.

355
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,260
If I used that money,

356
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,590
it'd be a capital crime.

357
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
So, I begged him and said,

358
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,000
"Don't rush.

359
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Well, as long as I have the company,

360
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,350
I can make money gradually."

361
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
He said he couldn't wait,

362
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,060
so he tied me up.

363
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,070
He wouldn't let me eat or drink,

364
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,470
forcing me to pay my debt.

365
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,600
Then I thought, I'd rather

366
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,620
go to jail

367
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,560
than wait for him to kill me.

368
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,840
So, when he was distracted,

369
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,650
I escaped and turned myself in.

370
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,420
How long did it take you

371
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,610
to make up the story?

372
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,350
Did you rehearse it in front of a mirror?

373
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,750
No, it's true.

374
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,030
That gold basin...

375
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,110
I bought it for 400 thousand yuan.

376
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,970
About this big, maybe a kilogram.

377
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,420
It's worth more than 400 thousand yuan.

378
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,560
I'm telling the truth.

379
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,390
You owe him so much money,

380
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,240
and he wants to kill you?

381
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,970
He doesn't want the money back?

382
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,960
He already tied you up.

383
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,510
Look at yourself. Do you think

384
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,840
you could slip away without him noticing?

385
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,160
Are you crazy? Or is he crazy?

386
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
If I can't pay it back,

387
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,960
he'll definitely kill me.

388
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,640
Enough.

389
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,920
Let's put this aside.

390
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,370
Do you know whose money you owe?

391
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,610
Su Hongbao's money.

392
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,680
Su Hongbao?

393
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,300
Does Su Hongbao have
that much money to lend you?

394
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,970
Can you figure it out or not?

395
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,680
He Gang's money.

396
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,370
He Gang's money?

397
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,000
So, you know it's He Gang's money.

398
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,240
I warned you long ago

399
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,390
not to gamble,

400
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,410
right?

401
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,400
I went to your place
to tell you in person,

402
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
but you wouldn't listen.

403
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,480
Now that you're in trouble,

404
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,220
you realize

405
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,950
you have no other choice.

406
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,480
I was too arrogant

407
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,720
and rude to you.

408
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,640
I apologize.

409
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,570
So, the real situation is

410
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,090
you owe

411
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,340
He Gang money.

412
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,570
He Gang

413
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,740
sent Su Hongbao

414
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,970
to find you.

415
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,260
He didn't tie you up

416
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,550
to collect the debt for He Gang,

417
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,320
right?

418
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,160
Then

419
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,400
why?

420
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,210
Why? I'm asking you.

421
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Think about it.

422
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,240
Su Hongbao gave me

423
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,770
such a hard time.

424
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,300
My blood pressure kept fluctuating.

425
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,510
And my blood sugar

426
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,990
was so unstable.

427
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,680
I've been in a fog these days,

428
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,420
and I just...

429
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Well,

430
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,280
I kept forgetting things.

431
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,670
Did he mention anything about the project?

432
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,420
I think he did...

433
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,730
Did he?

434
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,040
I forgot.

435
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,260
Okay.

436
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,820
Take your time to think.

437
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,330
I'll give you time.

438
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,280
Now, tell me about
your cooperation with Liu Tianye.

439
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,500
Well,

440
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,690
he wanted to cooperate with me,

441
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
and I had my own plan.

442
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,120
I wanted

443
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,520
to get some money from him

444
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,650
to pay off my debts.

445
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,820
I was too desperate.

446
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,860
About what they did afterward,

447
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,760
I really know nothing about it.

448
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,510
Captain Qin,

449
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,510
I really should've listened to you.

450
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,580
I got on the wrong boat.

451
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,460
It's all my fault.

452
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,010
I shouldn't have gambled
in the first place!

453
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,830
So,

454
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,690
you cooperated with Liu Tianye

455
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,200
just to get some money

456
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,480
to pay off your debts,

457
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,070
right?

458
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,880
Yes.

459
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,440
Fine.

460
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,490
I'm done here.

461
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,750
This old cunning fox

462
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,010
must've rehearsed it many times at home.

463
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,640
I have no more questions.

464
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,410
Make a note about
how he scammed Liu Tianye.

465
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,350
I've written it down.

466
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,940
Okay.

467
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,510
Take your time to reflect.

468
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm done talking with you.

469
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,690
Captain Qin.

470
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,910
Captain Qin, I'm telling the truth.

471
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,830
Captain Qin, I'm telling the truth!

472
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,430
Officer.

473
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,550
Indeed, there's been some tension

474
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,750
between my brother Gang and Su Hongbao.

475
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,090
But I don't know the details.

476
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,990
Plus, why would he have a gun?

477
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,900
At the company, we each have

478
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,490
separate responsibilities.

479
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,570
On the day of the incident,

480
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,330
I was at an auction bidding on

481
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,180
a plum vase from the late Song dynasty.

482
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,240
I won the bid.

483
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,050
There should be records.
You can check them.

484
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,820
My brother

485
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
is an impulsive person.

486
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,110
I often tell him

487
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,270
not to hang around
with those shady people,

488
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,200
not to associate with them,

489
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
but he wouldn't listen to me.

490
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,910
If

491
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,310
he contacts me,

492
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,350
I'll definitely persuade him
to turn himself in.

493
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,280
Does he have another phone number?

494
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,270
Yes.

495
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,030
I sent him a message this morning.

496
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,370
You can check my phone.

497
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
There's a record.

498
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,330
Alright,

499
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,960
thanks for your cooperation.

500
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,030
If you have any news about him,

501
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,630
please tell us immediately.

502
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,290
Of course.

503
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,030
Are you two

504
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,360
working with Zhang Xin from Xinrui Group?

505
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,440
Zhang Xin?

506
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,160
That name sounds so familiar.

507
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,950
But I don't know this person.

508
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,250
Maybe Gang has something to do
with this person.

509
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,800
Mr. He, you're indeed
a well-read and cultured man.

510
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,200
You know the concept
of cutting off one's arm to save the body.

511
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,250
I don't quite understand.

512
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,970
What your brother did is illegal.

513
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,320
We hope

514
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,410
you can learn from his mistake.

515
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,350
Okay.

516
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,880
[Deyue Seafood Restaurant]

517
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,110
The main dish is here.

518
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,440
Braised pork knuckles with oysters.

519
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,030
It's a great dish.

520
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,469
It conveys good meaning.

521
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,000
Oysters

522
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
mean "good fortune".

523
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
And pork knuckles

524
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,670
mean "in hands".

525
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,230
Right?

526
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,480
Well, Ms. Zhou's blessings

527
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,550
are as beautiful as she is.

528
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,949
She's wishing us
good fortune in our hands,

529
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,630
right?

530
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,190
Ms. Zhou,

531
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll toast to you.

532
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,840
I'll skip the drinks. You guys go ahead.

533
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,639
I have other guests to attend to.

534
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,980
Okay, go ahead.

535
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,489
This is awesome.

536
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,100
From now on,

537
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,040
Hanzhou will be ours to take.

538
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,340
As for Ma Jin

539
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,659
and He Biao,

540
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,159
they have to step aside.

541
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,480
Right?

542
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,610
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

543
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,120
I heard from the hospital

544
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,190
that Su didn't make it.

545
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,620
It's good news.

546
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,740
Now we're clean.

547
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,070
It proves

548
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,140
we made the right choice

549
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,640
with this firewall.

550
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,110
I'll make a toast.

551
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,350
To Su.

552
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,400
To Su.

553
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Come on.

554
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,240
Tianye.

555
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
How's it going

556
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,170
with He Biao?

557
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,550
We can talk to him.

558
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
However, now that Su is gone,

559
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,850
we need to find Lin quickly.

560
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Got it.

561
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,840
Mr. He,

562
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,490
I heard that you just left
the police station.

563
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,720
Is everything okay?

564
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,170
Thank you, Tianye.

565
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,210
The talk with your brother went well.

566
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,990
He still doesn't know

567
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,160
who made Qiao Defu turn himself in.

568
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,710
You can rest assured.

569
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,660
Qiao Defu

570
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,390
won't sell you out.

571
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,790
Well, maybe

572
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,320
we should call a truce.

573
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,530
Su is dead.

574
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,070
And your brother

575
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,800
can't stay in Hanzhou anymore.

576
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,010
If you need help,

577
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,450
I can send Gang out.

578
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,630
You'll go back to your Grand Paradise,

579
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,630
and I'll continue
my construction business.

580
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,630
What do you think?

581
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,600
I see.

582
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,260
You want me to

583
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,480
sacrifice a piece and admit defeat, right?

584
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,510
Tianye.

585
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,350
Even if a pawn crosses the river,

586
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,190
it still can't become a rook.

587
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,520
You don't know who'll have the last laugh.

588
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,260
Think about it.

589
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
No need.

590
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,960
Wish you and Ms. Zhang

591
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,490
a successful cooperation.

592
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,670
In a few days,

593
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,650
I'll send you a big gift.

594
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,910
Gang,

595
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,530
how's your injury?

596
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,510
Muzhi.

597
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,190
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

598
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,070
Don't worry.

599
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,120
Don't come over these days.

600
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,420
Wait for a while.

601
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,220
The police might be watching you.

602
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,600
Just be careful.

603
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
Thanks, Young Mr. He.

604
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,560
Muzhi,

605
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,760
today...

606
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,280
How's the weather outside?

607
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,610
The weather outside

608
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,440
is not great.

609
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,440
Liu Tianye called me.

610
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,050
He wants to talk.

611
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,320
Muzhi.

612
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,650
It was my fault.

613
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,000
I messed it up.

614
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,640
I fell into their trap. I deserved this.

615
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,960
Muzhi.

616
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,540
Just leave me alone.

617
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,970
Don't hold a grudge against them.

618
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,840
I don't want to drag you down anymore.

619
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,980
Now that they've reached out,

620
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,490
just talk to them.

621
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,740
Gang.

622
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,230
I have nothing to say to them.

623
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,650
I'm not holding a grudge

624
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,510
but holding the stakes of our lives.
