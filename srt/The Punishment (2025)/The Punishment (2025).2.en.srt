Welcome.

63
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,079
Last time, I didn't think

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360

a few guns this time.

67

I'm sure all your guns are good, Mr. Ma.

the problem
is that shooting habits is banned.

Those people have been operating

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,750
have you ever

155
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,810
thought about why they want our land?

156
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,190
Let's suppose this is Hanzhou,

158
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,270
This is Hanzhou Port.

159
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,830
And this is Longwan, alright?

160
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,600
When national highways, provincial roads,

162
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,560
the local economy will soar.

163
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,480
By then, this place

164
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,240
will no longer be a small fishing village.

165
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,160
Instead, it will be

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,950
the economic center of Hanzhou.

167
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,240
E-Everyone's fighting over this land.

168
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,170
Why should we sit on the sidelines?

169
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,000
Tianye has a point.

170
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,870
That's all well and good,

171
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,360
but we don't have money.

172
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,130
Then let's work it out.

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,440
If we really go for it,

174
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,610
will Zhao Village cooperate?

175
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,850
I don't trust them.

176
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,950

178
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
How do we know if we don't try?

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,830
You still don't understand what I mean.

180

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,750
I've discovered today

191
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,960
that he is biased and partial.

192
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,120
We can't fight them off.

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Look,
if you are to make something of yourself,

194
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
you have to fight others.

195
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,750
We cannot miss out on

196
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,800
what everyone is going for.

197
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,720
I can't argue with you.

198
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,650
Tianye, Tianye.

199
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't rush.

200
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,580
What we are

201
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
doing is gambling,

202
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,610
with our lives.

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,660
I'll be the first to take the risk.

204
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,870
Who are you risking your life against now?

205
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,920
Cut it out.

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
You're too old to be so childish.

207
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,260

208
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,160
-Uncle Limin. Why are you all here today?
-Feng.

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,390
What is it with you?

210
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,510
You didn't come back
for the ancestral worship ceremony.

211
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,720
I was really held up

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
by something today,

213
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,320
so I couldn't make it.

214
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,160
Feng!

215
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
During today's ceremony,

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
Luo Bo and his people
came to mess with us again.

217
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,500
Luo Bo showed up again?

218
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
It's like he's everywhere.

219
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,000
What did he come for?

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,750
I was just talking with Uncle Limin
about these matters...

221
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,200
Alright. Stop it.

222
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,390
It was no big deal.

223
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,960
You must be hungry, right?

224
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,870
I saved you some food from the ceremony.

225
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,799
I'm also hungry.

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay. I'll reheat it.

227
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Everyone, stay for dinner.

228
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,630
No need.

229
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,200
You guys eat.

230
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,060
We're leaving.

231
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,960
You should both

232
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,790
stay and eat with us,

233
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,270
so I can have a proper discussion
with you.

234
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay then.

235
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,510
I heard your conversation

236
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,630
just now.

237
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,690
You may resume it some other time.

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
-Alright.
-We're leaving.

239
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,600
Take care.

240
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,760
-Sure.
-Take care, Uncle Limin.

241
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,530
I'll go reheat the food.

242
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,080
What's the matter, Tianye?

243
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,030
Your fish is ready. Eat while it's hot.

244
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,400
Thanks, Mom.

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,670
Come eat.

246
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,150
The fish smells amazing.

247
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,150
I smelt it from far away.

248
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,270
You did?

249
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,030
He refused to let me make it

250
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,960
and insisted on cooking it for you.

251
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,550
You insisted on cooking it for me?

252
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,270
Didn't you ask for it? Eat up.

253
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,670

What do you think?

256
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,150
Your cooking has really improved.

257
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,120
It's more flavory than before.

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,180

259

Let me try it.

260

Not bad, huh?

261
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,900
Tianye,

262
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,720
you said Luo Bo stopped by today.

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,580
What happened?

264
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,150
He brought a bunch of people
to cause trouble.

265
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,720
I think

266
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,360
he did it just to spite us.

267
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,950
What was the trouble?

268
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,720
Did they assault

269
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,650
and hurt anyone?

270
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,080
No, they didn't.

271
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,470
They just brought
many prominent figures here

272
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
and voiced their views
about our ancestral hall,

273
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,660
declaring to tear it down.

274
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,910
They really got some nerve.

275
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,200
Tear down our ancestral hall?

276
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
They threatened and sweet talked,

277
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,630
only trying to rent that land.

278
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,490
How can we let them have their way?

279
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,150
Why should we rent it to them?

280
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,320
That's our own land.

281
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,910
We can do whatever we want with it,

282
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,510
right?

283
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,240
Even if we are to rent it out,
it won't be to them.

284
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
They're not good people.

285
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,240
Actually,
I don't think it's a serious issue.

286
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,150
Let's just live our lives

287
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,720
and mind our own business.

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,200
Why should we care about them,

289
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,670
right?

290
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
I think

291
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,690
that's a nice place
to set up a logistics company.

292
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
What do you think?

293
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,750
Is that your plan?

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,790
It sounds good,

295
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,810
doesn't it?

296
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
Why let others develop the land

297
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,840
when we can do it ourselves,

298
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,390
right?

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,720
Besides, Tianye is very smart.

300
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720

for him.

302
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,750
It's also for the good of Longwan,
isn't it?

303
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,210
Tell Uncle Limin about it.

I'll go check it out.

308
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,880
I'll take a look too.

309
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll go. You enjoy the fish.

310

Go to the power supply bureau
to figure it out now, okay?

318
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,390
I need to hurry to the factory.

319
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm afraid the fans in the chicken coop
might stop running.

320
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay.

321
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
Alright. That's all.

The driver who hit your mother
is at the Rome Hotel.

379

Got it.

You should hurry there too.

381

I have a big present for you.

382

What do you mean?

383
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,120
To the Rome Hotel.

384

Be quick.

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,130
You're here. Sit down.

388
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,000
Did you finish the task?

389
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,530
Yes. Just rest assured.

390
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,900
I've got the pay prepared.

391
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,260
Mr. Luo specifically asked me
to remind you

392
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,590
to keep your mouth shut.

393
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,810
What are you doing?

394
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,080
What's this for?

395

What are you recording?

396
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,820
I'm a police officer.

397

All of you, stay still.

398

Give me your phone!

399
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,930
Give me your phone.

400
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,750
Come on.

401
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,610
Come get it.

402
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,480
How very bold of you,

403
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,910
for attacking me
after I told you I'm a police officer.

404
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,150

Chief Zhang, you're finally here.

407
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,080
Where's Qin Feng?

408
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,870
He's inside.

409
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,150
Why did you let him go up alone?

410
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,120
I didn't mean to,

411
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,720
but I had to wait here for you.

412
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,480
All the evidence is here.

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,680

414
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,630
Process the suspects accordingly.

415

Got it?

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,560
I heard what happened to your mother.

[Rome Hotel]

421
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,480
Don't bring that up.
It has nothing to do with this.

422
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,790
This is just a coincidence.

423
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,080
Contact relevant departments
when you're back.

424
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,720
Shut this place down if necessary.

425
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,150
Okay.

426

You're asking me?

429
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,109
I should be the one
asking what this is about!

430
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,810
Mr. Luo.

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,790
Are you running a martial arts school

432
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,730
or a hotel here?

433
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,030
[Rome Hotel]

434
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,829
There is even illegal gambling.

435

All of these people

436
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,240
are outsourced security guards.

437
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't know any of them.

438
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,420
Who hired them?

439
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,000
Mr. Luo,

440
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,230

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,550
Who are you?

442
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,330
The security supervisor.

443
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,130
You're also outsourced, right?

444
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,880
Yes.

Right.

You hired these people?

I did.

Did you know about this stuff?

455
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,110
No, I didn't.

Yes.

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,280
What can it be?

488

But...

490
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,480
the problem doesn't lie in the pay.

Losing this land means losing your home.

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,730
is not open to negotiation?

566

Okay.

572

Let me through, please.

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,790
Thank you.

Before Xiaoyue's incident,

582
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,880
his confidential informant, Wang Ming,

583
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,540
was actually taken away
by two police officers.

584
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,440
What kind of surveillance camera is this?

585
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,700
Everything's blurry.

586
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,030
The officers' badge numbers are unclear.

587
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,550
You'll have to investigate it internally.

588
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,680
I've asked around.

589
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,440
Nobody arrested him.

590
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,480
I doubt if these two people are really

591

592
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,370
Besides, that's a fake license plate.

in a haystack?

Take my advice.

637
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,750
Smooth things over with the mayor quickly.

638
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,720
Then the power will be instantly restored.

639
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
There's no maintenance underway.

640
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,500
It all depends on what the mayor says.

641

The village has electricity again,

642
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,680

is still out of power.

662

663

Then, I inquired someone

664
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,070

753
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,160
Crazy.

754
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,580
I examined both police uniforms.

755
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,550
The badge numbers are wrong.
Those are fake uniforms.

756
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,310
Besides, the billiard hall owner probably

757
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,590
owes those guys money.

758
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,960
I just called Chief Zhang for information.

759
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,640
The billiard hall owner's surname is Qian.

760
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,070
He's a gambler
with complicated connections.

761
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,000
His creditors have pressed him
for repayment with violence before.

762
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
This is quite a mess.

763
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,830
Is he around?

764
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,550
Yes, upstairs.

00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:55,990

Wait.

This area falls outside our jurisdiction.

768
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,200
Shouldn't we invite

769
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,290
Chief Zhang over
before carrying out an investigation?

770
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,690
Why involve Chief Zhang?

771
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,240
Who mentioned investigations?

772
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,000
No more dawdling.
It'll just be a quick chat.

00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,040
You stay put.

776
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,960
Why?

777
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,670
You need help with this investigation.

778
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,330
I already told you
this is not an investigation.

779
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,480
There will just be a few questions.

780
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,739
A simple inquiry it is.

781
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800

It's been a while.
Do you recall meeting me?

792
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,620
I think I do.

793

It's coming back to you now.

794
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,110

No, no, no.

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay.

940
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,710
How can I

941
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,810
help?

942
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,880
Off you go.

943
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,770
Thanks for the hard work.

944
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,500
My pleasure.

945
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,960
Hello, sir.

946
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,740
Just a quick report.

947
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,510
The new bureau director
will take office tomorrow.

948
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,370
I've prepared a nice gift for him.

949
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,770
In addition,

950
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,910
could you think of a way

951
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,500
to have Qin Feng

952
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,920
locked up for a while?

953
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,000
Great.

954
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,670
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

955
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,800
Director Peng.

956
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,450
Director Peng,

957
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,590
what exactly did Qin Feng

958
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,910
do yesterday?

959
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,370
Those at the station told me

960
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,120
he assaulted someone.

961
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,440
What an outrage!

962
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,900
Shortly after the Hu Xiaoyue incident,

963
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,590
he pulled a stunt like that.

964
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,530
What is he up to?

965
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,510
The truth hasn't been figured out yet.

966
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,510
Watch your mouth.

967
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,840
Yes.

968
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,480
Peng!

969
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,550
Director Yan.

970
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,400
Director Yan.

971
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,980
The two of you...

972
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,190
[Yan Ming, Executive Deputy Director
of Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

973
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,520
came quite early today.

974
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,710
We're here to welcome the new director.

975
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,640
Better be early.

976
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,080
Where are the others?

977
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,540
What time is it now?

978
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,880
This is huge disrespect.

979
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,510
Yes.

980
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,880
They should be here soon.

981
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,810
It's about time.

982
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,640
Director Yan,

983
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,910
about Qin Feng's matter...

984
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
what's your opinion?
