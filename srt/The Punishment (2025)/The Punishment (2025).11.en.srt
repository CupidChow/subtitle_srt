00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,240
Let him do it.

194
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,720
Yeah. Yeah.

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,750
I'm the legal representative now.

196
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,600
You're serving me this dish?

197
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,270
Another day.

198
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,030
We'll have a continuous banquet.

199
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,080
Why don't you prepare some lobster?

200
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,550
Right?

201
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,910
Jiangyong.

202
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,320
Look.

203
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,400
Say the legal representative's
name out loud.

204
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,000
Let him know.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,630
Qin Taoyi!

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
Rebelling, huh?

207
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
-Rebels all look like this.
-Jiangyong.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Our logistics company
is officially registered now.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,630
We can start operations tomorrow.

210
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,150
Time to get to work.

211
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,080
I decide when we start working.

212
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,670
Let's start.

213
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,080
What?

214
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,550
So you're hitting the boss now?

215
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,510
Pretty tough, aren't you?

216
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:29,960
Okay.

217
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,510
Tianye.

218
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,250
You're playing a dangerous game.

219
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,480
I've got your brother now.

220
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,620
Did you hear that?

221
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,060
Then bring the gold bars.

222
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,760
Come alone.

223
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,070
What's wrong?

224
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,240
Just a prank call.

225
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,700
I need to step out for a bit.

226
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Why's he leaving?

227
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,030
Isn't he eating?

228
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:22,950
Jiangyong.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,550
I heard something strange

230
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,360
on the phone.

231
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,840
Captain Zhong, Luo Bo must have fled.

232
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,220
I'm not so sure.

233
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,500
Knowing Luo Bo's personality,

234
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,630
Hanzhou won't be peaceful for a while.

235
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,360
Liu.

236
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,320
Yes?

237
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,360
Has the border check been initiated?

238
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,020
Yes, it has.

239
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,630
Also,

240
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,060
we need to check
those surveillance cameras

241
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,600
at the intersections near the Rome Hotel

242
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,670
as soon as possible.

243
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,200
Yes, sir.

244
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,110
Bian Jing.

245
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,240
The stations, docks, and airport—

246
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:54,530
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

247
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,530
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

248
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,130
have you stationed people there?

249
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,510
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

250
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,360
[Incoming call from Jiangyong]

251
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,020
Yes, I have.

252
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,880
Feng isn't answering his phone.

253
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,720
I'll send him a message.

254
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,780
Send him a message.

255
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,870
Feng.

256
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,550
Something might have happened.

257
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,710
We're secretly following Tianye.

258
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,510
Call back ASAP.

259
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:28,930
[Send]

260
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,630
Jiangyong, you don't think

261
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,400
anything will go wrong, right?

262
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,570
No, it won't.

263
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,860
Stay on him.

264
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,520
Tianfei.

265
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,080
Tianfei.

266
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,790
Tianye.

267
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,000
Tianye!

268
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,860
Tianye!

269
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,870
Tianye!

270
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm fine.

271
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,310
Where's my money?

272
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,790
Let him go

273
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,530
and I'll give you the money right away.

274
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,550
Back then,

275
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,820
Mr. Ma told me

276
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
that you are excellent.

277
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,160
I didn't believe it before.

278
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,840
Now I realize

279
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,900
he is indeed excellent.

280
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,670
Tianye!

281
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,540
Luo Bo!

282
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,550
Luo Bo!

283
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,440
Tianye!

284
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,180
Luo Bo!

285
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,390
Luo Bo.

286
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,050
If you're man enough,

287
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,240
untie me

288
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,150
and let's fight one-on-one!

289
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,120
Let me go!

290
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,600
Don't worry,

291
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,750
your turn is coming.

292
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,530
Let go!

293
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,580
Did you think

294
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,000
sending your brother to spy on me

295
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,350
was so clever

296
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,220
that you'd definitely win?

297
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,460
Did you ever imagine this day would come?

298
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,670
Don't you want the money?

299
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,680
I'll give you all the money.

300
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,950
Just let us go.

301
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,640
This isn't about money anymore.

302
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,320
I don't need money.

303
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm a wanted man now.

304
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,860
Before I leave,

305
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,210
taking a few people down with me

306
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,400
would make me happy.

307
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,890
You two brothers

308
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,880
can go to hell

309
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
and wait for me there.

310
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,320
Tianye, let's go!

311
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,150
Come on, let's go!

312
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,830
Stop fighting!

313
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,190
Tianye!

314
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,000
Run!

315
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,720
Hurry!

316
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,350
Be gentle.

317
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,310
My arm is broken.

318
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,310
Police!

319
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,340
Stop fighting!

320
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,980
Get him!

321
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,640
Tianye,

322
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,470
let's go!

323
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,230
Hurry up!

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Get in the car, quick!

325
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,210
Jiangyong!

326
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,920
Tianfei, let's go!

327
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,660
Jiangyong!

328
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,880
Jiangyong, don't fall asleep!

329
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,440
Jiangyong!

330
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,030
Jiangyong, wake up!

331
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,760
Don't sleep!

332
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,900
Stay awake!

333
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,160
Tianfei, press on it!

334
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Press!

335
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,480
Press harder, keep pressure on it!

336
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,070
Tianye, where's the towel?

337
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,530
Tianye.

338
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,880
Get me another towel from the front!

339
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,350
Get another one!

340
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,150
-Hurry.
-Yes.

341
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,880
Tianye!

342
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,580
Tianye!

343
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,920
Tianye!

344
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,700
Tianye!

345
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,240
Taoyi,

346
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
hand me the towel, quick!

347
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,530
Jiangyong!

348
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,810
Jiangyong, wake up!

349
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,110
Don't sleep, Jiangyong.

350
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,770
Stay awake.

351
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,970
Jiangyong.

352
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,060
It's a bit cold.

353
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,800
Jiangyong.

354
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,690
Tianfei.

355
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,220
Are you okay?

356
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,870
I'm fine, Jiangyong.

357
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm okay.

358
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,280
Where's Tianye?

359
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,850
Tianye.

360
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,530
Tianye.

361
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,480
Tianye.

362
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,590
Wake up, Tianye.

363
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,220
Tianye.

364
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,790
Tianye.

365
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,120
Say something, Tianye.

366
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,310
It's okay.

367
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,810
Jiangyong, he's fine.

368
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,540
It's okay.

369
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,540
Crazy.

370
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,280
Keep them under control.

371
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,900
No more fighting.

372
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,930
I know.

373
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,110
I'll watch them, Jiangyong.

374
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,920
Don't worry.

375
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,960
Where are we going now?

376
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,280
To the hospital.

377
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,030
No.

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,650
Home.

379
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,360
Home.

380
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,540
Okay.

381
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,830
Home.

382
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,070
Let's go home.

383
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Taoyi.

384
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,860
Hurry up.

385
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,640
Hurry up.

386
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,530

The Municipal Bureau

577
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,580
isn't under my control.

578
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,920
What I can do,

579
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
I'll certainly try my best.

580
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,400
I've never lied to you all these years.

581
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,960
Well, when you talk like this,

582
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,750
it sounds like you're helping me for free.

583
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,440
That's not the relationship
we used to have.

584
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,480
Well, then what is our relationship?

585
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,880
You tell me.

586
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,940
Do I need to spell it out?

587
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,640
Here we go again.

588
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,060
What do you mean "again"?

589
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,480
Back then,

590
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,430
your father was hospitalized,
needed surgery, and you had no money.

591
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,340
Your wife wanted a divorce.

592
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,330
You were desperate.

593
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,400
Who gave you money?

594
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,170
I gave you money
and found connections for you.

595
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,000
Right?

596
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Your gratitude to me then was so great

597
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,200
that you would have died for me.

598
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,330
Have you forgotten?

599
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,640
It's because I was grateful to you

600
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,830
that all these years

601
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,480
I've done so many things for you.

602
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,550
Those were all against my conscience.

603
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,570
What I owed you,

604
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,480
I've pretty much paid back, haven't I?

605
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,200
Is that so?

606
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,570
Is this how people behave?

607
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,040
Let me ask you,

608
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,520
what did you do for me
before I helped you?

609
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,290
Anything?

610
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,000
Nothing, right?

611
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,720
It was only later,

612
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,510
you felt guilty

613
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,040
that you started
helping me with some matters.

614
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,190
It was just getting me some information,

615
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,290
and I still paid you 200,000.

616
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,880
You said you owed me.

617
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,070
I haven't seen you return

618
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,130
that 200,000 to me.

619
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,110
All these years,

620
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,960
look at how well

621
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,350
you've been living.

622
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,560
Thanks to whom? Isn't it me?

623
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,550
I haven't heard you
complain about losing sleep.

624
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,200
Fine.

625
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,960
I've told you already,

626
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
they're watching me now.

627
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,310
And you still want me to push forward.

628
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,830
If something happens to me,

629
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,880
it won't be good for either of us.

630
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,440
Can we just leave

631
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,070
Song Hao alone for now?

632
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,200
Even if you take care of him,

633
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,330
what good will it do?

634
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,720
You have too many holes

635
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,980
that can't be plugged.

636
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,310
We've made enough money.

637
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,140
Getting out safely now

638
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,350
would benefit both of us.

639
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,350
I understand.

640
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,880
So you see the storm coming

641
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,440
and want to abandon ship, is that it?

642
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,550
It's not that I want to leave the ship.

643
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,550
It's your ship that's

644
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,260
not sailing steady anymore.

645
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,480
You should know when to stop.

646
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,830
Okay?

647
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm tired of living in fear

648
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
every single day!

649
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,700
Let me tell you something.

650
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,110
This ship

651
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,650
is nowhere near its destination.

652
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,530
You want to leave? Fine.

653
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Your only option is to jump into the sea.

654
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,030
Even if you're not afraid,

655
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,480
you can't let your wife and children

656
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,020
become shark food with you.

657
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,160
Ma Jin!

658
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,830
Innocent family members shouldn't suffer.

659
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,550
What you're saying is dishonorable.

660
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,880
What honor do I owe you?

661
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,540
Why are you glaring at me?

662
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,489
Talk about honor with you?

663
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,810
Calling you "Sir" is already a courtesy.

664
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,510
Get out!

665
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,280
Wait!

666
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,290
Find him in 3 days.

667
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,000
Today is also Tianye's birthday.

668
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,190
[1990, Longwan Village, Hanzhou City]

669
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,710
Look at the trouble you've caused.

670
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,840
When Mom comes back,

671
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,640
you'll definitely get scolded.

672
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,880
Tianye,

673
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,460
it's your birthday today.

674
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
We just thought

675
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,190
we'd make you some scrambled eggs.

676
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,550
But that doesn't mean you can steal.

677
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,630
Tianye. Tianye!

678
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,280
Tianye.

679
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,880
I made you sweet egg soup.

680
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,960
Eat it while it's hot.

681
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
Thanks, Yan.

682
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,940
You eat first.

683
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,760
No, Tianye.

684
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,710
It's your birthday today.

685
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,910
You should eat first.

686
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,080
Tianye, please go ahead and eat.

687
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,040
Alright.

688
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,960
Let's all three of us

689
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,760
eat together.

690
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,420
Who stole the eggs?

691
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,660
Come to my place.

692
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,120
Why are you all standing? Come sit down.

693
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,330
Have a seat.

694
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,140
Jiangyong.

695
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,670
Did you make all these?

696
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,770
My wife made them.

697
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,230
Here.

698
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,280
I learned how to make it from someone.

699
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,340
It looks a bit ugly.

700
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,070
But it should taste good.

701
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,070
Light the candle.

702
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,790
It'll definitely be delicious.

703
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,280
Make a wish.

704
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,440
Make a wish.

705
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,000
Okay.

706
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,230
Come on.

707
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,400
-Let’s blow it together.
-Together.

708
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,150
One, two, three.

709
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,710
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

710
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,710
Tianye.

711
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,630
Tianye.

712
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,360
Tianye.

713
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,190
Tianye, can you hear Mom talking?

714
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,090
Can you hear me?

715
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,630
Tianye.

716
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,110
Tianye.

717
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,800
Tianfei and the others are doing fine.

718
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,510
The doctors are treating them.

719
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,360
Don't worry.

720
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,760
Don't worry.

721
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,330
Jiangyong...

722
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,630
Tianye.

723
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,920
You need to recover well.

724
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,090
Get better.

725
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,480
We still need to protect Longwan.

726
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,850
We must guard Longwan well.

727
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,510
Listen to me, Tianye.

728
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,840
Tianye.

729
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,450
We're all here.

730
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:45,550
Tianye.

731
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,210
The patient has suffered
severe brain trauma.

732
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,590
Aphasia and emotional agitation

733
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,940
are possible outcomes.

734
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,550
When will he recover?

735
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,210
This will heal over time,

736
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,190
but

737
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,010
there might be permanent aftereffects,

738
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,760
such as headaches and the like.

739
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,450
Is there nothing

740
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,320
else we can do

741
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,110
to help him recover a bit faster

742
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,840
or

743
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,550
more completely?

744
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,370
I'll prescribe some painkillers for now

745
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,760
and see

746
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,130
how he progresses.

747
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:46,350
[Doctor's Office]

748
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,400
He's getting better, right?

749
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,490
Here.

750
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,280
Take your medicine.

751
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,320
Ziyi.

752
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,150
There's no rush for him
to take the medicine.

753
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,750
He can take it later
if he feels uncomfortable.

754
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,480
Yan.

755
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,720
Take Mom home first.

756
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,280
Don't stay up here anymore.

757
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,550
It might wear Mom out.

758
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
I'll stay here and keep watch today.

759
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,510
Mom.

760
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,710
I'll take you home

761
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,880
and get some rest.

762
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,180
That's fine.

763
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,590
I'll go home
and make something for him to eat.

764
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,120
Tianye, tell me
if you want anything special.

765
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,920
Fine.

766
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,800
Don't worry.

767
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,000
Ziyi, go back with them.

768
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,500
I'll be going then.

769
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,290
Yan, call me if anything happens.

770
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,830
Are you tired?

771
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,990
Shall I recline the bed

772
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,570
for you to get some sleep first?

773
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,120
Tianye.

774
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,920
This time,

775
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,280
you've had a brush with death.

776
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Don't keep things
to yourself when you have problems.

777
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,400
We're brothers.

778
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,470
We'll support this family together.

779
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,150
[Mission: Compassion, Aid,
and Holistic Recovery]

780
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,190
In the past,

781
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,650
didn't you give me this lucky coin?

782
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,960
It really works.

783
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,190
Since I got this,

784
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,510
all these years,

785
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,290
I haven't had any troubles.

786
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,670
Today I'm giving this

787
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,320
back to you.

788
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,840
I hope

789
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,250
you keep it with you

790
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,440
and never get hurt again.

791
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,480
Don't lose it.

792
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,800
Hold it tight.
