00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,550
Wang Xu...

190
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,740
had a sudden heart attack a few days ago

191
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,670
and passed away.

192
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,130
I heard about it.

193
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,980
Now that he's gone,

194
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,280
Ma Jin is the only one
who knows the mastermind

195
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,300
behind everything

196
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,580
that Ji Zhujiang mentioned previously.

197
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,830
Ji Zhujiang's confession shows

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,850
that there are many people behind Ma Jin.

199
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,070
But Ji Zhujiang

200
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,550
has no idea who these people actually are.

201
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,480
All he knows is

202
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,000
that they only take orders
from one person,

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
who is usually

204
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,550
referred to as "Boss."

205
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,190
I think

206
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,660
this person is probably related

207
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
to the Xu Li case.

208
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,060
They have a strict hierarchy...

209
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,160
What kind of person...

210
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,290
could this "Boss" be?

211
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
No matter who this person is,

212
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,000
how powerful and how deeply

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,260
concealed he or she is,

214
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
we must root this culprit out.

215
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,480
Chu!

216
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,610
Ye.

217
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,780
Ye,

218
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,870
Qin Feng

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,880
is quite good.

220
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,400
He made great contributions
to the case about Ma Jin and Luo Bo.

221
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
He deserves a promotion,

222
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,030
to deputy chief

223
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
or even chief.

224
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,050
He stands a high chance of both.

225
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,910
It depends on his performance.

226
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,210
The case is closed.

227
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,870
Why not go back to the provincial office?

228
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,730
I'm afraid not.

229
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,150
As I told you,

230
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,750
I'm like a falling leave
returning to my roots.

231
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,880
Do you have unfinished business here?

232
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,730
Hu Xiaoyue's death

233
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,420
is attributed to someone

234
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,630
besides Wang Xu and Ma Jin.

235
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,500
Ji Zhujiang confessed

236
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,830
that he and his fellows
worked for one person,

237
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,740
who he had never met.

238
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,030
Despite all that time searching,

239
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,030
we've got no lead.

240
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,590
I believe

241
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
this person

242
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,090
is the real mastermind.

243
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,750
Actually, I think it's time

244
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,570
you let your mentees work on it.

245
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,470
Give young people a chance
to gain experience.

246
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,320
You're going to

247
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
retire in just a few years.

248
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,780
Why tire yourself out?

249
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,750
Exactly because retirement is approaching,

250
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,560
I'd hate to leave the force with regrets.

251
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,480
I must catch this mastermind,

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,700
or I can't face my mentees.

253
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,360
Alright.

254
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,240
If my support

255
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
is needed in the line of duty,

256
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,800
just let me know.

257
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay.

258
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,690
[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

259
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,080
You...

260
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,400
Aren't you...

261
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,760
Aren't you...

262
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,500
Isn't he Mr. Ye?

263
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,800
Let me reintroduce myself.

264
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,720
I am Zeng Xu.

265
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,670
I once carried out an undercover mission

266
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,530
under the alias

267
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,610
of "Ye Siyuan."

268
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,390
Today,

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm officially reinstated.

270
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,240
I'm Liu Ruyi.

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,650
Nice to meet you.

272
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,750
Nice biceps.

273
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,030
Work out with me sometime!

274
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,190
I'm Yang Zhengang.

275
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,550
Pleasure to meet you.

276
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,320
I'd appreciate your help in the future.

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,200
I may have to trouble you
to brief me about the team.

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,260
-Sure.
-Thank you.

279
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,590
Officer Bian.

280
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
How have you been?

281
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,960
What a brilliant strategy by Director Ye!

282
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,790
Wasn't it, Yang?

283
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,680
It surely was.

284
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
It was truly visionary and resourceful

285
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,440
of Director Ye to send me

286
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,119
far behind enemy lines.

287
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,589
Of course, I, a highly competent aide, was

288
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,680
also the key to success
as I bravely infiltrated the foes.

289
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,940
I was put through
hardships and torture,

290
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,390
but it doesn't matter,

291
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,319
as all that is behind me now.

292
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,839
I hope to have your help

293
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,750
and support in the future.

294
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,210
Let's work hard together!

295
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,000
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back!

296
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,790
Thank you very much.

297
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,850
I'm not sure about that torture part.

298
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,010
But you certainly chasing a good time.

299
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,270
It's just a small misunderstanding.

300
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,830
Officer Bian!

301
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,420
Officer Bian!

302
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,550
I acted like a party animal

303
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,030
only to disguise my real identity
as an undercover cop.

304
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh, right.

305
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,750
I'd like to apologize

306
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,060
for my offensive remarks

307
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,840
last time at karaoke.

308
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,940
I hope you can forgive me.

309
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,110
Really?

310
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,550
You looked like a real thug.

311
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,550
That didn't seem like acting at all.

312
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,160
Wait.

313
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
I really wasn't acting...

314
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,740
No, no, I was indeed acting back then!

315
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,420
Something on your mind?

316
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Stop laughing.

317
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,920
Just say it out loud.

318
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,130
Let me think about how to put it.

319
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,480
What is it?

320
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm planning...

321
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,370
to get married,

322
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,530
to Ziyi from Zhao Village.

323
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,880
So,

324
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,520
I'm here to ask for your opinion.

325
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,680
My opinion?

326
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,160
Why are you asking for my opinion?

327
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,270
You should talk to Ziyi first, right?

328
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,550
Before your father proposed marriage,

329
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,210
he asked for my opinion first.

330
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,880
Well, Dad asked you,

331
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,790
so I chose to ask you too.

332
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,850
I need your advice.

333
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,840
You silly boy.

334
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,030
Ziyi

335
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,110
is

336
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,680
a really nice girl.

337
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm aware of what kind of person she is.

338
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,030
She...

339
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,550
is very tolerant.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,350
But nothing matters more

341
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,010
than what the two of you think.

342
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,210
Have you both thought it through?

343
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,680
Is the affection between the two of you
at its peak right now?

344
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
If you're not sure of it,

345
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,080
then you shouldn't rush.

346
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm sure of it.

347
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,590
I'd like to start a family
before pursuing career ambitions.

348
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,680
She and I have known each other
since childhood.

349
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,210
We went to school together.

350
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,700
Anyway, I consider her...

351
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
my perfect match.

352
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,360
Well,

353
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,290
I can't offer much advice.

354
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,400
However,

355
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,690
I want you to remember one thing.

356
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,960
That is, raising your own small family

357
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,160
and managing the big community of Longwan

358
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,420
are actually the same.

359
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,720
If you are to earn respect and trust

360
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,580
from everyone,

361
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,880
then you must constantly make real efforts

362
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,700
and try convincing others.

363
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,480
When Ziyi marries you,

364
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,440
she'll become

365
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,550
part of our family.

366
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,690
But even so,

367
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,110
her care for you is not

368
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,640
something to take granted for.

369
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,350
You must earn that

370
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,400
by caring for her too.

371
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
Do you get it, son?

372
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,860
Son,

373
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,090
life is long.

374
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,830
Make sure you try your best
to build a life with her.

375
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't slack off.

376
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,310
I'll keep that in mind.

377
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,640

Give these to my wife.

566
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,350
Come on!

567
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,790
This is for my dear nephew.

568
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,480
It's from your uncle.

569
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,200
-You give it to him right here?
-A red packet for you.

570
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
I was going to give mine to Tianye's wife,
but you've all given yours to the baby.

571

572

Hello, Feng.

578
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,010

579

582
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
Such a big announcement.

584

This great reporter here, Mr. Xu,

589
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,830
Is everyone here?

590
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,160
-Yes.
-It's all set. The ceremony can start now.

591
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,490
It's your time to shine.

592
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,180

593

594

-Grab one.
-I have an idea.

595
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
-What?
-I'd like to add one more option for him.

596
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,590
What option?

597
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,920
-What is that?
-What is that?

598
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,120
Just one more option.

599
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,680
Just leave it there. It's fun!

600
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,760
-Let me put it back.
-What is it for?

601
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,800
What's that?

602
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,680
What's good about being a police officer?

603
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
You're never home.

604

Did you bring
your journalist's credential?

605
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,150
Yes.

606
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,150
Who's going to grab that?

607
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,930
Drop that idea.

608
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,240
-I'm sure he won't grab that stuff.
-Journalism is a decent profession.

609
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Come on, Baoying.

610
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,800
Baoying, come on.

611
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,680
Let me add one too.

612
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,310
What's that? Take it back!

613
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,500
Just for more fun.

614
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,550
Baoying.

615
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,760
He's getting started.

616
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,510
Grab the journalist's credential.

617
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,710
Go for the gold ingot.

618
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,220
Look at the gold ingot.

619
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,830
Grab one!

620
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,240
He grabbed the police car!

621
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,570
What an good little boy.

622
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,920
How very nice.

623
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,620
You're not drunk, are you?

624
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,620
No, I'm not.

625
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
You can really hold your liquor.

626
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,410
Shall I ask?

627
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,400
Okay.

628

How long have you known Yan?

629
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,350
Since high school.
We went to high school together.

630
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,350
That early?

631
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,830
Yes.

632
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,780
When did you two start dating?

633
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,810
A-About six months ago.

634
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,200
Six months already.

635
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,690
How many girlfriends
did you have before her?

636
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,110
Two.

637
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,680
Why did you break up with them?

638
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,000
One

639
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
went abroad.

640
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,230
The other one...

641
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,770
fought with me a lot.

642
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,270
So you didn't do anything wrong, right?

643
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
You were not responsible for the breakups?

644
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,480
Well,

645
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,110
not exactly.

646
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,910
I-I'm sure I was partly to blame.

647
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,220
What did your ex-girlfriends

648
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,600
mostly fight you about?

649
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,250
They thought...

650
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,200
that I...

651
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,860
couldn't make much money,

652
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,680
and...

653
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,400
that I was never home
due to my job as a journalist.

654
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,240
I could rarely

655
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,750
spend time with them.

656
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,080
What do you think of Yan?

657
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,360

658
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,370
She's great. Perfect, I'd say.

659

What's so great about her?

660
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,790
Everything.

661

662
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,560

663
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,160

-Generous...
-Stop throwing adjectives at us.

What are your plans for the future?

668

My plans...

669
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,210
are surely to

670
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,090
keep dating her.

671
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,000
No, no, no.

672
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,000
That's not a proper way to put it.

673
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,550
I mean,

674
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,480
I hope to take our relationship
to the next level soon.

675
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,410
Right? I will...

676
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,880
try building a stable home for Yan.

677
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,680
See,

678
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,790
this young fellow genuinely loves Yan.

679
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes.

680
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,720
The purpose of this talk
is to let you know

681
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,310
that Yan has us two brothers,

682
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,270
and that if you don't treat her right,

683
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,460
we'll hunt you down.

684

T-That won't happen.

That said, Yan also

686
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,040
has her flaws

687
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,130
and shortcomings.

688
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,950
Sometimes when she gets hot-tempered,

689
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
she might be a bit mean to you.

690
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,200
Just be tolerant

691
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
and process it yourself.

692
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,070
We just hope

693
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,400
to never hear

694
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,750
that she's upset.

695
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,550
What are you guys doing?

696
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,720
I've been looking for you.

were just chatting with me.

701
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,640
You bullied him again, didn't you?

702
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,570
No, they didn't.

703
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,650
And you, silly,

you can barely hold your liquor.

705
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,350
Why didn't you say no
when they made you drink?

706
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,090
Who made him drink? Did you?

707
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,510
I drank at my own will.

708
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Drink less if you can't hold your liquor.

709
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,230
Look how worried my sister is.

710
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,890
Sure, Feng.

711
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
You reek of alcohol.

712
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,410
Get up. Have some tea to sober up.

713
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,390
You weasels. Why mess with my boyfriend?

714
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,310
Gosh. You're really something.

715

I'll call the police!

751
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,950
What the heck?

752
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,980
What's wrong with you?

753
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,180
Are you crazy or what?

754
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,630
How could you assault people?

755
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,800
Look what you've done to my place!

756
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,280
Let go of me.

757
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,150
What are you trying to do?

758
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,030
Let go of me!

759
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Listen up,

760
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,410
my name is Guo Yaoyang.

761
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,320
From now on,

762
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,510
[Seafood Barbecue]

763
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,960
when you do business here,

764
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,090
remember to behave!

765
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,940
Are you okay, sir?

766
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,700
Unacceptable.

767
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,110
I must call the police.

768
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,110
Let it slide, sir.

769
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,670
Mr. Guo works for He Gang.

770
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
Just drop the matter.

771
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,070
Come on.

772
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,110
Get up.

773
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,760
If anyone dares to disrespect you,

774
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,320
just declare
that you're Guo Yaoyang's girlfriend.

775
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,960
Got it.

776
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,020
Then I'll beat that person up for you.

777
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,070
I need to use the bathroom. Wait for me.

778
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,630
Sure.

779
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,710
You two coming with me?

780
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes.

781
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,040
Let's see who can pee the farthest.

782
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,200
I bet you two are going to lose.

783
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,440
Dude, what do you mean by this?

784
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,230
Tell me.

785
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
What's your name?

786
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,170
Guo Yaoyang.

787
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,080
What's up?

788
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,640
You're quite famous.

789
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,530
Please, sir.

790
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,710
I have a question.

791
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Yes, sir?

792
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
Are those gambling dens there

793
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,190
all yours?

794
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,520
Gambling dens?

795
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,200
I don't know, sir. I'm not a local here.

796
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,670
Sir,

797
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,030
I recall it now.

798
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,920
I recall it.

799
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,350
They're mine.

800
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,810
Are you running them alone?

801
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,190
Yes, all by myself.

802
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,630
Sir...

803
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm not finished yet.

804
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,020
They belong to He Gang.

805
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,530
I'm just watching them for him.

806
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,200
The dens belong to him only?

807
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,000
No.

808
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,970
They belong to his brother He Biao too,

809
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,190
who owns the Grand Paradise.

810
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,030
Sir, sir, sir,

811
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,000
this is all I know.

812
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,510
I...

813
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,340
I've told you everything.

814
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,690
Do you know who Ma Jin is?

815
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,550
Mr. Ma?

816
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,750
Those gambling dens used to be Mr. Ma's,

817
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,880
but then somehow they fell

818
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
into the hands of He Biao and He Gang.

819
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,320
This is really all I know, sir.

820
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,590
I-I'm just

821
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,670
a nobody.

822
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,670
Sir, calm down.

823
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,110
Have a cigarette.

824
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,860
Stop being mad.

825
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,840
I'll ask around for you.

826
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,190
Is that okay, sir?

827
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,920
H-How should I call you, sir?

828
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,850
What do you mean?

829
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,580
You're asking my name, right?

830
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
I'll just ask around for you.

831
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,280
I mean nothing else.

832
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,760
What's going on with these two?

833
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,630
I hit them each once,
and now they're like this?

834
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,960
Both of you, get up! Hurry!

835
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,280
Nothing serious.
I'm bleeding but still fine.

836
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,840
Get up!

837
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,710
Can you walk?

838
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,310
Yes, I can.

839
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,880
Are you sure?

840
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,010
I'm perfectly fine.

841
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,880
Good.

842
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,150
I'll come to you if I need anything.

843
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,880
Sure, sir.

844
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,630
Take care, sir!

845
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,220
Here, Hongbao.

846
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,040
Oh, Mr. Bao!

847
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,760
Mr. Bao!

848
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
What happened to you?

849
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,500
Si, tidy up the place.

850
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,080
Give me some tissues.

851
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,630
Mr. Bao,

852
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,760
it's me, Jiu.

853
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,140
Si is back!

854
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,400
Look.

855
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,880
Look who's back.

856
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,130
[Mr. Bao, Su Hongbao's Boss]

857
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,790
You've recognized him.

858
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,720
You really have.

859
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,190
Wasn't it just a fall?

860
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,760
How did he

861
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,960
end up like this?

862
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,630
It was all because of Ma Jin.

863
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,440
Mr. Bao had a cerebral hemorrhage

864
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,630
and nearly died.

865
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,150
Our brothers all chipped in to help him.

866
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,600
That was how he survived.

867
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,090
We're still in debt now.

868
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,760
Mr. Bao, I'm back.

869
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,320
Don't worry.

870
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I will get back

871
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,760
what should be ours.

872
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,550
Then I'll get you proper treatment.

873
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,420
Hongbao,

874
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,070
[Wu Si, A Henchman of Su Hongbao's]

875
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,570
I waited so long for you to say that.

876
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,150
After suffering for so many years,

877
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,760
I can't take it anymore.

878
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,360
We must make a big move
before we get too old for it.

879
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,280
Jiu!

880
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,630
Close that restaurant of yours.

881
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,710
Let's all work together.

882
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,320
Si,

883
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,330
things are difficult for me.

884
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,030
Hongbao,

885
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,670
truth to be told,

886
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,510
I'm in poor health now.

887
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,360
I just want to keep running my restaurant,

888
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,480
make a living,

889
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,280
and live a stable life.

890
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,210
It's okay.

891
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,110
People pursue different things.

892
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,760
Go buy Mr. Bao

893
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,870
some fruit then.

894
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,880
Hongbao, there's money on me.

895
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,140
I'll go buy some fruit.

896
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,030
What a coward.

897
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,840
Jiu was cowardly before,
and now he's even more so.

898
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,370
Hongbao,

899
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,080
the two of us can make a proper team
without him.

900
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,510
Mr. Bao, easy, easy.

901
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,840
This is Hongbao.

902
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,590
Si.

903
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,680
Look into

904
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,590
He Biao and He Gang.

905
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,840
Figure out their backgrounds.

906
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,640
I think someone's backing them.

907
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,510
By the way,

908
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,880
Lin didn't die.

909
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Lin didn't die.

910
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,200
Think of something.

911
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,630
Try...

912
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,880
if you can get his contact.

913
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,360
Qin,

914
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,420
something came up.

915
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,550
Okay. What is it?

916
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,400
Didn't you ask me to keep

917
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
close watch on Lin's home,

918
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,200
who worked for Ma Jin?

919
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,280
All was quiet until a few days ago,

920
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,000
someone came find him.

921
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:08,840
Who was it?

922
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,000
A man named Su Hongbao. I looked into him.

923
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,260
He's an ex-con who just got out of prison.

924
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,960
Do you need me to dig deeper?

925
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,110
I know this guy.

926
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
You know him?

927
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,550
It was I who arrested him.

928
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,920
It's okay.

929
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,130
Leave this to me.

930
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,820
He's not your problem now.

931
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,240
Alright.

932
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,660
[In loving memory
of my beloved daughter Qian Yuhong]

933
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,880
Yuhong,

934
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,480
how time flies.

935
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,710
In the blink of an eye,

936
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,400
we've been apart for 2 years.

937
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,210
In dreams I forget I'm just a visitor,

938
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,130
yet waking feels like I'm still dreaming.

939
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,000
[In loving memory
of my beloved daughter Qian Yuhong]

940
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, right, Muzhi,

941
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,500
someone's secretly running gambling dens
behind our backs.

942
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,300
Shouldn't we teach him a lesson?

943
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,510
Don't all the gambling dens in Hanzhou

944
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,960
belong to the He family?

945
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,310
Secretly running gambling dens
behind our backs?

946
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,710
Is it because I, He Muzhi, have been

947
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,640
appearing too refined in public lately?

948
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,640
Yeah.

949
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,420
But it's a bit tricky

950
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,240
to deal with this person.

951
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,600
It's Liu Tianfei.

952
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,570
Muzhi,

953
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,270
your tactics to manage people
aren't working well.

954
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,640
They all seem defiant.

955
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,320
Liu Tianfei...
