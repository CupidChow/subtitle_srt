00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,610
The gold bars are all in the vault.

193
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,790
But...

194
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,510
why do I feel Liu Tianye's got bad luck
written all over his face?

195
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,120
He's going to die sooner or later.

196
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,380
I think he can survive.

197
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,250
It doesn't matter even if he dies.

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,740
The gold bars are ours anyway.

199
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,550
Two things.

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,680
First, bring Song Hao back to me.

201
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,320
Second, find out where the money is now.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
It definitely wasn't Song Hao.

203
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,270
He doesn't have the guts.

204
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,070
Okay, Mr. Luo.

205
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,410
I can't believe all this.

206
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,310
Hello.

207
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,200
Is this Song Hao?

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,050
This is Gaoxin Police Station.

209
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,840
You reported
at Guanlan Residence this month

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,640
that you lost something, right?

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,620
We have some leads now.

212
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,370
You've found it?

213
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,030
Who took it?

214
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,920
We can't disclose that yet.

215
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
But this matter has now been taken over

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,300
by the first criminal investigation squad
of the Municipal Bureau.

217
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,210
It's under the charge of Officer Qin Feng.

218
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,140
Why don't you...

219
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,750
call him?

220
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
The first criminal investigation squad?

221
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,150
Why them?

222
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,880
I'm not sure.

223
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,010
But we'll definitely notify you
if there's any news.

Please keep your phone on.

226
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,600
This guy must be confused
after hearing that.

227
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,870
The trap is already set.

228
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,180
Now let's just see who'll take the bait.

See if he has any other residences.

232
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,640
Got it.

233
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,260
It's extremely urgent.
I can't explain clearly over the phone.

234
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,460
We must meet.

236
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,480

Okay.

Song Hao is on the move.

241
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,550
Got it.

242
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,490
I'll follow him.

243
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,440
Sir.

244
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm here. Where are you?

245
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,200
What's the matter?

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,860
Spit it out.

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,300
Qian Yuhong is dead.

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,640
Qin Feng is after me.

249
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,200
You need to help me

250
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,150
quickly get the money and gold bars back.

251
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,150
Otherwise, neither Ma Jin nor Qin Feng
will let me off.

252
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,430
What does this have to do with me?

253
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,870
Sir,

254
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,040
don't you think it's not appropriate
for you to say that right now?

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,860
Don't forget

256
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,570

257
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,530
and property overseas.

258
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,300
Are you threatening me?

259
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,140
Do you believe

260
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,920
I can arrest you right now?

261
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,260
How would I dare threaten you?

262
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,660
But think about it.

263
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,290
If you protect me,

264
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,770
I can continue to make money for you.

265
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
But if I go down,

266
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,000
all your efforts over the years
will be for nothing.

267
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,670
That said,

268
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:00,930

269
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,530
I say something wrong

270
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,960
and implicate you,

271
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,210
that wouldn't be good, right?

272
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
Don't go home.

273
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,770
Find a place to hide.

If there's any news,

275
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,470
I'll let you know.

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,100

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,050

After you followed him to the mall today,

324
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,100
did you find anything?

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,200
What's wrong?

326
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
You can't tell me?

327
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,990
Nothing.

328
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,410
I didn't see anything.

329
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,850
Crazy,

330
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,110
there's a traitor in the bureau,

331
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,030
so you're hiding what you've found

332
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,200
even from me, huh?

333
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,110
Right now it's all speculation.
There's no direct evidence.

334
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,770
Are you going to tell me or not?

335
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,820
Help me analyze it.

336
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,040
Alright, I'll analyze it.

337
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,800
But this whole thing is just speculation.

338
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,710
Let's not jump to conclusions.

339
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,480
Tell me. Tell me first.

340
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,310
I followed Song Hao today

341
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,920
because we had intel
that he'd meet someone, right?

342
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,440
Yes.

343
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,510
But

344
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,690
he didn't meet anyone.

345
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,010
He made a phone call instead.

346
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,780
And then?

347
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,450
After the call,

348
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,370
Song Hao left first.

349
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I followed him...

350
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,310
and ran into Ji.

351
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,600
That's perfectly normal.

352
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,070
Well,

353
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,550
Ji appearing at the mall is...

354
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,180
is nothing strange.

355
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,160
Yes.

356
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,890
That's right.

357
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,510
Last time, when we

358
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,140
followed Luo Bo

359
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,760
to that restaurant,

360
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,580
we saw Captain Zhong
coming out from there.

361
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,450
But that restaurant

362
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,350
is a place Ji frequents.

363
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,730
That's pretty normal too.

364
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,330
Well...

365
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,830
Hanzhou only has a few good restaurants.

366
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,890
Him making a reservation there is...

367
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,610
i-is nothing unusual.

368
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,760
There's something else.

369
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
Song Hao...

370
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,870
asked Qian Yuhong to buy a bracelet

371
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,810
to give as a gift.

372
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,140
It's worn on Ji's wrist.

373
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,100
This matter about Qian Yuhong—

374
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,020
why didn't you tell me before?

375
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,120
It's just speculation.

376
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,440
Wait. Then...

377
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,880
Then...

378
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
why would Ji do something like that?

379
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,240
Back when he was at the station,

380
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,340
he always thought for everyone.

381
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,830
When newcomers arrived,

382
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,960
he helped them get familiar with the work.

383
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,270
He always took on the hardships first

384
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,790
and shared the credit with everyone.

385
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,200
Why...

386
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,610
Why would he do that?

387
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,070
Look, right now we're just speculating.

388
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,070
There's no direct evidence, right?

389
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,480
Didn't I just tell you

390
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,010
not to jump to conclusions?

391
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Crazy,

392
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,430
we're both police officers.

393
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,830
When there are too many coincidences,

394
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,470
they're definitely
not coincidences anymore.

Look at you.

397
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I told you, and now you're like this.

398
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,750
I asked you to help me analyze it.

399
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,830
I didn't say it's him.

401
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,020

No, I...

Don't you get it?

Mrs. Ji made dumplings,

415
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
but you only thought about his mom.

416

Indeed, it's nothing serious.

507
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,800
It's just that during the process,
there was a small...

508

a small oversight.

about what exactly Song Hao did.

526
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,280
So...

527
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,060
I can't make you any promises.

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,720
Won't you take care of his matter either?

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
You two are as close as father and son.

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,610
What did you do?

532
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:15,940
What...

533
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,110
What... What...

534
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,260
What did I do?

535
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,700
In Song Hao's business,

536
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,760
he is also involved.

Uncle,

543
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,000
it was like this.

544
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,480
I... I heard from Aunt

545
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,270
that you

546
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,400
wanted a house for retirement.

547
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,290
Song Hao happened to have connections.

548
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:46,810
Right?

549
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,960
So I asked Song Hao...

550
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,100
to handle it for you.

551
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

552
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,220
He was accused of rape.

553
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,110
You don't know about that either?

00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,830

556
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,440
I... I was drunk

557
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,240
that day.

558
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,530
I really was drunk.

559
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,330
I... I don't remember anything.

560
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,180
I don't think

561
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,390
I... I did anything.

562
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,280
Song Hao asked Ma

563
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,960
to settle the matter.

564
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
Otherwise,

565
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,100
he would've been in jail already.

566
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,160
Junior,

567
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000

Siyuan can't get away either.

570

He'll rat him out.

571
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,550
By that time,

572
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,300

573
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,000

574
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,070
you and your nephew, Siyuan—

575
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,590
we'll put on quite a spectacular show

576
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,360
for the people of Hanzhou.

577
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,690
The four of us

578
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,310
are all indispensable.

579
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,510
Wang.

580

583
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,210
I... I'll go get the car.

584
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,110
What a coincidence, Director Ye.

585
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,380
Mr. Ma,

586
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,330
this meal was your idea, right?

587

We've been friends for so many years.

588
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,490
Why won't you give me any face?

589
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,460
It's not that I won't give you face.

590
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,790
I'll be honest with you.

591
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,420
I came back to Hanzhou this time

592
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,950
specifically to investigate you.

593
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,190
No one can stop me.

594

After you.

595
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,200
It seems we're not going the same way.

596
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
You first.

597
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,400
This Song Hao, Song Hao.

598

Mr. Wang.

599
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,690
Actually,

600
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,830
I understand you completely.

601
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,920
Look.

602
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,640
When I first met Yi,

603
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
I think she was only about this tall.

604
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,690
In the blink of an eye,
over 30 years have passed.

605
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,750
Now she's a mother.

606
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,640
So...

607
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,450
a wife can't be without a husband.

608
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,100
A child can't be without a father.

609
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,280
Think of another way.

610
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,200
There's no other way.

611
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,980
If Song Hao lives,

612
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,280
neither of us will have peace.

613
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,960
Make him shut up.

614
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,800
Make him mute.

615
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Or...

616
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,750
make him leave this place

617
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,050
and never come back.

618
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,110
My old leader,

619
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,960
you're thinking too simply.

620
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,000
Where can he go?

621
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,920
How can we make him shut up?

622
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,300
What can I do?

623
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,680
My only solution

624
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,520
is to send him on a path of no return.

625
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
Mr. Wang,

626
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,880
if you are wise,

627
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,440

00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,730
No one has seen his face.

758
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,330
We must get Song Hao's computer back.

759
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,480
It definitely contains

760
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,540
evidence about you and Bole Finance.

761
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,560
If we can't get it back, kid,

762
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,660
no one will be able to protect you.

763
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,070
I heard from the hospital
there's a matching kidney source today.

764
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,920
Seems we need
to make good use of this friend.

765
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,030
I'll go take care of it now.

766
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,710
Wait.

767
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,710
At the pawnshop,

768
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,060
this was found.

769
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,710
Isn't this what we left
at Guanlan Residence?

770
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,510
Can you guess who pawned it?

771
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,110
Who?

772
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,590
Liu Tianfei.

773
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,170
When it comes down to it,

774
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,310
they're all on the same side.

775
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,230
Deal with them one by one.

776
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,630
Kid.

777
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,550
Keep your eyes wide open.

778
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,920
Those from Longwan

779
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,720
are better at playing tricks than you.

780
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,010
-Crazy!
-Why are you running?

781
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,190
I need to request leave.

782
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,920
The hospital called,

783
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,360
saying they have found
a matching kidney source

784
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
and can operate on my mom right away.

785
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,710
I... I'll give you a ride.

786
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,150
Okay.

787
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
That's so sudden.

788
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,980
[Hanzhou Central Hospital]

789
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,700
[Quiet]

790
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,650
Mom.

791
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,380
Where did she go?

792
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,060
I don't know either.

793
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,170
Did she go to the bathroom?

794
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,170
Excuse me.

795
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,030
Where did the patient in Bed 6 go?

796
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,980
Bed 6?

797
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,310
She was just here.

798
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,220
Maybe she went to prepare for surgery?

799
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,370
[Ward 7]

800
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,160
Impossible. I haven't signed the consent.
How could she have surgery?

801
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,620
Then I don't know.

802
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,440
I'll go ask the attending physician.

803
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,570
Okay, I'll check at the nurse station.

804
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,380
Officer Wang.

805
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,620
Dr. Ji.

806
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
Do you know where my mom is?

807
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,470
Shouldn't she be waiting for surgery?

808
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,670
She's not in her ward.

809
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,320
That's strange.

810
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,230
We just told her

811
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,290
to wait in her ward.

812
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,230
Alright, I got it.

813
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,030
Officer Wang!

814
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,690
Transplant surgery can't be delayed.

815
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,350
We can wait 40 minutes at most.

816
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,920
It's not easy
to come across a matching kidney source.

817
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,670
And your colleague's tissue typing
wasn't a match.

818
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,360
Hurry up.

819
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,070
My colleague?

820
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,630
Who?

00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,450
Find your mom quickly.

00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,880
Don't miss the chance.

824
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,070
Tao.

825
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,940
I haven't seen her anywhere.

826
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,290
Any luck over here?

827
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,780
The doctor said he hasn't seen her either.

828
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,560
Well, Crazy.

829
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,530
Something doesn't feel right.
