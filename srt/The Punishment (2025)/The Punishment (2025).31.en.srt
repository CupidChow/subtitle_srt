Still unconscious.

This brand isn't cheap.

It probably doesn't belong to the injured.

18
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,150
It was most likely left behind
by the person

19
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,480
who kidnapped Fang Lei.

Did Fang Lei say anything?

34
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,750
He said that on the day Liu Yi died,

35
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,840
he did see someone drive up.

However,

190
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,150
Come on.

191
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,320
I don't know Liu Yi.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
But

193
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,380
I know Hu Yi and Tianyi.

194
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,480
If you let me go,

195
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,410
I'll help you contact them

196
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,880
and see if they know him.

197
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Okay?

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,870
Besides, what does Liu Yi's life and death

199
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,120
have to do with me?

200
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,150
If you still don't release me,

201
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,610
I'll sue him for violent law enforcement
and wrongful arrest.

202

206

217
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,010
Surfing the internet.

218
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,270
How long were you there?

219
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,000
All night.

220
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,750
Did you leave in the middle?

221
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,210
I was there the whole time.

222
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,320
So you know which day Liu Yi died, right?

223
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,390
No.

224
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,920
I bought a monthly package.

225
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,870
You lived at the internet café?

That's right.

or took a shower?

the whole time.

We never collude.

248
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,660
Did I make you hit someone?

249
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,770
Did you do it yourself?

250
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,390
Or

I... I don't understand.

You don't need to understand.

254
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,270
Hurry up and take him away.

255
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,030
Just looking at him is annoying.

256

looks a lot like He Gang's wound.

Right?

279
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,710

was using Zheng Gao to set us up.

what they were really up to,

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,960
This aroma...

377
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
is so pure.

378
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,750
If you like it, I'll have someone

379
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
bring more

380
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,480
and put them in your trunk later.

381
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Here's the thing.

382
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,700
Ba and Chen

383
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,290
are old-timers of ours.

384
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,500
They are reliable.

385
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,980
Uncle Tianye's idea is

386
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,400
to use their identities
to apply for gun licenses,

387
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,350
registered
under the security transport company.

388
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,480
They might come in handy in the future.

389
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,780
This cigarette of yours

390
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,410
carries quite some weight.

391
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm afraid it's too much for me to enjoy.

392
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,250
Whether you can enjoy it or not

393
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,290
is entirely up to you. Right, Mr. Song?

394
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,110
By the way,

395
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,590
Uncle Tianye said

396
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,310
once this is done,

397
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,050
he will

398
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,710
see to your son's promotion.

399
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,550
Then...

400
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,170
I'll give it a try.

401
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,200
Mr. Liu is grooming you as his successor.

402
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,740
We do exactly

403
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,490
what Uncle Tianye instructs.

404
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,440
Good.

405
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,730
I look forward

406
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,650
to our long-term collaboration.

407
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,880
Try it.

408
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Dad.

409
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,100
Wait.

410
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,400
Excuse me for a moment.

411
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,060
Okay. Okay.

412
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,440
Why are you here?

413
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
What are you doing here?

414
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,590
Can't I come take a look?

415
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,830
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

416
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,510
I'm busy here.
Why are you causing trouble?

417
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,510
Go home right now!

418
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,640
What took you so long?

419
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,160
Uncle.

420
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,800
What's up?

421
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,940
He snuck out by himself.

422
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,470
I told him to study at home.

423
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,240
Forget studying. He's already here.

424
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,850
Let him see the world. Come on.

425
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,080
What world does a kid need to see?

426
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,060
Zhang.

427
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,240
Here. Let me introduce someone to you.

428
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,790
This is Editor-in-Chief Zhang,
the most knowledgeable in all of Hanzhou.

429
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,180
This is my nephew, Zhao Wenxuan.

430
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,070
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

431
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,110
Nice to meet you.

432
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,130
He's about to graduate.

433
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,680
You know some people
at the Education Bureau, right?

434
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,620
Help him.

435
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,130
Get me a drink.

436
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,680
What do you want to do in the future,
young man?

437
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,440
He wants
to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

438
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,750
I want to join our company.

439
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,400
Join our company?

440
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,010
Have a drink with him first.

441
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,440
He's just a kid.

442
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,750
He can't drink. He can't drink.

443
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,110
It's fine. Having a little is fine.

444
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,640
I'll drink for him. Come on.

445
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,720
So you want to join our company, right?

446
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,030
After finishing this drink,
you're not needed here.

447
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,560
You guys carry on chatting.

448
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,350
We at Tianyun want him. Okay?

449
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,310
What's the point?

450
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,680
With his current grades,

451
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,790
he's not qualified to join Tianyun.

452
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,400
He should focus on his postgraduate exams.

453
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,270
Congratulations.

454
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,870
Thank you.

455
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,200
-Isn't it more reassuring if he joins us?
-Tianye.

456
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Jiangyan is here.

457
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,510
Don't listen to your father.

458
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,310
That's just unnecessary worry.

459
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,190
Come here.

460
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,830
Don't say too many harsh words.

461
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,440
I know.

462
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,110
Come here.

463
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,170
What are you doing?

464
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,410
Tianye.

465
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,410
What took you so long?

466
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,350
What happened?

467
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,410
Congratulations.

468
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
She was getting dressed up.

469
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
I rushed her a few times
but couldn't get her moving.

470
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,590
What's wrong with getting dressed up?
Doesn't she look good?

471
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,250
Today is my brother's big day.

472
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,820
Of course I should prepare properly.

473
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,020
We're all family. There's no need to...

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,530
prepare.

475
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,920
Come on. Let's go inside.

476
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,850
Come in, please.

477
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,070
Ziyi,

478
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
where's Baoying?

479
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,030
He's upstairs.

480
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Who told you to come here?

481
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,410
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

482
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,150
I can't just study all the time.

483
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,550
I can't depend on you forever.

484
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,480
What do you mean?

485
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,490
You think I can't support you?

486
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,550
Dad.

487
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,450
Can you tone down the dad vibes?

488
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,420
Let me tell you.

489
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
I don't care what you do in the future.

490
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,030
Civil service exam, postgraduate studies,
studying abroad—it's all fine.

491
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,030
I'll support you.

492
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,840
Even doing nothing is okay.

493
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,750
But you just can't join Tianyun.

494
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,400
Why?

495
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,160
No reason.

496
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,790
Eat first.

497
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,840
Go home after the meal.

498
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,270
Come here.

499
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,790
Wait.

500
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,270
Do you have to say it now?

501
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,920
Jiajun,

502
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,880
back then, you promised

503
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,440
that pork prices would fall.

504
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,750
Here, take a look yourself.

505
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,400
Look how much they've risen.

506
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
Keep your voice down.

507
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,110
Listen,

508
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,750
I lost money too.

509
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,920
Futures trading is always high-risk.

510
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,550
Besides,

511
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,270
you said you wanted to make money.

512
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,440
That's why I brought you into this.

513
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,500
It's not about making money anymore.

514
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,920
I'll be honest with you.

515
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The company has no money left.

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,060
You have to save me.

517
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,640
Fine, I'll figure something out later.

518
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,420
Do it now.
I'm waiting for you to save my life!

519
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,200
Tell Tianye.

520
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,220
Listen.

521
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,510
If you tell him

522
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,640
about our business deal, you're dead.

523
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,620
Keep your mouth shut.

524
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,240
If there's no other way,

525
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,440
just go back to the smuggling business.

526
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,590
Smuggling?

527
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Tianye said

528
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
we can never touch that.

529
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
Then do it secretly.

530
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,880
I'll invest some money.

531
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,750
Count me as a shareholder.

532
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,920
We'll make money together.

533
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,510
You said it yourself.

534
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,110
Jiajun.

535
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,880
Mr. Liu.

536
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,270
Mr. Wei, you're here too.

537
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,440
Wei, that's it for today.

538
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,400
I still have something to attend to.

539
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm heading over there first.

540
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,270
Let's have a drink later.

541
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,070
Okay. Okay.

542
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,640
Tianfei,

543
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,920
there were too many people earlier,
so I didn't go to you.

544
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,980
About that matter—

545
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,160
it didn't work out.

546
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,560
I know it didn't work out.

547
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,670
You saw the statement
the police issued, right?

548
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,310
Yes.

549
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,120
I didn't expect the police to be prepared.

550
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,220
Here's what you do.

551
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,400
Find more people,

552
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,110
stir this up some more,

553
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,690
and make a bigger commotion.

554
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,760
I think we should drop this.

555
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,640
If this goes on, we'll break the law.

556
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,480
What law?

557
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,790
What law?

558
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,720
Do you understand public opinion?

559
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,320
We need to muddy the waters.

560
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,110
Fine.

561
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,070
I'll introduce people to you.

562
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,240
As for the specifics,

563
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
you discuss with them yourself.

564
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,590
Okay. Okay.

565
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,310
If this works out,

566
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,090
I'll buy you drinks later.

567
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,310
Bottoms up.

568
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,460
Bottoms up.

569
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,950
Drink whatever you like.

570
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,060
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

571
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,610
Let's finish it together.

572
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,810
Have fun, everyone.

573
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,890
Everyone's here.

574
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Feng.

575
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,410
What's the meaning of this?

576
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,940
You weren't invited today.

577
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,940
Why are you here?

578
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,520
I came back to my home to have a meal.

579
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,430
Do I need to report to you?

580
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,240
Your home?

581
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,550
You're neither from Longwan

582
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,830
nor from Tianyun.

583
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,050
Listen.

584
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,720
Don't embarrass yourself.

585
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,580
You're not welcome here.

586
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,270
Leave now.

587
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,570
Tianfei,

588
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,700
when you're out there,

589
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,180
you should know your place
and show respect.

590
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,500
Have some manners.

591
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,340
You're not behaving well.

592
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,550
Tianye.

593
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,990
I came for a meal.

594
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,400
That's okay, right?

595
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,170
Anytime.

596
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,030
You can come back to eat
whenever you want.

597
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,720
Great.

598
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,160
Tianfei,

599
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,530
the guy they arrested the other day...

600
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,440
Zheng Gao—

601
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,450
he's your friend, isn't he?

602
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,440
I don't know him.

603
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,570
You don't know him?

604
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,270
He was your buddy when fighting,

605
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,260
but when he's in trouble,
you don't know him?

606
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,560
You're such a jerk.

607
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,680
Tianye,

608
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,110
you got yourself a godson?

609
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,170
Congratulations.

610
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,400
Baoshuai.

611
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,850
Come here.

612
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,560
Come here.

613
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,200
Call him Uncle Feng.

614
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,530
Uncle Feng.

615
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,110
Baoshuai.

616
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,350
Sit. Sit here.

617
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,000
Come.

618
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,320
You're getting more handsome.

619
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,690
I need to call a friend here.

620
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,440
It's me.

621
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,880
I'd like to report something.

622
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,140
At the Hanzhou Club,

623
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,510
I ran into a suspect.

624
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,350
Please come over.

625
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay.

626
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,310
Okay.

627
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,070
It's fine. You sit here.

628
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,730
Don't move.

629
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,280
Captain Qin.

630
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,860
Ding Baoshuai.

631
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm off duty today.

632
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,980
Do whatever

633
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,030
you need to do.

634
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,930
You are Ding Baoshuai, right?

635
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,530
Is this cufflink yours?

636
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,960
Yes.

637
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,240
We suspect you are involved
in a serious assault case.

638
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,160
Please come with us
to assist in the investigation.

639
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,960
Take him away.

640
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,960
What's going on?

641
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,680
Nothing.

642
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,920
What are you doing?

643
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,160
I'd like to see
who dares to take him away today.

644
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,960
What are you doing?

645
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,620
Do you want to come with us too?

646
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm sorry, officer.

647
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,280
My brother...

648
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,240
is drunk.

649
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,920
Everyone, back off.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,050
Everyone, sit down.

653
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,900
Qin Feng, what do you mean?

654
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,240
You're here to cause trouble, is that it?

655
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,640
You won't rest until you

656
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,840
break this family apart, is that right?

657
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,640
You ungrateful traitor.

658
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Tianfei,

659
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,440
I just told you

660
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,350
you should follow the rules
when you're out there.

661
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,750
Don't be disrespectful.

662
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,790
Follow the rules?

663
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,250
Tell me what the rules are.

664
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,680
Stand up! Stand up!

665
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,480
You don't know what the rules are, huh?

666
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,680

You think being a cop makes you so great?

This isn't over, Qin Feng!

678
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,760
What kind of upbringing is this?

679
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,480
If you wanted the person,

680
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,010
you could have just told me.

681
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,590
Why make it so awkward
and embarrass ourselves

682
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,790
in front of everyone?

683
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,310
Tianye,

684
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,030
it's not that I didn't want to tell you.

685
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,790
It's that telling you wouldn't help.

686
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,300
Besides, these matters

687
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,350
aren't my responsibility.

688
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,980
I was just passing by today

689
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,170
and ran into him.

690
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,680
And I was just fulfilling my duty...

691
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
as a citizen.

692
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,920
If you were just passing by,

693
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,580
you could've just come to eat.

694
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,790
You didn't have to fulfill any duty.

695
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,400
No problem.

696
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,600
The bosses are all here.

697
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,520
I rarely get to see you.

698
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,910
Then today, at Tianye's place,

699
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,240
I'm taking the chance to report to you.

700
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,110
Recently,

701
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,510
in Hanzhou,

702
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,350
too many things have happened.

703
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,480
One after another.

704
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,750
And our public security organs

705
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,200
are under great pressure.

706
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
But we are also doing our best

707
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,780
to investigate

708
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,360
and arrest suspects.

709
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,590
We will find

710
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,030
the bad guys.

711
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,380
So no one should take chances.

712
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,780
I'm talking about Ding Baoshuai.

713
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,030
How big a deal is his matter anyway?

714
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:10,960
Just a fight,

715
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,720
right?

716
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,790
But if he should be arrested, he will be.

717
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,750
No other way.

718
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
You see, with my profession,

719
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,240
I can't stand any dirt in my eyes.

720
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,730
It's never easy for a cop

721
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
to work a case involving family.

722
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,730
You can understand, right?

723
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,930
It's good that you understand.

724
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,240
Alright.

I'll head back first, Tianye.

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,310
how should we handle Baoshuai's matter?

729
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,480
About Baoshuai's matter,

730
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,010
I'll figure something out.

00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,310
although Tianyun

752
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,790
only invested some money

753
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,920
in the port project,

754
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,020
Tianye and Zhang Xin
worked very closely together.

755
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,590
Don't worry about these things.

756
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,810
Where's Baobao?

757
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,790
At home with Mom.

758
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,930
That's good.

759
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,070
When you have time,
take Baoying back more often to play.

760
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,330
The old lady surely misses her grandson.

761
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,430
Are you okay?

762
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,270
I'm fine.

763
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,510
Alright.

764
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,310
I need to hurry back to the bureau.

765
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,310
You two head back.

766
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,970
I'm leaving.

767
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Quick, say goodbye to Uncle Feng.

768
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
Bye bye, Uncle Feng.

769
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,640
Okay.

770
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,520
-Come home more often when you're free.
-Okay.

771
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
I renovated this room recently.

772
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,160
It has constant temperature and humidity.

773
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,680
You won't feel cold even shirtless.

774
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,740
Most importantly,

775
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,690
the soundproofing is excellent.

776
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,640
That's thoughtful.

777
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,590
Come on.

778
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,680
This wine is good.
I should get a few bottles.

779
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,810
I've already put 2 cases in your trunk.

780
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,880
I came today

781
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,540
mainly to tell you something.

782
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,240
The boss asked me to pass on a message.

783
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,110
This time,

784
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,510
you did a good job.

785
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,960
Keep up the good work.

786
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,590
He said

787
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,420
in the future, Tianyun

788
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
can also become like Xinrui.

789
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,200
We...
We wouldn't dare compare with Xinrui.

790
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
We'd be content just to get a share.

791
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,180
And you,

792
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
don't be too restrained.

793
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,160
The boss likes low-key,

794
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,240
obedient, and capable people like you.

795
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,270
Keep up the good work.

796
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,000
Got it.

797
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,590
Please help me deliver my gratitude

798
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,500
to the boss.

799
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,240
I have some matters
to attend to downstairs.

800
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,640
Why don't you rest for a while?

801
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,500
Okay, go ahead.

802
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,960
Tianye.

803
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,720
I've taken care

804
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,600
of everything outside.

805
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,260
As for Baoshuai's matter,

806
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,400
how do you plan to handle it?

807
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I found a fall guy.

808
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,980
I also talked to Director Peng.

809
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,640
We'll get him released first.

810
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,160
Tianye,

811
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,330
what Feng did today

812
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,670
is a declaration of war against us.

813
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,520
Regarding the port accident,

814
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,750
he's somewhat suspicious.

815
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,480
But there's no solid evidence.

816
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,920
But Liu Yi's body
has nothing to do with us.

817
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,800
Don't worry.

818
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,360
Alright.

819
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Think carefully.

820
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,760
Think clearly before you speak.

821
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,070
Right now,
it's not about me thinking clearly.

822
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,720
It's about you listening carefully.

823
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,830
I've told you many times.

824
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,000
I was drunk those days.

825
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I lost the cufflink a long time ago.

826
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,270
Where I lost it, who picked it up—

827
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,220
I have no idea.

828
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,200
Ding Xiaoshuai,

829
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,930
don't try to weasel out of this.

830
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Which days exactly?

831
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,930
Where did you drink? With whom?

832
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,240
My name is Ding Baoshuai.

833
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,500
Answer the questions!

834
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,590
I really can't remember clearly.

835
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,310
How about this?

836
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,270
You investigate thoroughly

837
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,130
and help me recall what happened.

840
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,350
Tell me, how did Ding Xiaoshuai

841
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,500
become like this?

842
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,460
The port incident

843
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
and Liu Yi's case—

844
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,190
are they behind them?

845
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,070
You,

846
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,090
don't overthink it.

Don't overthink it.

What show are they putting on?

850
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,150
Absolutely brilliant.

851
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,710
Someone just turned himself in.

852
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,440
He said Fang Lei owed him money.

853
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,630
When they went to collect the debt
from Fang Lei,

854
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,429
they injured Fang Lei's driver.

855
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
They even have an IOU.

856
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,860
And that cufflink.

857
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,760
They said

858
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,219
they stole it
when Ding Xiaoshuai was drunk.

859
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
They found a fall guy.

860
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,150
So blatant now?

863
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,330
did capture

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
that person and Ding Xiaoshuai

865
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
showing up at the same time

866
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,710
a few days before the incident.

867
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,280
They were drinking the whole time.

868
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,940
They even have witnesses too.

Most importantly,

870
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,330
the victim's family came too,

871
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,990
confirming Fang Lei indeed owed money.

872
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,050
The superiors are discussing it now.

873
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,900
Ding Xiaoshuai might have to be released.

874
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,300
What should we do, Mentor?

875
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,600
Clock out.

876
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,370
Go home and rest.

was all over the news.

Now Ding Baoshuai's matter has turned out

880
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,650
to be a misunderstanding.

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,500
Tell me,

882
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,800
how much pressure from the higher-ups

883
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,670
have I been shielding you from?

884
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,510
Regarding Zheng Gao's matter before,

885
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,840
I was also responsible.

886
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,610
But Director Peng,

887
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,610
don't you find it strange?

888
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I suggest we thoroughly investigate

889
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,550
that person who turned himself in.

890
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,030
Why did he suddenly confess?

891
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,070
He even came
with a complete evidence chain.

892
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,000
We don't even need to investigate.

893
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,590
In all my years as a detective,

894
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,510
this is the first time
I've seen something like this.

895
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,570
Investigate then.

896
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,940
Of course we can investigate.

897
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,320
But...

898
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,960
can we

899
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,360
release Ding Baoshuai first?

900
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,590
At least for now,

901
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,330
he's not the prime suspect.

902
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,530
Besides,

903
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,840
you've questioned

904
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,510
and interrogated him for so long,

905
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,230
but you
haven't gotten anything substantial.

906
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,230
We can't keep holding him like this.

907
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,080
Here, come on.

908
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,050
Sit and talk.

909
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,230
I know

910
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,890
the responsibility

911
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,550
doesn't lie entirely with you.

912
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,680
It's mainly because

913
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,130
your subordinates

914
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,000
weren't careful enough

915
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,550
and were too impulsive.

916
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,480
When you go back,

917
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,860
tighten up

918
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,880
the team management properly.

919
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,230
Discipline them when needed.

920
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,760
Scold them when necessary.

921
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,510
Jade must be carved to become a vessel.

922
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,440
Especially someone like Qin Feng—

923
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,880
he has great potential,

924
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,170
but without proper guidance,

925
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,550
he'll grow wild

926
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,940
and never become successful.

927
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,310
Besides, Zhong,

928
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,430
I've told you before,

929
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,090
I just took this position.

930
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,910
I haven't even gotten comfortable
in the chair.

931
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,910
Don't let any more mistakes happen.

932
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,760
Moreover,

933
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,230
this is also a critical time for you.

934
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,940
It's not that I don't want to help you.

935
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,600
I just can't make it happen.

936
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,370
Do you understand what I mean?

937
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,560
I understand.

938
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,470
Thank you for the reminder, Director Peng.

939
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,840
Wait, do you really understand
or are you just saying that?

940
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
I really understand.

941
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,960
Well then, tell me,

942
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,710
what's your next step?

943
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,660
Release Ding Baoshuai.

944
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,400
This page

945
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,230
will be considered turned.

946
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,960
From now on,

947
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
I will definitely

948
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,170
keep a close eye on every case.

949
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,510
If anyone...

950
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,850
makes a mistake again, I'll punish them.

951
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,960
Punish them strictly.

952
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,490
I think that's acceptable.

953
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,630
Let's do it.

954
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,760
Alright.

955
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,270
That's all for today.

956
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,170
Then I'll head back first.

957
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Alright, I'm fine now. Don't worry.

958
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,520
I'm sorry.

959
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,460
I lost the cufflink you gave me.

960
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,630
It's okay.

961
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
I'll buy you a new one.

962
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,680
Let's go home first.

963
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,030
Let me take you home first.

964
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,490
I need to see Uncle Tianye.

965
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,750
[Hanzhou Club]

966
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,550
[Shuai]

967
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,430
Uncle Tianye,

968
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,070
I'm back.

969
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,740
Did you suffer?

970
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,840
I'm fine.

971
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,070
It's just that...

972
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,630
I'm sorry about the cufflink.

973
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,690
I was too careless.

974
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,190
There's no need to apologize.

975
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,520
Everyone makes mistakes.

976
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,780
Don't take it to heart.

977
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,190
In a while,

978
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,590
there won't be Xinrui in Hanzhou.

979
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,110
Everything will belong to our Tianyun.

980
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,310
By then, you'll have a lot more to learn.

981
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,260
Leave tasks for others to others.

982
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,160
No need to handle everything yourself.

983
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,050
Understood.

984
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,190
Tianye.

985
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
There's something

986
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,820
I need to tell you.

987
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,350
Go ahead.

988
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,090
Didn't you tell us before

989
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,590
not to engage in smuggling?

990
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,810
But recently I discovered

991
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,410
Mr. Wei is secretly doing it.

992
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
What happened to him?

993
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,150
It seems

994
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,230
he made some investment

995
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,280
and lost money.
So he urgently needs money.

996
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,760
Also,

997
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,710
the one working with Mr. Wei

998
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,280
is your brother-in-law,

999
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,100
Mr. Xu.

1000
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,320
How did those two end up together?

1001
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,190
Mr. Xu is not just close to Mr. Wei.

1002
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,530
He also frequently visits Mr. Liu's bar.

1003
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,190
Uncle Tianye,

1004
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,390
should I look into it?

1005
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,930
No need.

1006
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,630
You rest first.

1007
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,830
Go back and spend time with Xiaomei.

1008
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,830
Ba will handle it.

1009
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,570
But this matter

1010
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,960
must be kept confidential.

1011
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,690
Understood.

1012
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,000
Come on.

1013
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,380
Cheers! Cheers!

1014
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,960
Cheers! Cheers!

1015
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,630
Do you know this game? 15, 20.

1016
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,150
15, 20, 15.

1017
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,450
Are you blind?

1018
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,880
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1019
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,400
Sorry?

1020
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,740
Are your eyes just for breathing?

1021
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,710
Do you need me
to help you cross the street?

1022
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,970
I just bumped into you.

1023
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,370
Can you not touch me?

1024
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,710
I touched you?

1025
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,880
You can't accept it, huh?

1026
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,620
I gave you a chance, but you're useless!
