that your mentor
from the provincial capital

224
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,340
has been taken away by the CDI.

225
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,320
I've been pushing to speed up construction

226
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,750
because I wanted

227
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,940
to invite him to see it
in person after completion.

228
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,480
But now...

229
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,620
Ye.

230
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,550
I remember back in the 90s,

231
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,960
this was just
a bunch of dilapidated factories.

232
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,220
I was working for the township back then.

233
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,070
During a joint inspection,

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
we came here together.

235
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,400
Yes,

236
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,920
that's when we first met.

237
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,070
Hanzhou

238
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,310
isn't the same Hanzhou anymore.

239
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,510
And you today

240
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,060
are not the same person you once were.

241
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,850
All these years, I've been wondering

242
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,680
who was the mastermind

243
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,280
behind my apprentice's downfall.

244
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I never thought

245
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,650
it would be you.

247
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,700
and people change too.

248
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,900

249
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,510

250
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,590

251
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,440
You're wrong.

252
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,020
None of this is your legacy.

253

What you've left behind

256
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,330
is nothing but evil.

257
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
Hanzhou without you

258
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,920
will be better off.

259

I came back.

268
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,070

269
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,880
Yes.

If we cut the weeds,
we cut the roots too.

the final takedown immediately.

405
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,630

406
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,030
Xiong Chao,

407
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,940
the one nicknamed "Guazi," just confessed.

408
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,200
From the Xu Li case years ago

409
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,030
to the series of cases

410
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,070
involving him in recent years,

411
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,700
he confessed to everything in full detail.

412
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,610
All these years,

413
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,970
you two have worked so hard.

414
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,840
I remember when Xiaoyue first arrived,

415
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,410
12 years ago.

416
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,510
He was young,

417
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,670
idealistic,

418
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,360
and energetic.

419
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,480
Watching him

420
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,660
working like a young bull every day,

421
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,190
I was so happy.

422
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,770
Though he made mistakes,

423
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,710
I didn't think it mattered.

424
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,460
For young people,

425
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,740
hitting a few walls
might be good for them.

426
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,330
But I never expected

427
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,310
that I'd be the one hitting the wall.

428
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Someone has to hit that wall,

429
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,310
whether it's you or him.

430
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,200
I just never expected

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,460
that one hit would last for so many years.

432
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,510
They've kept me working until retirement.

433
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,830
But

434
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,090
being able to see this day,

435
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,660
I have no regrets.

436
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,670
Don't talk like that anymore.

437
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,880
With your health,
you'll live to be a hundred.

438
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,010
I've been dreaming
about Xiaoyue again lately.

439
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,010

440

443

00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,550
So many bubbles. So good!

750
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,630
So many bubbles.

751
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,360
Yes.

752
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,510
Is your pinwheel spinning, Baobao?

753
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,460
-No.
-No?

754
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,220
Come over to Grandma. Come here.

755
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,590
Show it to Grandma.

756
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,960
-Uncle Feng.
-Let’s see if the pinwheel is spinning.

757
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,160
-Let’s play together.
-Is it spinning?

758
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,030
Mom.

759
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,550
You're back.

760
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,620
It's good you're back.

761
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,160
It's good you're back.

762
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,410
Mom.

763
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,440
Good girl.

764
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,510
Look.

765
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,940
Baobao, come here.

766
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,310
-Baobao.
-Who is this?

767
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,360
Come quickly.

768
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,370
Mommy.

769
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,670
Did you miss Mommy?

770
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,690
I want a hug too.

771
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,140
Let me give you another one, okay?

772
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,440
The ocean! Look!

773
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,070
-The ocean!
-The ocean!

774
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,150
It's beautiful.

775
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:58,810
Look at the ocean.

776
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,820
[The End]
