Give me the key.

Mai.

5
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,790
I don't think that's a good idea.

6
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,650
If there's any problem, I'll take
responsibility. Just give it to me.

You could have walked away from this,

36
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,030
No way.

Well,

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,860
should we get some blood
on their hands, too?

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,290
I think that's a good approach.

47
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,480
We need to learn

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
Why don't we have some food,

189
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,540
and have a drink together?

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,080
I'll...

191
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,420
I'll go first.

192
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,600
Call me if anything happens, Mentor.

193
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,130
Alright.

194
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,200
You're leaving now?

195
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
You eat first. I'll be back soon.

196
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,550
Today happens to be my day off.

197
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,000
I can drink.

198
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's have some drinks.

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,780
Come on.

200
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,240
I can't drink.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
I've got to head out
with the car in a bit.

202
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I know you've got an issue with me.

203
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,910
About Xu Li's case,

204
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,000
and Xiaoyue's case...

205
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,910
I know you have a lot to say.

206
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,270
Today it's just the two of us.

207
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,300
Whatever's on your mind, just say it.

208
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,120
There's nothing to say.

209
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,150
But you can't keep
being so depressed, can you?

210
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,330
You're different from me.

211
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm already this old.

212
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm retiring in a few years.

213
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,930
You still have a long way to go.

214
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,470
Well, who told you I'm depressed?

215
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,790
Can't I see it for myself?

216
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

217
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,660
Let's not talk about this.

218
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Let's talk about something else.

219
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,510
I have another protégé named Zeng Xu.

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,630
He

221
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,570
really admires you

222
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,670
and has always wanted to meet you.

223
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,730
When you have time,

224
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,280
let's have a meal together.

225
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,510
No.

226
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
I, Mai Hongchao, only have two juniors:

227
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,030
one named Qin Feng

228
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,450
and another named Hu Xiaoyue.

229
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
But Hu Xiaoyue is dead,

230
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,080
and the person who forced him to die

231
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,250
still hasn't been brought to justice.

232
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,510
Xu Li's case,

233
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,150
and Hu Xiaoyue's case...

234
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,330
I haven't forgotten them.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
It's all in my heart.

236
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480
The truth will come to light eventually.

237
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,510
Trust me.

238
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,480
But I just hope you

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,730
can take good care of yourself.

240
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,690
Understand?

241
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,510
Okay.

242
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,650
I'll make contact with Su Hongbao.

243
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,250
As for my situation,

244
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,950
you don't need to worry about it.

245
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,250
If you really want
to do something good for me,

246
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,150
then get to the bottom

247
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,680
of Xiaoyue's case
and Xu Li's case.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,860
That's what would really help me.

249
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,840
What do you mean?

250
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,200
Nothing.

251
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm not used to people
treating me to meals.

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
Where's Tianfei?

253
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,870
I couldn't reach him.

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Where... where's your friend, Mr. Wei?

255
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,470
Mr. Wei...

256
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,070
He should be here soon.

257
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,030
What's in this shipment?

258
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,400
Why is this square-shaped?

259
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,870
Phones?

260
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,240
That must be Mr. Wei.

261
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,030
We're here, Bro.

262
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,890
Is that Mr. Wei?

263
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,150
Peng.

264
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,670
Mr. Wei.

265
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,050
Nice to meet you.

266
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,860
Let me introduce you.

267
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:18,670
[Mr. Wei, Meat Wholesaler]

268
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,440
Mr. Liu.

269
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,870
Mr. Wei.

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
He's the largest meat wholesaler

271
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,060
in the south district of Hanzhou.

272
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,610
Let's talk about the price first.

273
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,790
It's half the market price.

274
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
Is the supply stable?

275
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,320
We have two ships and ten trucks now.

276
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,780
We can deliver twice a day.

277
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,190
Your smuggling business
is doing quite well.

278
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,110
But besides meat,

279
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,160
we can transport anything.

280
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
It just depends on

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,490
whether Mr. Wei wants
to expand the business in Hanzhou.

282
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,200
To be honest,

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,750
I have three wholesale markets
in the south district.

284
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,200
As long as your goods are cheap enough,

285
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,130
I'll move as much as you can supply.

286
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,250
Then it's a deal.

287
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Tianye.

288
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,710
About today's meat business...

289
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,790
He Biao

290
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,900
doesn't know about it, right?

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Wait, you and He Biao...

292
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,790
Mr. Wei, you're working

293
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,660
with Mr. He

294
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,750
as well, huh?

295
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm not familiar with him, either.

296
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
I was just asking casually.

297
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,960
But if we're going

298
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,320
to work together regularly,
I need to understand

299
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,150
how things work around here, right?

300
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,960
Yes.

301
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
My business with Mr. He is one thing.

302
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
This is

303
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
Longwan's own business.

304
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,470
If you have concerns,

305
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,710
I think you should reconsider.

306
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,830
Think it over.

307
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,020
I have no concerns.

308
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,460
Well,

309
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,330
to be honest,

310
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,870
I can't stand He Biao's gang, either.

311
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,720
-Peng and I are friends, right?
-Yes. Yes.

312
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,630
Between us...

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,260
We're on the same team.

314
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,790
We're on the same team.

315
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,630
Then let's

316
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,630
make money together.

317
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,550
Make big money!

318
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,150
Make big money together.

319
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,670
Let me introduce my two bros—

320
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,480
Chen and Ran.

321
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,550
If you need anything, just ask them.

322
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,120
Chen,

323
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,910
Ran.

324
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,000
-Tianye.
-Hello. You're too kind.

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,630
Can you

326
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,910
help unload the cargo?

327
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,120
Come, help out.

328
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,410
So hardworking.

329
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,870
Peng.

330
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,390
How about it? He's reliable, right?

331
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,570
You two bosses are here.

332
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,170
Young Mr. He.

333
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,810
Here are all the goods.

334
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,440
You can check them and move them.

335
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,910
Alright, snap to it.

336
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,680
Copy that.

337
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,120
Here... over to the back.

338
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,630
I heard your child is having a birthday.

339
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,120
I went to a lot of trouble
to scour for this jade Ruyi.

340
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,360
I hope you like it.

341
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,030
-Thank you, Mr. He.
-Muzhi.

342
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,550
Muzhi.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,660
Here, look.

344
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,870
I had someone

345
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,400
bid on this for me

346
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,170
at a Pristie's auction.

347
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,240
Christie's.

348
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,790
Yes.

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,730
Christie's.

350
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,920
Is everything done?

351
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,180
This is a good piece.

352
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,109
An antique.

353
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,200
Not bad.

354
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,510
You guys

355
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,400
handling the shipping

356
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,260
have saved me a massive headache.

357
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,750
Thank you.

358
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
Recently,

359
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,930
our gambling den

360
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,170
has been doing very well,
but we're short-staffed.

361
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,510
I was thinking

362
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,300
if any friends
from Longwan and Zhao Village

363
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,320
want to make some quick money

364
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,270
and help out.

365
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,160
We can work something out.

366
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,200
Well, we're currently

367
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,070
quite busy with our work.

368
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Besides, Young Mr. He is managing
the gambling den very well.

369
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,740
We won't get involved.

370
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,770
If there's nothing else,
we'll be going now.

371
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,240
Thank you, Mr. He.

372
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,790
Wait.

373
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Bring Tianfei over here.

374
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,310

Besides,

560
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,030
according to what Qin Feng told me,

561
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,720
he thinks Su Hongbao had ulterior motives

562
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,230
for hitting Guo Yaoyang.

563
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,590
Because Su Hongbao

564
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,890
used to work for Ma Jin.

565
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
There's no way he'd just come out

566
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,260
and blindly pick fights with people.

567
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,210
And the person behind Guo Yaoyang

568
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,810
likely has connections with Ma Jin, too.

569
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,350
We need to take it seriously.

570
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,790
Well, you start investigating first,

571
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,510

Who are you?

580
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,440
Don't touch me.

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,590
We were just drinking together.

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,830
You're my girlfriend.

Who's your girlfriend?

No, I don't.

Yes, I did.

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,140
I went to his grave
and had a chat with him.

You dressed my old man for his funeral.

For that,

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,460
I'll be grateful for life.

630
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,940
You're trying to bribe me.

631
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,240
Too late. I'm not a cop anymore.

632
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,830

633
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,890

for this drink.

Yes.

642
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,270
I was hoping to thank him
in person when I got out.

643
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,590
He was quite young.

644
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
He was a man of principle.

645
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,960
Everyone has their own fate.

646
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,490
It really is all about fate.

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,020
know Lin?

649
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,030
Yes.

650
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,960
Why?

651
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,400
What do you want with him?

652
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,330
He owes me money.

653
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,430
What exactly is your relationship
with Ma Jin?

654
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,590
Don't you know that?

655
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,200
You were the one who caught me back then.

656
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,750
I just did some errands for him.

657
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,680
What's wrong with that?

658
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,310
I'm asking
what the relationship really is—

659
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,970
why did you take the fall
for him back then?

660
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,840
Forget it. I won't ask anymore.

661
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,340
Now that Ma Jin has fallen,

662
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,780
you should be able to talk, right?

663
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
Who's the person behind him?

664
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,830
Wait, why are you suddenly
asking about this?

665
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,720
He's the one who did Xu Li's case.

666
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,520
Still dwelling on the Xu Li case?

667
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,000
We've both served our time.

668
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,330
Let bygones be bygones.

670
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,030
Your debts are debts, but mine aren't?

671
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,630
We're talking about Xu Li
and Xiaoyue's lives.

672
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,160
This debt must be paid.

673
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,790
Let's make some money

674
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,790
and live our lives well.

675
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,960
Wearing a badge for a few days

676
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,690
doesn't make you a cop for life.

677
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,600
It's been so many years.

678
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
You think this one drinking session

679
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,350
is enough to talk me out of it?

680
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,430
I've only kowtowed
to two people in my life—

681
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,880
To my father

682
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,560
and to you and Hu Xiaoyue.

683
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,430
Both of them are gone now.

684
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,400
Who's Ma Jin?

685
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,030
He's fallen,

686
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,700
and his backers
are completely unaffected.

687
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,820
Who do you think you are?

688
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,020
I'm nobody.

689
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,480
But I really can't let this case go.

690
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,510
Tell me,

691
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,500
who is that person?

692
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,920
I honestly don't know who's behind it all.

693
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,510
But I do know this: he's woven a web

694
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,030
that no one can touch. Do you understand?

695
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,590
Fine.

696
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,610
Now you've got your eyes on He Gang
and He Biao, right?

697
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,830
What's their relationship with Ma Jin?

698
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,960
These two brothers together—

699
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,400
they're just another Ma Jin,

700
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,190
understand?

701
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,640
How do you know this?

702
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,900
These two brothers...

703
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,290
If they didn't have someone backing them,

704
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,980
could they handle Ma Jin's business?

705
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,590
Crazy.

706
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,310
I was drinking with Su Hongbao.

707
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,830
He got drunk and is lying at my place.

708
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,970
He just told me something.

709
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,270
He said that the man
behind He Biao and He Gang

710
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,110
is the exact same person
we've been looking for.

711
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,590
But I feel like
he didn't finish his words.

712
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,680
Do you need to come over?

713
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,160
You go ahead and drink.
I'm not coming.

714
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,880
Then what are you planning to do?

715
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,480
Tomorrow I'll go
with Mr. Ye to Grand Paradise.

716
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,030
You...

717
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,960
You just keep drinking with him.

718
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,410
Alright, that's the plan then.

719
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,630
What are you doing with that?

720
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,310
For self-defense.

721
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,960
Self-defense?
You're collecting debt from a woman.

722
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
Why bring a steel rod?

723
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,310
Well, we're going to collect a debt.

724
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,960
In case things get heated...

725
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,400
What's there to get heated about?
The three of us are grown men.

726
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
He's laughing at you.

727
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,190
Talk to me... Talk to me properly.

728
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,080
Take it away.

729
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,970
I'll hit you.

[Si's Store]

731
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
After everything I've said,

732
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,480
are you even listening to me?

733
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,720
Your husband is dead,

734
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,960
but you still need to pay the debt.

735
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't have money.

736
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,640
No money?

737
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,830
If you don't have money,
give me your store instead.

738
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,890
If you don't leave,

739
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
I'll call the police.

740
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,800
You dare call the police?

741
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,650
What are you doing?

00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,640
Are you okay?

744
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,790
I'm fine.

745
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,240
Zhou...

746
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,480
Zhou Sisi?

747
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,510
Tianye.

748
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,650
Are you alright?

749
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,510
She... she's my high school classmate.

750
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,850
Classmate, huh?

751
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,370
What a coincidence.

752
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,070
Thanks.

753
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
Don't mention it.

754
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,440
But...

755
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,590
your husband...

756
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,440
He owed too much money

757
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,050
and jumped off a building.

758
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,880
Was that

759
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,840
beaten by the debt collectors?

760
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,880
No.

761
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
My husband was the one who beat them.

762
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,200
You should know that your husband

763
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
owes money to He Biao.

764
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,240
So you guys

765
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,410
are also here to collect debt?

766
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
How did you end up
with those people?

767
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,449
Just a twist of fate.

768
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
I remember in high school,

769
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,290
you were a good student,

770
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,480
but then something happened at home,
and you missed the College Entrance Exam.

771
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,540
I dropped out and went into business.

772
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,360
How much does he owe?

773
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,840
Over a million yuan.

774
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,130
Over a million yuan?

775
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,100
Those people just now
wanted over 200,000 yuan.

776
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
That's so much money.

777
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,900
I can't pay it back.

778
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,110
Those people just now are nothing.

779
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,150
Since you owe He Biao money,

780
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,270
he won't let you go.

781
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,260
If we don't come,
others will.

782
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,920
But it's so much money...

783
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,360
I honestly can't pay it back.

784
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,960
You...

785
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,409
Is this place about 80-90 square meters?

786
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,440
Yes.

787
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,640
With a second floor.

788
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,980
The location is actually quite good.

789
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,440
What if I help you
sell this shop?

790
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,260
I've thought about it.

791
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,710
Selling this shop

792
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,440
would only
get a few hundred thousand yuan.

793
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,240
Well, how about I pool some money
together for you?

794
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,480
I'm sorry.

795

[Tired and sleepy?

796
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,720
I can pool some money together for you.

797
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,450
Why are you helping me?

798
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,110
Look, it's not just me helping you—

799
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,320
someone had to do it.

800
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,430
Once you get the money,

801
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,550
you can pay off your debts first,

802
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,030
right?

803
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,530
So is it a deal or not?

804
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,110
If you can really help me,

805
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,010
I trust you, Old Classmate.

806
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,030
Okay.

808
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,720
Well, Tianye.

809
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,440
If I remember correctly,

810
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,570
weren't we supposed to collect a debt?

811
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,150
How come we didn't get a penny

812
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,280
and even
lost several hundred thousand yuan?

813
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,230
What are you laughing at?
I've got to answer to He Biao for this.

814
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,630
I have to help my classmate,

815
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,280
right?

816
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,190
Doesn't your wife

817
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,230
want to get a bigger convenience store?

818
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,230
I think that location is really good.

819
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,160
Ask her about it.

820
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,330

What?

824
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,570
Okay, got it.

825
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,090
What happened?

826
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,080
Mr. Wei was beaten up.

827
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,090
They said it was someone

828
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,850
called Mr. Ba
from the south district who did it.

829
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,180
And he reported
that entire batch of meat.

830
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,030
What should we do?

831
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,030
We have to teach him a lesson, right?

832
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,950
If we're gonna cut him down,
we cut him flat.

833
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,360
We need Uncle Limin to reach out

834
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,030
to Section Chief Qi from the
Administration for Industry and Commerce.

835
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,070
The one who came
for the licensing last time?

836
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,400
We don't have any connection with him.

837
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,760
If there's no connection,
we'll build one.

I heard that

854
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,340
your place was closed
for rectification recently.

855
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,860
That was quick.
