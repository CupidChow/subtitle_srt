00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,208
It's going to be okay.

197
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,666
It's going to be okay.

198
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,375
It's going to be okay.

199
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,541
An anomaly.

200
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,875
Zero?

201
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,958
'In case of anomaly, immediately turn around.'

202
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,833
That's what I did.

203
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:47,708
Isn't it an anomaly then?

204
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,000
What?

205
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,708
Are you lost?

206
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,500
Are you all alone?

207
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,666
Are you with someone?

208
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,583
That...

209
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,708
...he is no longer a man.

210
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,375
WALKING MAN

211
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,708
Yes.

212
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,750
Yeah.

213
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,458
We did it. Let's go.

214
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,375
Come on.

215
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,916
Number eight. Ventilation. Electrical room.

216
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,625
Okay. Ventilation.

217
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:08,916
Okay.

218
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:14,916
Only authorized staff. Sprinkler. Emergency point. OK.

219
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,250
Posters.

220
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:23,625
One, two, three, four...

221
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:28,541
...five, six, seven. Okay.

222
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,166
The cashiers. Lockers.

223
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:41,041
One, two, three, four, five...

224
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,416
Trash. Photo booth.

225
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,750
Did you see anything?

226
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,125
Tell me. Is that it?

227
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,000
Did you see anything?

228
00:40:57,666 --> 00:41:00,333
I can't understand if you don't say anything.

229
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:08,416
I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

230
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:09,916
Come on.

231
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,666
Yes...

232
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,333
Great.

233
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,416
Yes, yes, yes.

234
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,375
Yes.

235
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:25,958
Let's go

236
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,125
Number eight.

237
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,333
Ventilation. Electrical room. OK.

238
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,041
Posters. Shall we count together?

239
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:57,083
One. Two. Three.

240
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,416
Tell me if you see anything, okay?

241
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,458
Five.

242
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,708
Sorry...

243
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,833
Are you lost?

244
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,041
Yes...

245
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,833
I can't get out of here either.

246
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,541
If you don't mind, I can accompany you?

247
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,708
Absolutely.

248
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:34,333
This boy is also lost.

249
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,708
Is that so?

250
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,250
Where do you think we are?

251
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,333
Who knows?

252
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,333
Could it be...

253
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,875
...that we are dead?

254
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,583
That we are in hell?

255
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,875
In purgatory?

256
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:27,208
Are we stuck as punishment for our deeds?

257
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:29,875
Hell?

258
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,458
Do you feel guilty about something?

259
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,416
Guilty?

260
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,833
I'm kidding.

261
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:45,375
It's just a basement corridor.

262
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:54,125
Let's go.

263
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,375
Come on.

264
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,708
Did you notice anything?

265
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,083
There was always...

266
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:19,000
...someone walking towards you from that direction.

267
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,208
An older man.

268
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,000
An older man?

269
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,125
A shady guy.

270
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,750
What do you mean?

271
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,458
He didn't come this time.

272
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,583
But... Is that an anomaly?

273
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,541
Well... I...

274
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,583
Tell me...

275
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,875
Do you really want to get out?

276
00:44:56,166 --> 00:45:00,375
Wouldn't you rather stay here?

277
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:11,041
Take the crowded subway, go to work...

278
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,541
...doing the same thing every day.

279
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,416
That's hell. Just pathetic.

280
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,750
Pathetic?

281
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:27,333
Every day in the crowded subway, every day to work...

282
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,833
...doing the same thing every day.

283
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,458
That's hell. Just pathetic.

284
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,541
Take the crowded subway...

285
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:44,541
...going to work every day, doing the same thing every day.

286
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,666
That's not a h...

287
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,375
What's going on?

288
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,125
Hallo?

289
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,375
Are you ok?

290
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,541
Hey, Miss?

291
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,958
Are you okay?

292
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,000
What is it?

293
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:10,125
Say somethig!

294
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,750
Just pathetic.

295
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,666
Take the crowded subway, go to work...

296
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,416
...doing the same thing every day.

297
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:22,041
That's hell. Just pathetic.

298
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,750
What is this?

299
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:27,916
...back to work. Always the same routine.

300
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,583
Not that way. An anomaly.

301
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,166
An anomaly.

302
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,750
Come with me.

303
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,250
What was that?

304
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,583
Six.

305
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,333
Let's go.

306
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,750
Two more to go.

307
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,208
Two more.

308
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,708
Number eight.

309
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,708
Ventilation. Electrical room. OK.

310
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,333
The posters, One, two...

311
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:34,166
...three, four, five.

312
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,833
Monster.

313
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:42,833
Five, six, seven.

314
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:49,750
No anomalies, right? That's good, isn't it?

315
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:55,250
If we're wrong, we'll never get out of here.

316
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,625
What is it?

317
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,083
Are you still scared?

318
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,875
It's all good.

319
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,250
It's good, I'm here.

320
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:14,250
Come on, let's go.

321
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,083
Let's go, quickly.

322
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:23,583
The lockers. One, two, three, four...

323
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,583
Trash. Photo booth.

324
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,125
No anomalies. Good.

325
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:55,958
Why don't you pay close attention?

326
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,916
Awful instructions.

327
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,333
Get rid of it.

328
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,333
I'm in a hurry.

329
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,875
I was supposed to see my kid today.

330
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,333
Why?

331
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,833
I'm sorry.

332
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,333
Shall we?

333
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,958
Okay... Okay...

334
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,833
Let's go for it. Eight more to go.

335
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,208
Eight to go.

336
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,000
The exit.

337
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,916
Finally.

338
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,625
I can go outside.

339
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,375
Come on!

340
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Come with me.

341
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,375
As you wish.

342
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,083
As you wish.

343
00:54:25,541 --> 00:54:26,708
An anomaly.

344
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:46,041
Isn't it an anomaly then?

345
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,750
What?

346
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,541
Are you lost?

347
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:01,958
Are you all alone?

348
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,208
Are you with someone?

349
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:35,333
That...

350
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,041
...he is no longer a man.

351
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:52,333
Emergency point. Door. Door.

352
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,541
Ventilation.

353
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,833
Door.

354
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,333
Ventilation.

355
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,000
No anomalies.

356
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,833
Aren't you coming?

357
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:19,208
TURN AROUND TURN AROUND TURN AROUND

358
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,833
THE BOY

359
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,333
Aren't you coming?

360
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:31,125
Lockers. One, two, three. One, two, three.

361
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:34,750
Blanket. Cups. Photo booth.

362
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,416
No anomalies.

363
00:56:57,458 --> 00:56:58,583
None...

364
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:11,833
Back to square one.

365
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,875
Exit 8.

366
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:28,250
Dentist.

367
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:30,833
Escher.

368
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,250
Legal Assistant.

369
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,083
Man.

370
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,833
Plastic surgery. Well paid.

371
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:49,208
Good manners in the subway. Security camera.

372
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,333
Emergency point. Door. Door.

373
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:58,750
Ventilation. Door.

374
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,375
Ventilation.

375
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:12,750
What?

376
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:19,125
It seems to have changed.

377
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,416
An anomaly.

378
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,458
Wait. An anomaly.

379
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,875
Hey.

380
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,833
Shit....

381
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,125
Now we have to start again.

382
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,000
Let's go.

383
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,333
Exit 8.

384
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:31,833
Dentist.

385
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:34,166
Escher.

386
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:36,416
Legal Assistant.

387
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,833
Man.

Come on, come on.

395
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,083
An anomaly.

396
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,333
We turn around.

397
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,875
Good.

01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,000
What?

My phone...

401
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,750
My phone...

402
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,000

Mom? -Huh?

406
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,333
I'm sorry, Mama.

407
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,333
What? Mom?

408
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:19,416
Mom, Wait.

409
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,333
That's not your mom. -Mama.

410
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,958
Let go of me. -No.

411
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,458
You are wrong.

412
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,416
Mama.

413
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,916
We have to go back. -Mama.

414
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,250
Mama.

415
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,166
Mama...

416
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,458
What do you want to do?

417
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,958
What do you want to do?

418
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:57,666
What do you want to do?

419
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,041
Are you okay?

420
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,333
Have you lost your mother?

421
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,625
Intentionally.

422
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:57,875
I did it on purpose...

423
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,166
...I was being stupid.

424
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:04,250
Why?

425
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,125
So that she would look for me.

426
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,625
Oh yeah?

427
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:17,041
I have done that too once.

428
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,541
Are you afraid of your mom?

429
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,666
When she is angry.

430
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:38,458
That's true for all mothers.

431
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,208
And your dad?

432
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,708
I've never known him.

433
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,833
I see.

434
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,833
Me neither.

435
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:11,541
Well, you must go back to your mother.

436
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,750
I have to go home too.

437
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:21,333
Come on.

438
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:23,000
We're going.

01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,208
Upside down.

441
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,125
Correct, the number eight is upside down.

442
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,750
We're going back.

443
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,833
Three more to go.

444
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,625
Exit 8.

445
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:38,833
Okay.

446
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,708

Say this.

452
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:15,750
What do you want to do if we manage to get out?

453
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,833
Eat a pizza. -A pizza?

454
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,000
A pizza with lots of cheese.

455
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,249
That sounds good.

456
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,833
Me...

457
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,666
I'm not so sure anymore.

458
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,249
It's beautiful.

459
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:01,124

460
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:06,500

01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,166
Thank you.

463
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,083
Come on.

464
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,541
Two more to go.

465
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:46,916
Exit 8.

466
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,958
OK. -OK.

474
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:16,999
Come here.

475
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,833
He is soaking wet.

476
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,833
It's safe.

477
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:58,000
Pope.

478
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:01,833
What do you want to do?

479
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,541
He?

480
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,583
He's calling.

481
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:17,750
Come on, be brave, Dad.

482
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,041
Sometimes I doubt.

483
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,375
Is it good...

484
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:33,083
...to see yourself like this?

485
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:42,874
No one knows which way is the right one.

486
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,124
But it will be alright.

487
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,458
You will protect this child.

488
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:04,708
And one day, he will protect you too.

489
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,625
Mama.

490
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,125

Hallo...

516
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,375
Hello.

517
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,833
Hello.

518
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,833
Where are you?

519
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:46,041
Still in the hospital.

520
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:53,958
I'm on my way.

521
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,375
What do you want to do?

522
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:08,083
Well... We...

I'm sorry...

527
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:19,666
You're the mother, shut him up.

528
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:27,041
Come on, bitch. Just shut him up, dammit.

529
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:30,166
What a great idea to take a baby on the subway...

530
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,041
...with a baby during rush hour?

531
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,000
Even for the kid, it's a nightmare.

532
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,333
What are you looking at?

533
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,666
Do you think I'm joking or something?
