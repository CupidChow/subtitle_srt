00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,120
=Shining Stars=

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
I want to go home.

3
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,760
What about you?

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Go for it!

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,000
Go for it!

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Just 20 meters left.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,520
I want to go home.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,680
Go home.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Ten meters.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,880
We have about three meters left.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,240
Shall we leave then?

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,160
It's very close.

13
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:11,013
(A mysterious abandoned hospital)

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
What's the matter?

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,360
(Trips with left foot over right)
Be careful.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,120
It's okay.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
We are now

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,960
at the iron gate.

19
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:26,880
(Entering the hospital)

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,400
Be careful.

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,720
Be careful.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
There's an iron gate.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,040
Watch out.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,120
What iron gate?

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,520
Come on.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
I heard some footsteps.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,040
That's ours.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,987
(Startle)

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,480
Remove your blindfold now.

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,280
He said we can remove

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,920
our blindfold now.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,600
It's okay now.

33
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,040
(This story is fictional)

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
(Weizhou Island is bountiful,)

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
(with treasures everywhere.)

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,360
(Treasure hunters
flock here by reputation,)

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,080
(yet all are nowhere to be found.)

38
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,696
(Rumors had it)

39
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,456
(that the place where the treasure is)

40
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:13,320
(Friendly reminder: You have entered the video surveillance area)
(full of dangers.)

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Is it that scary?

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Help.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,440
Flashlights on the ground.

44
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:25,553
(Two flashlights)

45
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,080
(The gate is locked)

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
(This is not good)

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
Let us out!

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
Let us out!

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,520
Let us out!

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Let us out!

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,880
(Why did you climb up?)

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Let us out!

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
Let us out!

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
What is this for?

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't scare me.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Why are you scaring me?

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,040
Spark.

58
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,360
(Eh)

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
Spark.

60
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,512
(A mysterious person suddenly appears)

61
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,480
Can you keep it down?

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,308
(Ask them to keep it down)

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,400
There are security in this hospital.

64
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,040
(Hide)

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,680
If the security guards find you,

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,160
they will kick us out.

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
They will kick us out.

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,520
That would be great.

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Kick me out now.

70
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,800
(Just what we wanted)

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,520
Aren't you patients here?

72
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,766
(Us?)

73
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,021
(What to do?)

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
I am.

75
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,736
(I can be one)

76
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:28,384
(Am I so dumb?)

77
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,069
(Then)

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
You have to...

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,760
It's a psychiatric hospital.

80
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
He is a patient.

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
Look at him.

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,586
(Act now)

83
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,597
(Pretend)

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Forget it.

85
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Let me ask you something.

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,560
Rabbit apple, take a bite.

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,600
(Excited, chicken skewer)
Chicken skewer, delicious.

88
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,040
(Confident)

89
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,240
Jiu has had me waiting here
for you guys for a long time

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,680
You are our companion?

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Yes.

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,440
I am Explorer K.

93
00:04:01,536 --> 00:04:02,560
(The mysterious person is Explorer K)

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Try your best

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,760
(Move swiftly)
not to expose yourselves.

96
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,080
The securities are troublesome.

97
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
And the patients here

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
behave very strangely.

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,040
Where are the patients?

100
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,960
Patients...

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,080
If I'm not mistaken,

102
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,520
you guys must be
the Four Bamboo Masters, right?

103
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes.

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,640
(Don't forget him)
And Xingbao.

105
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,760
Right. Then it's confirmed.

106
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
(Correct)
Correct.

107
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,982
(What's that noise?)

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,040
Then that's correct.

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
Correct.

110
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,960
(Stop it right away)
Don't scare us, okay?

111
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:27,840
(Well-behaved)

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,200
Well,

113
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
I'll share with you

114
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,720
the information I got.

115
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:39,226
(Scared)

116
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:40,234
Startle.

117
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,560
(Needs protection)

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,720
My master,

119
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Adventurer Q,

120
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,320
is also a seasoned explorer.

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,360
I followed his footsteps to come here.

122
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,200
But I've lost contact with him.

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,800
The location he sent me

124
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,400
is right here.

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Right here?

126
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
So I came to this hospital.

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

128
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,200
This hospital has four treasures.

129
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,836
(There are four treasures
hidden inside the hospital)

130
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:06,957
(Search nearby)

131
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
Come here, Mu Sheng.

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
Come here, Mu Sheng.

133
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,456
(I can't be afraid)

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,400
It's okay.

135
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,120
He's a patient.

136
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,263
(Dare not approach)

137
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
Protect me, Sheng.

138
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:35,760
(Check the situation)

139
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,280
(Temporarily safe)
I'm scared.

140
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,240
(Thoughtful)
I think we should try to be bold.

141
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,760
We are explorers.

142
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
We are professionals.

143
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,720
Professional.

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Yes, passion!

145
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
(Life should be about passion)
Passion!

146
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,880
What are you doing?

147
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,480
What are you doing?

148
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
What are you doing out there?

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
(Noises attracting the security)

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
Who are you people?

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
Are you here to steal things?

152
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,560
Stand over there.

153
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,240
He's coming.

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,680
He's coming.

155
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,160
What?

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Who I'm with now.

157
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,360
Who's first?

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Him.

159
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
Follow him.

160
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,280
Stand over there.

161
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,160
He's coming.

162
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I become the first one?

163
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,560
It's okay.

164
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Protect me, Sheng.

165
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,440
You ran quite fast.

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
He's definitely coming.

167
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,960
I'll distract the security.

168
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,640
Stop right there.

169
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,200
Don't run.

170
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,024
(Dare not move)

171
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,718
(Four Bamboo Masters)

172
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:27,769
(Light)

173
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,240
He's coming.

174
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,640
He can't see us.

175
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,226
(Security leaves)

176
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:38,017
(Safe)

177
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,280
(Ah)

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,120
Mu Sheng.

179
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,137
(Protect)

180
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm scared.

181
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:49,183
(Close the door)

182
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,400
(Adventurer K returns)

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Are you all right?

184
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,440
You think?

185
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,640
Why did you run so fast?

186
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,480
There was someone here just now.

187
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,360
There was a woman,

188
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,880
screaming out.

189
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,280
Where?

190
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
In there.

191
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,313
(Check)

192
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
I think he's going to die.

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
This door can't open.

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Can't open it.

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Wake up.

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
For the sake of System.

197
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,240
Go.

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,720
Let's go.

199
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,960
We need to proceed.

200
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,372
(Find the treasure)

201
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,280
(Setting off again)

202
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,000
Nothing's here.

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
It's fine.

204
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:33,809
(Peeking)

205
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
This is safer.

206
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,920
You guys wait here for me.

207
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,800
He said this is safe,

208
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,160
but it's

209
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,880
not safe for sure.

210
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:45,560
(See through K)

211
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,160
I'll go up to make sure
everything is fine

212
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,960
and no one's there,

213
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,680
then I'll come to pick you up.

214
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,017
(K leaves again)

215
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,680
We must stick together.

216
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
There's a door here.

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,320
(Retreat first)
We...

218
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,158
(Dare not approach)

219
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,840
Sheng.

220
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,760
Come out.

221
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Mu Sheng.

222
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,480
(Escaping the building)

223
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,520
Mu Sheng.

224
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,024
(One is missing)

225
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:30,368
(Half a minute ago, escaping)

226
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Come here.

227
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
(K leads away the patient)
Come here.

228
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,380
(Sheng hiding in the stairwell corner)

229
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,160
We fly apart when disaster strikes.

230
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,920
(K returns
after leading away the patient)

231
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Did you see that person in white?

232
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,080
Yes.

233
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
Mu Sheng.

234
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,840
Where's your talisman?

235
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,240
Take out your talisman.

236
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,960
Did you bring it?

237
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,320
No.

238
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
My peach blossom talisman.

239
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
I've already lured him away.

240
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay.

241
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,080
I found something important
on the second floor.

242
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,320
(K finds information
on the second floor)

243
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,880
Follow me.

244
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,040
I'll go with you.

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,680
You're not any good.

246
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,400
Why every time

247
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,720
when we encountered bad people,

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
you were never there

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,400
and ran very fast?

250
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,200
First, I need to distract the security,

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
then go up there

252
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,240
to ensure your safety.

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,560
If

254
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,400
there are bad guys,

255
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,720
then you go up first to be eaten by him.

256
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
(Excuse me?)
Then we run away, right?

257
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:28,760
(Such strong logic)

258
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Although it sounds a bit cruel.

259
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,840
But I can do it.

260
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,400
Okay.

261
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
(Perfect answer)
We'll go to

262
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,120
the second floor.

263
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,640
Let's go.

264
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,160
You guys...

265
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
(Shield)
You go first.

266
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
It's your show.

267
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,520
It's not about me.

268
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,080
You guys...

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
The Four Bamboo Masters

270
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
must share weal and woe.

271
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,080
Don't be afraid.

272
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,600
He said

273
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,560
he'd sacrifice himself.

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,600
Be careful.

275
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,320
Stay safe.

276
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:54,972
(Arriving at the second floor)

277
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
Alright.

278
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,280
Time to wake up.

279
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,520
What is this?

280
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,520
Is it the treasure?

281
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,576
(All about treasure hunt)

282
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,320
This is a clue left by my Master Q.

283
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:15,157
(What does the letter Q signify?)

284
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Is it the password?

285
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,120
This is the staircase

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,080
we took just now.

287
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,280
(Map of the building)

288
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
This is the staircase

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
we took just now.

290
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,040
Walk through this corridor

291
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,840
and we will

292
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,120
find X at the very end.

293
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,728
(Find the "X")

294
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,880
Right?

295
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,640
Your analysis makes sense.

296
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:43,960
(Impressive)

297
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Why don't you give it a try?

298
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,335
(Just do it)

299
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,760
Let's do it together.

300
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,960
(We're in this together)

301
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,600
Let's go.

302
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
(I won't go in first)
Let's go.

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
Let's go.

304
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,400
(Me, neither)
Let's go.

305
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,920
Who is there?

306
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,800
Who is there?

307
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
(Hurry up)
The security.

308
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,080
Wait.

309
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,960
(Where are we going?)
Where are we going?

310
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,680
Where are we going?

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Let's come in here first.

312
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
Spark. Explode!

313
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Spark. Explode!

314
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,040
Spark. Explode!

315
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:29,088
(Entering the archive room)

316
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,785
(Observing the surroundings)

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Why did you lock us up?

318
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,083
(We have a problem)

319
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,400
The security may come up.

320
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Let's decide

321
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,720
who will go to the end of the corridor.

322
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,840
(Zero hesitation)
He will.

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
Let's vote.

324
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,440
Let's be fair.

325
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
Let's vote.

326
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,840
(Mu Sheng is the best)

327
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,200
Those who vote for Xu.

328
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:00,687
(Passed unanimously)

329
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,430
(You guys...)

330
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,520
Will someone accompany him?

331
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,540
(Waiting for someone brought by fate)

332
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
Mu Sheng.

333
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
We will accompany him.

334
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,720
And you guys stay here.

335
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,076
(Splitting up)

336
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,040
Let's go.

337
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,880
Drama fans, sorry.

338
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
I have been punished.

339
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
(See you)
Let's end this game.

340
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
I'll search for the thing.

341
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,760
No rush.

342
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,880
Wait.

343
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,320
Look what's on the floor.

344
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,000
Look.

345
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,360
Miaomiao.

346
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,840
Look what's on the ground.

347
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,440
Here.

348
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,600
A cockroach.

349
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Hurry up.

350
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
What?

351
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,880
Run!

352
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,120
A cockroach has come in.

353
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh no.

354
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,652
(Escaping from the archive room)

355
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
(What about me?)
I'll be here alone?

356
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
(How dare I go in there?)
Why are there bugs?

357
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,200
It's okay.

358
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
I'll take care of the bugs.

359
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
Take it out.

360
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
It's fine.

361
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,160
Why are you pulling me?

362
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm not the bug.

363
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,200
Let me have it.

364
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
Here you are.

365
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Why are you closing it?

366
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,680
I don't mind.

367
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
Startle.

368
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
To keep the security guard out.

369
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,080
You almost took off my clothes.

370
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,880
There is

371
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,000
something suspicious here.

372
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,360
The treasure.

373
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,240
It will transform.

374
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,640
Hurry up.

375
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,440
It's very scary.

376
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:17,760
Okay?

377
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
This door is unlocked.

378
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,833
(Don't scare me)

379
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,920
Take it first.

380
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
It's a certificate.

381
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,040
We don't need it.

382
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:26,840
(We don't?)

383
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,080
It says there are clues here.

384
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,360
Are there clues here?

385
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:30,788
(Asking directly)

386
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,080
There should be something, right?

387
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:37,095
(No useful clues were found)

388
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,136
(Archive room)

389
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:41,103
(Protective)

390
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,560
This way.

391
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,240
At the end.

392
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,160
In the last room.

393
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,280
It's fine.

394
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,200
It's safe here.

395
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
Dear System.

396
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,960
Stay safe.

397
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,000
Please be careful.

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,640
Mu Sheng.

399
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,120
No problem.

400
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,720
It's safe here.

401
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,800
It's fine.

402
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,440
Let me scout.

403
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
Let me scout.

404
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Spark.

405
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,120
Explode!

406
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,720
Spark.

407
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,760
Explode!

408
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,429
(Retreating)

409
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,591
(Better stay on the back)

410
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,880
(Staying alert)
Don't cover your ears.

411
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,440
Watch the front.

412
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,080
I'll watch the back.

413
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:20,689
(Can't hear)

414
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,680
Someone might be in this room.

415
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,920
Why are we so obedient

416
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,640
and going to the end of the corridor?

417
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,200
To get something.

418
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,072
(Playing again)

419
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
Mu Sheng.

420
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,091
(Bathroom)

421
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,960
Let's squat down. Let him fetch it.

422
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,880
We just squat.

423
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
Okay, let's squat here.

424
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:01,978
(Halting)

425
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:03,758
(Be careful, Sheng)

426
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:07,090
(Scouting)

427
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,840
Don't be afraid.

428
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,400
Squat here

429
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,640
and listen in all directions.

430
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,600
(Politely declined)
No, thanks.

431
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,320
I'll get Sister Mu.

432
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,026
(Needing Sister Mu's company)

433
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,679
(Sister Mu is scared)

434
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Give it to me.

435
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,200
(Found a table)

436
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,160
What is this?

437
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
What is this?

438
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,360
Z.

439
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
2.

440
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,000
Is this a 2 or a Z?

441
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:53,510
(What does the number
in the photo mean?)

442
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,200
This is...

443
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
This is the building to our right.

444
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,120
This is the building across from us.

445
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
This way.

446
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,840
Slow down.

447
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,000
You can get out from here.

448
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,040
Slow down.

449
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,360
Slow down.

450
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Slow down.

451
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,760
Be careful.

452
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
(Archives room)
I was freaked out.

453
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,240
Hurry. Is there anything?

454
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,600
Yeah.

455
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,131
(Found a box)

456
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,972
(Hesitating)

457
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,760
Let me remind you.

458
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Get ready to run.

459
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,400
It will be triggered
as soon as I take it.

460
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay, let's go first.

461
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,160
Let's go first.

462
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
We're leaving.

463
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,884
(Leaving first)

464
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,720
She is a patient.

465
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,360
It doesn't stop.

466
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,880
A patient?

467
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
(Staggering)
She's a patient.

468
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
(Meeting up)
I was freaked out.

469
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,720
I was freaked out.

470
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
Look.

471
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,880
Look at my clothes.

472
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:18,720
(Handmade holes)

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,640
(Sorry)

474
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
Were you the one screaming?

475
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,320
It was her.

476
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,274
(Screams Deluxe, Ah!)

477
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
Your reaction was

478
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,960
absolutely perfect.

479
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,040
We just abandoned

480
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,120
our teammate.

481
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,040
We were also perfect.

482
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,412
(It's okay)

483
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
I found it.

484
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,400
What is this?

485
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
(Four Bamboo Masters' badge)
Our badge.

486
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,160
Yeah.

487
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,120
We found a photo.

488
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
That's the building across.

489
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
(The opposite building)

490
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,960
Look at the number on this building.

491
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,440
Two.

492
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,120
So this is Building No. 2.

493
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
Let's go downstairs.

494
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Let's go.

495
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,920
Downstairs.

496
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's go downstairs.

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
Beg me.

498
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
I dare not.

499
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,800
It's fine, I'll be at the front.

500
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,480
There's nothing going on here.

501
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,240
It's okay.

502
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,135
(Always be vigilant)

503
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,098
(Are you still mentally stable?)

504
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
Was this door locked when you arrived?

505
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
Yeah, it was.

506
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,280
So we should look for the key, right?

507
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,640
Where is the key?

508
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,920
It's very likely
in the building across as well.

509
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,080
No problem.

510
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,320
Just keep that lady in red

511
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
away from us.

512
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,200
Yixu.

513
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,240
Xingbao.

514
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,880
We've already lost a teammate.

515
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,240
No.

516
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,400
We have to save him.

517
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Let's save Xingbao.

518
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,320
We need to find the key.

519
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,228
(Go to Building 2
to search for the key and badge)

520
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,840
What does it say?

521
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,417
(Vaccination Room)

522
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,518
(Open on Vaccination Day)

523
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,469
(Vaccination Room)

524
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,040
Nothing here.

525
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Nothing.

526
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,560
There's nothing.

527
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
(Clear inside for now)
There are mosquitoes.

528
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,720
(Mosquitos have returned)
I've been bitten several times.

529
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
There must be someone.

530
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,680
I'll go

531
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,440
take a look.

532
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,080
Where is the key?

533
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
Are there any clues?

534
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,376
(Entering another room)

535
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,000
(A glowing object spotted)
Here's a clue.

536
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,640
There's a clue.

537
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,080
There's a clue.

538
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,600
But we must be alert at all times.

539
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,920
It might lead...

540
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,200
I see you.

541
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,520
The security is here.

542
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,480
I see you.

543
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,320
The security is here.

544
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,960
The security is here.

545
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,040
I'll lure him away.

546
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,800
When you're done here,

547
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,680
check the second floor.

548
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,560
Stop.

549
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,520
I'll play the cameraman.

550
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,680
I'll play the cameraman.

551
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,446
(Miaomiao's filming perspective)

552
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:34,362
(As expected of you)

553
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,440
There's a clue here.

554
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
I think

555
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,640
(With my escape room experience)
once we take this clue,

556
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,880
this light

557
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,080
may go out immediately.

558
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,680
I think.

559
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
Someone may come out from there.

560
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,280
They've come out.

561
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Mu Sheng.

562
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,160
Sheng.

563
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,600
Sheng.

564
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,920
They've come out.

565
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
Mu Sheng.

566
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:59,012
(Ahhh)

567
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:03,371
(Quick reaction)

568
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Take it.

569
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,080
I'll do it.

570
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,760
Hold it.

571
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:12,241
(Sheng, I'll help you.)

572
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,622
(Back off)

573
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,920
Love and peace.

574
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
Love and peace.

575
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:18,528
(I'll help too)

576
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,840
(When all dangers come at me, you'll
kneel before the cape of justice.)

577
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,800
Take this move.

578
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Come on.

579
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
(Joining in)
Take this.

580
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,200
Love and peace.

581
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,080
Love and peace.

582
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,200
Take this move.

583
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,880
Come on.

584
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,600
Take this move.

585
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:36,480
(Found a badge)

586
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,984
(When did you find this?)

587
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:38,848
(Looking for the badge while scared)

588
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,186
(Strolling around)

589
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,182
(Got the badge)

590
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,400
What else?

591
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
The key.

592
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
It might not be here.

593
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Now that we've

594
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
found the badge here,

595
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,880
the key might be hidden upstairs.

596
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
Then let's go to the second floor.

597
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,320
Let's go.

598
00:21:58,697 --> 00:21:59,884
(Being cautious as soon as they go out)

599
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,360
The clue he just gave us

600
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,920
is to search floor by floor.

601
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,040
We're done with this floor.

602
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,240
Now we need to go up, right?

603
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,280
Is the key not here?

604
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:23,360
(Nothing)

605
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Let's go up.

606
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Shall we?

607
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,520
Yes.

608
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,400
We must find the key and then get out.

609
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Right.

610
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
(Heading to the second floor
of Building No. 2)

611
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,920
Be careful.

612
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,755
(Looking around)

613
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,920
No light over there.

614
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:41,984
(No light at the end of the right side)

615
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,160
There is light here.

616
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Let's start on this side.

617
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,320
It's the OB department.

618
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:53,720
(Disinfection Room)

619
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
There is a box inside.

620
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
Look.

621
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,480
(There's a box)

622
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,720
A box?

623
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,400
Let's go get it.

624
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
It must be a clue.

625
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,680
There's something.

626
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,320
Come and look.

627
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
What does it say?

628
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:04,800
(The earthly demons count 7-what? Which number's square is 81?
What mountain did the Buddha suppress Sun Wukong with?)

629
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,680
The earthly demons count 7-what?

630
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,680
71.

631
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
No. 72.

632
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,280
(72 earthly demons)
Alright?

633
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
Okay.

634
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,760
As the master

635
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
of the Mu family, you're...

636
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,040
(I'm simply scared.)

637
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
72 earthly demons.

638
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,680
So, two here.

639
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,000
Which number's square is 81?

640
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,600
That's nine.

641
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
The second is nine.

642
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
Nine's square is 81.

643
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
So, two and nine.

644
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,840
What mountain did the Buddha
suppress Sun Wukong with?

645
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,040
The mountain was...

646
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,960
Huaguo Mountain.

647
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,600
Is it 293?

648
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,178
(The combination is 293?)

649
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,480
(Unlock failed)
What mountain did the Buddha suppress Sun Wukong with?

650
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,360
Five Finger Mountain.

651
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
It's five.

652
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,880
(Sun Wukong was pinned under Five Finger Mountain
and was the king of Huaguo Mountain.)

653
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,120
295.

654
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Xingbao, protect us.

655
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Help us.

656
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,320
Help us.

657
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,600
(Retrieve Xingbao)

658
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,680
Let's take it out first.

659
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:55,000
(Agreed)

660
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Open it on the first floor.

661
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,640
It's safer.

662
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,120
Let's go.

663
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Square...

664
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,720
(He's still working on the puzzle)
Eighty...

665
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Nine's square...

666
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,040
Nine.

667
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
It should be nine, right?

668
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,000
There is security here.

669
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,400
What's it?

670
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,320
The last one is five.

671
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm sure.

672
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,520
No, I mean...

673
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
Do you take them as nothing?

674
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,720
K?

675
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
You're finally here.

676
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,480
Where did you go?

677
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
I distracted the security.

678
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,720
Quick. Come here.

679
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,000
I feel this is the safest place now.

680
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,520
Hurry up.

681
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,160
You guys, hurry over.

682
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,720
Sister Mu, why are you glowing?

683
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,280
Don't scare me.

684
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
I'll stay here for now

685
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,360
to play the cameraman.

686
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,040
Don't block him.

687
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,219
(Continuing
to occupy the camera position)

688
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Is it open?

689
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
There are four treasures
in this hospital.

690
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,280
Leave now.

691
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,920
Go.

692
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,400
The box.

693
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
What's this?

694
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Hurry.

695
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,960
Hurry.

696
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,880
I have one.

697
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,720
There are four treasures.

698
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,880
I have three.

699
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,440
(Three badges found)
There's one more.

700
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,840
Bro,

701
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,440
isn't your master an explorer?

702
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,200
Why haven't you given us anything?

703
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,440
We found everything on our own.

704
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
What's in this bag?

705
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,360
There's something very important
in the bag.

706
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,960
What is it?

707
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:24,929
(Retreating)

708
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,560
A smoke bomb

709
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,400
to knock us out.

710
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,760
You're a good person.

711
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,720
(Mild praise)
Thank you.

712
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,200
So now we have three puzzle pieces.

713
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,280
We need to find the key.

714
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,480
Everything on the first floor
has been found.

715
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
Now only the second floor is left.

716
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,720
Sheng.

717
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,560
Protect me, Sheng.

718
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Okay.

719
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,477
(Yu's frenzied guardian)

720
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,560
Let's go.

721
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,840
Sheng.

722
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,520
Protect me, Sheng.

723
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,280
(Full HP and max combat power)
Okay.

724
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,800
Take care of each other.

725
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,120
Okay.

726
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,200
Okay. Let's take it slow.

727
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,280
Mu Sheng.

728
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
Remember to protect me.

729
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,040
Okay.

730
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:02,784
(I'll hold your hand.)

731
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Let's find a place
with ceiling lighting.

732
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
And take photos.

733
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,560
A place with ceiling lighting.

734
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,360
And take photos.

735
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,000
Good photos.

736
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,280
Listen.

737
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,240
The camera spot is here.

738
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
So someone will come.

739
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm leaving now.

740
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,591
(You're so smart)

741
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,560
I'm going ahead.

742
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,760
How about

743
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,600
we split up?

744
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,160
You go up.

745
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,240
We'll wait downstairs.

746
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,760
You go up.

747
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,920
We'll wait downstairs.

748
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
(What are you saying?)
You're leaving me alone?

749
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,440
No.

750
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,040
We won't do that.

751
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,960
The Four Bamboo Masters

752
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
are inseparable.

753
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:36,105
(We won't forget the slogan)

754
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,400
We searched this room.

755
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
There should be a room ahead.

756
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Let's squat down.

757
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Back then...

758
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,040
Back then,

759
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,440
when Resentful Woman transformed,

760
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,720
Mu Sheng also went alone.

761
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,880
This time, I

762
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,560
and your sister

763
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,200
will also entrust you to go alone.

764
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:15,887
(Without me, this home would fall apart)

765
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:18,541
(Search for clues on both sides
at the same time)

766
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Sheng,

767
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,320
there is a camera here.

768
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,600
And the light is on inside.

769
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
There's something inside.

770
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,280
Someone's there.

771
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,320
Someone's there.

772
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,440
Don't scare us.

773
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,000
Fear not.

774
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,280
He didn't come.

775
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,120
No.

776
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,120
Miaomiao, hide first.

777
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,800
Sister Mu,

778
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll take you to a safe place.

779
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Let's go.

780
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,920
(Running is the best strategy)
Where are you two going again?

781
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,360
Where are you going?

782
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,400
Let the men take care of these things.

783
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,800
We have this stool for protection.

784
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,680
We can see in all directions.

785
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,800
What's the sound?

786
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
I'll distract him.

787
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,000
Go in and take the thing.

788
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,120
No.

789
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,080
I'll just take him down.

790
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,400
Wait...

791
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,080
Okay.

792
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,680
Then you go in

793
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,720
and take the thing.

794
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
He is blind, right?

795
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,480
See if he is blind or not.

796
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,840
(A patient with poor vision but keen hearing and sense of smell)
What's this smell?

797
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,520
How can those two be so calm?

798
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,760
I didn't expect this.

799
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,000
(There's a box)
You all want to take my treasure.

800
00:28:56,512 --> 00:28:57,633
(Attracting his attention)

801
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:14,520
(Perfect understanding)

802
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,040
Slow down.

803
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,840
Let's go. I got it.

804
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,360
(Got the key)

805
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,160
One more to go.

806
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,200
It should be that one.

807
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,720
Let's go.

808
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,760
You two didn't even call out.

809
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,600
You did great.

810
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,680
He's keen on listening.

811
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,560
Should you go, we'd be doomed.

812
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:27,560
(That's harsh)

813
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,120
Let's go.

814
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,680
You two should work together to get one.

815
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
You're overthinking it.

816
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't take something so seriously.

817
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,880
Sheng!

818
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
What's the smell?

819
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:52,048
(Making noise)

820
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,680
Stairs ahead. Watch out.

821
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,200
He's just pretending to listen.

822
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,320
In fact, he can see.

823
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,720
Right.

824
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,440
(Thank you, kind one.
Otherwise I would still be in the dark.)

825
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,200
He can do more.

826
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
He has a headset.

827
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,080
Lights are on.

828
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
Lights are on.

829
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,600
Be careful.

830
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,160
Someone may suddenly show up.

831
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Liu, light up for me.

832
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,988
(Come on)

833
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
Come in. No one's here.

834
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,960
No one else can get in, right?

835
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
They have no way to get in.

836
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:54,560
(Let me take a look)

837
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,240
Mu Sheng,

838
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,680
go for it.

839
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,760
I'll close the door for you.

840
00:30:56,832 --> 00:30:58,640
(Seriously?)

841
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,240
Mu Sheng,

842
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,840
call us when you're done.

843
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,440
Let's go.

844
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,600
Brother Liu,

845
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,440
you guys act first.

846
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
We'll clean up.

847
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,320
Come on in.

848
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,200
Hurry.

849
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,840
Everyone, just scare them at will.

850
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,720
Let's hide.

851
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,120
Let's count to three
and lift this cloth.

852
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,560
Okay.

853
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,680
Why aren't they screaming at all?

854
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,440
Fear not.

855
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
We'll protect you.

856
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,960
Fear not.

857
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,920
We'll protect you.

858
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:56,640
(Are you sure?)

859
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,952
(Ahhh)

860
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,360
Help!

861
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,000
Help!

862
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:12,080
(Ahhh)

863
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,920
Help!

864
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,120
Help!

865
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,520
Miaomiao!

866
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,840
(Taking the badge)
Help!

867
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,800
Miaomiao!

868
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,880
Help!

869
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,160
Miaomiao!

870
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,680
Don't move.

871
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,000
Miaomiao!

872
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,840
Miaomiao!

873
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,440
Lights.

874
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,160
Miaomiao?

875
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:38,592
(Where is Miaomiao?)

876
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
I, Mu Ziqi, swear to heaven

877
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,160
that if I ever carelessly lose you,

878
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,480
no matter how far

879
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I have to backtrack
and how much effort it takes,

880
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
I will surely find you.

881
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,040
Miaomiao!

882
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Sheng!

883
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,920
Miaomiao!

884
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,840
Miaomiao!

885
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,360
Miaomiao!

886
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm here.

887
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,000
It's okay.

888
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,920
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

889
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,960
He...

890
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,520
He...

891
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,160
He is always smiling.

892
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,840
Don't fear him.

893
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
We are right here.

894
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,120
I faced danger

895
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,280
and let Miaomiao run away by herself.

896
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,880
(I'm sorry)

897
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,320
I left Miaomiao alone.

898
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,240
Miaomiao?

899
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,120
(I'm here)

900
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
You are here.

901
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,400
Liu Fuyi,

902
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,200
a ghost is behind you.

903
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,040
Don't talk.

904
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
Don't talk.

905
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:00,958
(A new type of defense)

906
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,640
What's the Demon Trap Tower's spell?

907
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,080
The immortal appear with bright stars.

908
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,480
(Capture her)
Capture her.

909
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,808
The immortal appear with bright stars.

910
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:13,898
Where light meets darkness,
greatness is achieved.

911
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,063
Demon Trap Tower,

912
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:15,839
go.

913
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,320
(Go)
Demon Trap Tower, go.

914
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,120
Go.

915
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,520
It didn't work.

916
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,160
Spark.

917
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,240
(Explode)
Explode!

918
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,720
Spark.

919
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Explode!

920
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,400
Maybe she isn't from this series.

921
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:31,440
(Not the same world)

922
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,080
Let's go down.

923
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,840
We have everything.

924
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,640
(I'll go too)
Let's go.

925
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
Let's go.

926
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,040
Let's go.

927
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,880
Are you okay?

928
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,920
Let's go.

929
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,320
Slow down.

930
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
Wait a moment.

931
00:35:04,782 --> 00:35:07,347
(Still lingering at the gate)

932
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,240
When did K arrive?

933
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,160
Where have you been?

934
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,840
We just...

935
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Why is it that every time
there is danger,

936
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,720
you are not there?

937
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,360
How about this?

938
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,520
I'll think of a way

939
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,400
to control her.

940
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,720
And then

941
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
you guys...

942
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,880
Then you guys go

943
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,240
and open the gate with the key.

944
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,000
With the key.

945
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,040
All of you, stop.

946
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:34,447
(Started acting)

947
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Play what you're best at.

948
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,320
You can't outnumber me.

949
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,600
And you.

950
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,920
Why aren't you sleeping at night

951
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
but wandering around?

952
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:01,272
(Rushing to the guard)

953
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:03,826
(What happened?)

954
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
She's out of control.

955
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,040
Let's get out of here quickly.

956
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,320
(Patient out of control)
Go open the gate.

957
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,720
The patient is out of control.

958
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,680
Help!

959
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,200
Open the gate.

960
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,320
Go.

961
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,520
Go.

962
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,640
Hurry up.

963
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:36,388
(Escaped from the abandoned hospital)

964
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,440
Well done.

965
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Thank you, K.

966
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,920
Come out quickly.

967
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,360
Come out.

968
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,240
Thank you.

969
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,760
Come out,

970
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,360
you guys.

971
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,960
Thank you.

972
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,480
Thank you for the hard work.

973
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,920
Thank you all.

974
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,400
Mu Sheng, the shards?

975
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
Liu Fuyi has them.

976
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,560
Badges for the Four Bamboo Masters.

977
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,160
Badges.

978
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,520
Are there any rewards?

979
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,040
Congrats to the Four Bamboo Masters

980
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,880
on completing the treasure hunt

981
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,920
and activating the trial journey
of tomorrow.

982
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Okay, well done.

983
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,504
(Looking forward to tomorrow's journey)

984
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:23,160
(Next Episode)

985
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
We've arrived at the beach.

986
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,120
I love here.

987
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,720
Look at how cute this is.

988
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
Ling Miaomiao.

989
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,200
Miaomiao.

990
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,240
So amazing.

991
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,920
Mu Sheng caught it.

992
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Blackie is quite pitiful.

993
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,280
Liu Fuyi!

994
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
You let my chicken go.

995
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
My crabs!

996
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,200
Welcome to Island Cafe.

997
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,040
You need to be the manager for an hour.

998
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,280
As someone who has managed,

999
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,600
I will assign your tasks.

1000
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,080
You two, go make coffee.

1001
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,640
Okay.

1002
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,160
Why...

1003
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,800
There is oilpaper.

1004
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,320
I thought you could do it.

1005
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,520
You simply can't do it.

1006
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,480
I can do it.

1007
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,120
Yang Shize,

1008
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
are you making a garlic bulb?

1009
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,880
Too much is left over.

1010
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,160
By the way...

1011
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
Pay for that.

1012
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,200
How much more humiliation
do I have to suffer?

1013
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,240
Thank you so much
for liking us this much.

1014
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,080
We hope to have time
to be with you all every year.

1015
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
I hope the happiness

1016
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,440
the Four Bamboo Masters have brought you

1017
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,000
can continue into your future lives.

1018
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,440
Sheng, your eyes are red.

1019
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,640
