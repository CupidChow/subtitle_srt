00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:51,744
(The Shining Stars)

2
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,200
When fishing, it's very normal

3
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,040
that you don't catch anything
for a long time.

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
We'll catch something today, right?

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,800
I feel like a fish has bitten your bait.

6
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,160
I feel it too.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,880
A fish has bitten.

8
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,232
(Could it be today's first fish?)

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
It can't be.

10
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
There really is a fish.

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,480
A fish has been hooked.

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,960
She's caught one?

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,640
No idea. I'll...

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
I'll go there first.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,120
Go ahead.

16
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,032
(Rushing there)

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,920
Slow down.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,000
Guys, it's time to witness a miracle.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,720
What?

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Here.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
The fish is here.

22
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:45,536
(Congratulations to Esther
on catching her first fish)

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,040
That's amazing.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
A banana fish.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
Awesome.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,560
I told you I'd be the first
to catch a fish, didn't I?

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,440
Right.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,920
Esther, you caught a fish.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Right.

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
She just caught one.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,120
Really?

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,840
Yes.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
Is this a pomfret?

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,520
He says it's a banana fish.

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,800
We'll bestow upon you

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,040
the title of Fishing Expert.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,080
(Fishing Expert)
Thank you, Mu Sheng.

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm a bit hungry.

39
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:18,368
(I'm a bit hungry)

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,280
(Mission accepted)
What do you want?

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,360
How about

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
you get me a banana, please? Thank you.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,400
Okay.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,760
What food do we have?

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,032
(One small step first,
and then two small steps)

46
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:53,440
(Moving down like a caterpillar)

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
I'm really smart.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,440
When we were getting down

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,360
the mountain

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,040
in Hengdian,

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
I was like this.

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,320
We got down safely like this.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,080
Take a look.

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
So sweet.

55
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,240
(Almost eaten by the sea)

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Thank you.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
You didn't expect this, huh?

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
It's really unexpected.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,600
I thought we would
have a seafood feast today.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,200
We can have that.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
Keep going.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,400
Okay.

63
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:42,304
(Same sitting postures)

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
Did you feel the fish?

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520
You didn't even feel it.

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
That's so funny.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
This place is so beautiful.

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,680
The water is glistening.

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,440
I'm going to fish by the setting sun.

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
I haven't completed my goal yet.

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,200
With this cast, it'll be completed.

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
I need to let it touch the bottom?

73
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,400
Right.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Like this?

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Yes.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Then what?

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,080
Right, reel it in.

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes.

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
Hold it.

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,640
Don't twist it.

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
Does this one have a bait?

82
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
It doesn't?

83
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,920
It seems there is a bait.

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
Try first.

85
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:35,808
(With a hand on hip)

86
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,281
(Fish, I'll give you a chance)

87
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,656
(Bite the bait if you're sensible)

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
Fishing here now is absolutely amazing.

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Can you take a photo for me here?

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,560
Sure.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,280
You look great.

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
You look amazing.

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,800
Like this?

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,440
Yes.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
(Staff)
You can look at me.

96
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
Now take a look at the fish.

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
I got one!

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
I got one!

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,160
I got one!

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
It's so big.

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
(Staff)
Quick, take a photo for me.

102
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
(Points for the catch)
I'll take you a photo.

103
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,480
(Needing Mu Sheng's praise)
Mu Sheng, come quickly and look at me.

104
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,560
(Where is Mu Sheng?)

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,520
I feel dizzy.

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,320
Give me a break.

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,640
I feel dizzy.

108
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm starting to get seasick.

109
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,200
Mu Sheng, come catch one quickly.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
Mu Sheng, hurry up.

111
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Miaomiao, I'm coming.

112
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,800
(Staff)
Miaomiao, I'm coming.

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,040
You're throwing up?

114
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm fine.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,480
Do you want to lie down here?

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
What's wrong? Is Ryan feeling unwell?

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,360
He's not feeling well.

118
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Lie down here.

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
Lie down here.

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Feeling seasick?

121
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,840
A little.

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Do you still have the ear patch?

123
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,640
Yes.

124
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,560
He's used it.

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
(Staff)
Give him the candy from my bag.

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,280
I got another one!

127
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:21,504
(Kind reminder: loud sound ahead)

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
You caught another one?

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,880
This one's definitely caught.

130
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,840
Definitely.

131
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,160
It's a small fish.

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,600
The bucket.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,520
Just lie down to rest.

134
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
And let...

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let him...

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
I caught another one.

137
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
Another one?

138
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
Two at the same time.

139
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,200
That's awesome.

140
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
That's awesome.

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Today's food is all on me.

142
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
That many fish?

143
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,040
I have good skills.

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
You're a fishing expert.

145
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,640
Lots of fish here.

146
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,480
Is it hooked?

147
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,280
It's hooked.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,720
It got away.

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
It did?

150
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
It's hooked.

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
A red snapper.

152
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Yang Shize caught one.

153
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,040
Impressive.

154
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,720
Liu Fuyi,
have you felt the joy of fishing?

155
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
I used to fish.

156
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,640
But I didn't do sea fishing.

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,160
I did pond fishing.

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,880
What does pond fishing mean?

159
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,200
It means fishing in a fishpond.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I shouldn't be talking.

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
Right, just lie down to rest.

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Can I put this straight down?

163
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
A moment. Let me put the bait on.

164
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,720
♪Let this fragmented soul reshape♪

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,320
♪A world♪

166
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,280
Here. This one will do.

167
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,720
Throw it in.

168
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,560
I've got one.

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Then reel it in.

170
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,040
Reel in.

171
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,880
I got one.

172
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Yes.

173
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
♪Let this♪

174
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
To the bottom?

175
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,840
I think so.

176
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Reel in. Close it.

177
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
Close it. Okay.

178
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,000
It's coming.

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,760
It's a different species.

180
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,440
A licorice fish.

181
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,080
Is it one from the guide?

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
No.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,960
It's a hidden one.

184
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
We score higher
for the hidden ones, right?

185
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes.

186
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
What should I do? I need three more.

187
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,320
Got a fish?

188
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,760
Reel in.

189
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
I don't know
what the hook is snagged on.

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,480
Slowly.

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,200
The fish probably got away.

192
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
Will it eat up the bait?

193
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,600
It'll continue to eat
if you put it back.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,080
I got one.

195
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
I got another one.

196
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,160
I got another one.

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,200
So impressive.

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,840
You got a fish.

199
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,160
This one is big.

200
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
His fish is so big.

201
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,680
His fish is so big.

202
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Just so-so.

203
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,560
What?

204
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,280
That's 'all thunder and no storm'.

205
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Yeah.

206
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
So it was you.

207
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
What happened?

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,760
Your lines got tangled up,

209
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
sisters.

210
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,400
They tangled up.

211
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,040
'Sisters'?

212
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
In this lifetime, we just...

213
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
In this lifetime, we just

214
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
can't

215
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,080
get along peacefully.

216
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,280
We can't

217
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,480
get along peacefully.

218
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,800
That's fine.

219
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,200
I caught this one.

220
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
I caught this one.

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
Yours isn't reeled in yet.

222
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,120
Reel it in.
You should have caught a fish.

223
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,680
I think mine should be quite big.

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,560
Here it comes.

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,720
This is a sardine.

226
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,040
Sardine?

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,600
Sardine?

228
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,760
Sardines are very tasty.

229
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
Coach, I'll reel in my rod.

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,880
You...

231
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
You've caught another one?

232
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,040
No.

233
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm just reeling in the rod.

234
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,440
No.

235
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
Why does it feel so heavy?

236
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,440
No idea.

237
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Feels like he got one.

238
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Did I cast too far?

239
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
There's a fish.

240
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,600
He doesn't know.

241
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
I guess not.

242
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,280
A grouper.

243
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,360
A grouper.

244
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
A grouper!

245
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,200
Liu Fuyi!

246
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
You're amazing.

247
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
You're awesome, Brother Liu.

248
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
It's my favorite fish.

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
I wanted to stop.

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,680
I didn't know it was there.

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,240
Right.

252
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
Hold it. I'll take you a photo.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
Could you put on some bait for me?

254
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,120
Wait a moment.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,960
Ryan, did you catch anything?

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,560
No.

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,320
To the bottom.

258
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,840
And then you can feel it.

259
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,400
To the bottom.

260
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,360
And then reel it tight.

261
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,720
It will go 'beep, beep, beep'.

262
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
And then you'll be able to feel it.

263
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,280
Go for it.

264
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Okay.

265
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,480
I think you got a fish.

266
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,640
Really?

267
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,360
Reel in.

268
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
It's on the hook. Reel in.

269
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,520
You got a fish.

270
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,400
Yes.

271
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,880
Take a photo of him.

272
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,400
Impressive.

273
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,200
Thanks. I can keep fishing, right?

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Go for it.

275
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,800
I caught one!

276
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,840
Another one.

277
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
It's purple.

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Two at a time.

279
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,840
So we've achieved the goal.

280
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,680
These are my two?

281
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,120
Yes.

282
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
I caught two by myself?

283
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,600
Yes.

284
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,120
I caught one!

285
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Reel in slowly.

286
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,200
I caught one!

287
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,560
It should be there.

288
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,400
Here it comes.

289
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,040
It's there.

290
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
That's good.

291
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,680
We did it.

292
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Take a photo of me.

293
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
A perfect wrap-up.

294
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
A perfect wrap-up.

295
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
It's so beautiful.

296
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,400
Take a photo with your phone.

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,440
The sky is pink.

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,800
♪The sky is azure blue♪

299
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
Great, now we're heading back.

300
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
It's time to leave?

301
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,280
Congratulations
for exceeding the task goal

302
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,920
and successfully unlocking
the surprise seafood feast.

303
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,880
The seafood feast!

304
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
That's great.

305
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Here's a karaoke room.

306
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
It's been a while since I went singing.

307
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,000
How about we do this?

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,760
When coming across

309
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,040
"you", "I", and "he"...

310
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,600
Let's take a break.

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
I can't play anymore.

312
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,600
Someone's tired.

313
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
Moon Like Thoughts.

314
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
So impressive.

315
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,400
Awesome.

316
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
Let's listen to the live version.

317
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,240
There's also your name.

318
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,680
Right.

319
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,680
Join me.

320
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,640
Is there 'Gaze'?

321
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,360
Lemon?

322
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Lemon Tree.

323
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,640
There is.

324
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
It sounds good.

325
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,400
What else?

326
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Next song.

327
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,280
'Surging'. I know it.

328
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,560
I can sing this one.

329
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,720
'Surging'?

330
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
It's the latest song.

331
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,280
The list is updated to now.

332
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,480
(Miaomiao,)

333
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,000
(I've always liked you.)

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
(I've long admired you.)

335
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,880
(Yao,)

336
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
(you are the only light)

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,360
(in my life.)

338
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,400
(I hope that I,)

339
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
(the ones I love,)

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
(and the ones who love me)

341
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,000
(can all live a happy
and peaceful life.)

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,240
(Didn't we agree)

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
(to pull together)

344
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
(and unite as one)

345
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,800
(and never to part?)

346
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,400
(We.)

347
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,240
(Are.)

348
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,560
(Four.)

349
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,480
(Bamboo.)

350
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,000
(Masters!)

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,560
(We'll never part.)

352
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
(Beautiful.)

353
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
(It's a stunning view.)

354
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
Liu Fuyi, come on.

355
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Sister Mu, stand over there a bit.

356
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,320
Right, let the light shine through.

357
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
One, two, three.

358
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
Look at each other.

359
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,040
(Ryan, it's your turn.)

360
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
(Look that way.)

361
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,800
(Look what I've captured.)

362
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,120
(Beautiful.)

363
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,000
(A fairy.)

364
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,440
(Beautiful.)

365
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,400
(You look great.)

366
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,160
(So beautiful.)

367
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,160
(More photos?)

368
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
(Yes.)

369
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,200
Look. Is that a whale?

370
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,400
Look!

371
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,800
Whales!

372
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,800
Over there.

373
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,480
Over there.

374
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,600
Whale.

375
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,920
It really is a whale.
Mu Sheng, look here.

376
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,240
It's a whale!

377
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,320
Cool.

378
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
It's spouting so high.

379
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,880
We've seen a whale.

380
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,560
We're about to go ashore.

381
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,920
And we've prepared
a surprise feast for you.

382
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
Surprise feast?

383
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,440
Let's go.

384
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,640
So many delicacies.

385
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
Thank you for this.

386
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,280
Thank you.

387
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,352
(Egg yolk crisp,
Chicken jerky with banana)

388
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,472
(mantis shrimp with salt and pepper)

389
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,240
(Passion fruit garlic rib, Banana chicken)
It looks so appetizing.

390
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,520
I'm going to have a feast.

391
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,720
Is it good?

392
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
Want some soup?

393
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,680
Thank you.

394
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,880
Put it here.

395
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,600
Hot.

396
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,040
Alright.

397
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,080
This is delicious.

398
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,520
Got it, Yao?

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,320
Here.

400
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,640
Thanks.

401
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,680
How will Brother Liu eat it?

402
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:08,440
(Memories suddenly hit me)

403
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,360
Want to do it again?

404
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:13,632
(Don't miss the well-known Mr. Fuyi)

405
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,072
(Watch)

406
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:17,248
(Just pretending)

407
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,800
Wanna see you
open a chicken skewer stall here.

408
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,528
(And sell chicken skewers.)

409
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,280
You could attract those tourists.

410
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,360
Do you want me

411
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,680
to endorse chicken skewers?

412
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,080
(Sincere)
Yes.

413
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,800
(Don't forget your job)
Don't forget your job.

414
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,960
I've told you.

415
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
That's your nickname.

416
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,200
Then with us...

417
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Selling chicken skewers?

418
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,440
Many delicious things.

419
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:39,400
(Authentic fried chicken skewers)

420
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,640
I, considerate Jiu, am here.

421
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,680
Hello.

422
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,200
You all spend the whole day at sea.

423
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,080
(Heartwarming value)
You've worked hard.

424
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,760
These are

425
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,680
many

426
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,560
delicacies for you.

427
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,200
Why are you so considerate?

428
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,840
I suddenly thought of a joke.

429
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,720
(Hear it out)
Let's hear it out.

430
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,280
I'll tell this joke to Yao.

431
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,640
(Back off)
Yao, do you know what do I want right now?

432
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,400
What?

433
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,640
(Seriously)
Hainan chicken rice?

434
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,200
Wrong.

435
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
I want you.

436
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,800
(I want you)
I want you.

437
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:19,898
(Super cold air is coming.)

438
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:22,592
(The temperature drops to minus 5℃,
please pay attention.)

439
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,160
I want to hit him.

440
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,200
(You guys eat)
We are eating it.

441
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,920
I am leaving.

442
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,080
Okay, thank you, Jiu.

443
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,600
Bye.

444
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,160
Bye.

445
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,800
So cute.

446
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,920
I'll do it.

447
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,760
I can do it.

448
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,400
Thank you.

449
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,600
It's okay.

450
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
You just want her.

451
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,616
(Laugh at him)

452
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
Do you think fishing is fun?

453
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,520
Yes.

454
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,400
I think...

455
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
People who catch something find it fun.

456
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,720
Right.

457
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,960
For those who catch nothing,

458
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:52,960
not fun.

459
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,280
Right.

460
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,680
What a day today.

461
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Do you remember
you have a guardian mission today?

462
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

463
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,520
Yes.

464
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
Guess who I am guarding.

465
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,080
It must be me.

466
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,520
And?

467
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Me, right?

468
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,520
It can't be me.

469
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,920
It can't be me.

470
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,248
(Glare at him)

471
00:22:15,956 --> 00:22:17,184
(Withdrawal what I said)

472
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,000
Sheng wants to hit me.

473
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,984
(Don't do so next time)

474
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,840
Sheng should be guarding me.

475
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:25,824
(I already feel it)

476
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,080
Why?

477
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Because...

478
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,960
Because I guess this

479
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,200
by...

480
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,640
by the rules of it.

481
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
We are four.

482
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,120
I can infer

483
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,040
from it.

484
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,000
We are four.

485
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,640
You should count the production team in.

486
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:41,792
(You are good at it)

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,720
Okay.

488
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Please announce

489
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,000
the one you guard today

490
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
and put a shell bracelet on him/her.

491
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
Let's see who I am guarding today.

492
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,080
I think Yao is guarding is me and...

493
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,600
Me and...

494
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,560
Mu Sheng.

495
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,240
(Confident)
Then it must be me.

496
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,960
Why?

497
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,528
(Want to kiss, Brother Liu?)

498
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,480
Mind your words.

499
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
(Stop hurting)

500
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,320
I can tell,

501
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,360
no time for new gags.

502
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,680
(Old gags)
Right, still some old gags.

503
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,160
Old gags.

504
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,040
Why do you think

505
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,920
I take care of you?

506
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,280
You...

507
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Okay, you go ahead.

508
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,920
Do two of them
want the same color scheme

509
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,320
or a different color scheme?

510
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,000
Two?

511
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,800
(Think it over)
Right, I guard two people.

512
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,416
(Stretch out hands)

513
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
Come on, Liu Fuyi.

514
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
Come on, Liu Fuyi.

515
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,600
See?

516
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,080
See?

517
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,920
Just show you.

518
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,480
(You don't have any.)
No way.

519
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,816
(Why don't I have one?)

520
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,680
(Snatching)
A crab bracelet.

521
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,232
(I am the clown)

522
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,120
(I guarded Sheng and Miaomiao today.)

523
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,496
Thank you, sister.

524
00:23:58,496 --> 00:23:59,520
Thank you, sister.

525
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,512
(Upset)

526
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,480
So, I'm the only victim.

527
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,640
I'm so pitiful.

528
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,480
You're not being guarded,

529
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,920
not a victim.

530
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
We don't guard you.

531
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,800
It doesn't matter.

532
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,720
Are we

533
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
(All with one voice)
harming you?

534
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,400
I have a giving personality.

535
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,600
(We didn't tell it)
No.

536
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,120
To tell the truth,

537
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,360
today it's like

538
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,160
we are guarding each other.

539
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,200
Because Miaomiao
is good at taking care of people.

540
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,320
And she took
pretty good care of me today.

541
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,680
(Moments of Guardian)
You really are a very good travel companion.

542
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,600
Really? Thank you.

543
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
You're simply

544
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
the director of publicity.

545
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Right, don't rush.

546
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,360
I

547
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,400
took care of Sheng

548
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,320
by words.

549
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
(Moments of Guardian)
You lie down.

550
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,400
Feeling seasick?

551
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,120
A little bit.

552
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
Do you have that ear patch?

553
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,320
Right here.

554
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,264
(So heart-warming)

555
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,560
And then,

556
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,400
Liu Fuyi.

557
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,720
It can't be me.

558
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,808
(Jealous)

559
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,080
It's you.

560
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,400
He guards...

561
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
Why would he guard me?

562
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:07,200
(Hostile)

563
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,000
I could guess

564
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,480
Liu Fuyi must be guarding me.

565
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,880
Do you have to sway
like that when you walk?

566
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,360
Like on a fashion show runway.

567
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:26,624
(Aggrieved)

568
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,120
Stop it.

569
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,880
You should just

570
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,960
clasp with both hands.

571
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,720
Hands are oily.

572
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,400
I'll put it on for you.

573
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,360
Thank you.

574
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,840
How did you guard me today?

575
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,280
To pass you a glass of water,

576
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,040
and to wipe your sweat with a tissue.

577
00:25:58,388 --> 00:25:59,040
(Moments of Guardian)

578
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,880
Here.

579
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,600
Water here.

580
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,280
Let me help you.

581
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
What else?

582
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,280
To pretend to be nice to Ryan,

583
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
to make them think I'm protecting Ryan.

584
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,360
So it's all pretend.

585
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,680
Oh my, you...

586
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,520
(Can't coax him)
No.

587
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,960
Well,

588
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,480
but regarding this,

589
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,760
I didn't really do an outstanding job.

590
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
Because I was sincere

591
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,160
to help Ryan.

592
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,320
(Do you think I would believe it?)
You are playing both sides of the fence.

593
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,360
You're quite the talker.

594
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,440
Quite a peacemaker.

595
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
(Heartbreaking)
Oh my.

596
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,640
Why is he so scheming?

597
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,560
Really.

598
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
Eat your shrimp.

599
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
Ryan should say who he guards.

600
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
The person I guard...

601
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,400
Isn't it obvious?

602
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,360
It can't be...

603
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,040
It can't be me.

604
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,520
I guard you, Liu Fuyi.

605
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,800
I guard you, Liu Fuyi.

606
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,800
Come on.

607
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,200
Thank you.

608
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,480
Thank you.

609
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
I really am guarding her with my hands.

610
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,840
Hand guard.

611
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
When we were on the beach
in the first part...

612
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,000
I was hit.

613
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,200
Who did it?

614
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,040
I definitely made it.

615
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,440
Good.

616
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,400
It's okay, you just lie down.

617
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,840
Let him do it.

618
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,600
So sweet.

619
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,720
Guess who I am guarding.

620
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,080
If Miaomiao also doesn't guard me,

621
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
I am the most pitiable.

622
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,360
How many does Miaomiao guard?

623
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,000
Sorry.

624
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,840
I guard two.

625
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,120
Are you full?

626
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Wait, you can leave after I announce it.

627
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,440
Okay.

628
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Who do you think I guard?

629
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,400
Who?

630
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,880
Me and Sister.

631
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
It can't be Liu Fuyi and me?

632
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,080
No way.

633
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,760
I want to use my hands
full of crab roe and love.

634
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,800
Me and Liu Fuyi?

635
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,120
Both belong to them.

636
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,760
Both belong to them.

637
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,000
You put it on for me.

638
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
Princess.

639
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,160
Come on.

640
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,320
Don't stop him.

641
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,040
See if he leaves.

642
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,120
Jealous. Envious.

643
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,640
Well...

644
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
Listen.

645
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Listen to me.

646
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
But I did not guard

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,960
Liu Fuyi.

648
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,960
I only guarded Sister.

649
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,440
I shot

650
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,920
that blockbuster with both of them,

651
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,760
and took care of you,

652
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,840
carried you to get the water.

653
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,760
Come on, I'll carry you.

654
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,200
Come on.

655
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Take it.

656
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,320
Let's go.

657
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,240
Make the vibe.

658
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,640
A perfect match.

659
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
A perfect match.

660
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
Sister Mu Yao, look at him.

661
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,720
Okay.

662
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
This is their problem.

663
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,040
I feel that I'm not...

664
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,800
Not your decision?

665
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,880
Of course not.

666
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
It's decided by that

667
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
apple rabbit yesterday.

668
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,360
Right.

669
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,680
Your guardian mission today
is based on yesterday's

670
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,120
apple rabbit game.

671
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,440
The angel you are guarding is the one

672
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,520
with most apple rabbits.

673
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,720
Mu Sheng and Miaomiao get two each.

674
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,360
Yao gets four.

675
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,440
Sheng gets four.

676
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,200
Miaomiao gets four.

677
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,320
Liu and Mu Yao,

678
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,400
each get one more piece.

679
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,160
All to Miaomiao.

680
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,120
I gave you the two most attractive ones.

681
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,480
Then the two were divided equally.

682
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,680
I only give them to Miaomiao.

683
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,480
All to me?

684
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm so touched.

685
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,960
It makes me seem heartless.

686
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,400
No.

687
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,640
I know why you would

688
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,360
guard them.

689
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,680
Because I'm worry-free.

690
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,360
And you would worry about them.

691
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,560
I have two reasons.

692
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,720
I will

693
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,520
divide these apple rabbits

694
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,040
to Sheng and Miaomiao.

695
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,680
Then, it's four pieces per person.

696
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,240
So I think,

697
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,000
if I got none,

698
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Liu can't eat too.

699
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,680
It's a rather novel perspective.

700
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,360
Nice.

701
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,920
Each person's

702
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,960
dimension of thought is different.

703
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,440
Right, and they are still

704
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,560
growing,

705
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,520
should eat more fruits.

706
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,480
Okay.

707
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,760
Thank you.

708
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,000
Thank you.

709
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,880
I'm still growing.

710
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,520
And you?

711
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,480
The world-renowned Fuyi.

712
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Here's what I think.

713
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
Based on the characters in the drama.

714
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
Miaomiao, Sheng, get two pieces each.

715
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,840
Yao gets four pieces.

716
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,080
Of course,
if Yao has Liu Fuyi in her heart,

717
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,320
she would give two back

718
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,120
to me.

719
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,040
It's reasonable.

720
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,360
But...

721
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,080
We seem

722
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,360
to be quite supportive of each other.

723
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,040
That's right.

724
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,480
Right.

725
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
Let's have a toast.

726
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,360
Cheers.

727
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,920
Cheers.

728
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
Cheers.

729
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,840
First day, good luck.

730
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,440
Good luck.

731
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,440
Today, your car will be upgraded.

732
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
I dare to drive at ten miles per hour.

733
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,840
Are you good at driving?

734
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,640
Just fine.

735
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,640
Then drive.

736
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,240
You...

737
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,040
Liu Fuyi, can you drive?

738
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,120
Let me get out of the car.

739
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,680
Get out.

740
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,560
Let me get out.

741
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,640
Terrifying.

742
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,240
I don't want to ride in his car.

743
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,040
Please head to the seafood market,

744
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,960
seeking the Impostor.

745
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,080
Let's discuss the strategy.

746
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,480
I think all of us

747
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,440
target one person.

748
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,680
Have you been to Hengdian?

749
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
Are you from Guangxi?

750
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,400
You...

751
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,760
Show me your hand.

752
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,440
Take a look at your hand.

753
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
I'm the only one

754
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
who's observing?

755
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,040
Right.

756
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,560
Are we going to the secret room tonight?

757
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
Come out, Mu Sheng.

758
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,920
We are Four Bamboo Masters.

759
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
We share joys and sorrows.

760
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,080
Wait.

761
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,560
Wait, look at the ground.

762
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,760
Help!

763
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Where is Miaomiao?
