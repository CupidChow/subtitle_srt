1
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,155
Mu Sheng, come here.
There are fish here.

2
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,107
Mu Sheng, let's do this together.

3
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:38,387
Cheers.

4
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:39,699
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

5
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,427
The Shining Stars.

6
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:51,680
=The Shining Stars=

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,720
Ten.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,480
Alright.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,200
Here's a fun trivia.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,160
(Hurry and share with friends)
Banana chickens like ripe bananas.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
Let's show you

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,360
the banana chicken summoning magic.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Okay.

14
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,000
(Banana summoning?)

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Showtime.

16
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,024
(Swarming over)

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,600
That's scary, isn't it?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,800
It's so easy to catch them.

19
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:16,416
(Then give it a try)

20
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:17,280
(I'll try)

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
Here.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,960
(Food or Freedom)
Here.

23
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:21,683
(How come it's not working?)

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,520
Come in.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,760
Hurry. Come in.

26
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:26,528
(Retracting a banana)

27
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:28,544
(Only eating bananas)

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,640
Has it started?

29
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,923
(He has already started)

30
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:33,664
(Forget about it)

31
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:37,792
(Farewell)

32
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,704
(A little warm-up)

33
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,176
(Truce for a while)

34
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:44,240
(The Mu Family's clucks)

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,080
Over here.

36
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,440
(Trip around the chicken coop)

37
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,763
(The chicken coop is so big. It's hard
for the chickens not to travel.)

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,600
Now we are the chickens.

39
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,936
(Exchange of roles)

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,840
Wait, they all went there.

41
00:01:58,227 --> 00:01:59,808
(Base is attacked)

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
What should we do?

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,480
Bullying by power is too much.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Get off the table.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,480
(Just Miaomiao on the move)
Get off the table.

46
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:11,920
(Dealt with bad guys in past life
and walk chickens in this life)

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
It's like feeding pigeons
in People's Square.

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Follow me.

49
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
Here.

50
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Here.

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,400
(My Miaomiao is back)
Open the gate.

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,040
Here.

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,320
Quickly.

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,200
Let them in the gate.

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,760
Let them go home.

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
Here.

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
It flew in by itself.

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
(No rumors)
Right. Not bad.

59
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,080
Good idea.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,520
Hello. Look at this.

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Look here.

62
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:33,696
(Food for temptation dropped)

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Here.

64
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
(It'll work)
Look.

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,280
Look here.

66
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,920
It has gone in now.

67
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:41,600
(Not wanting to be at the bottom)

68
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,664
(Strike and arrest)

69
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:49,504
(Chicken crisis resolved)

70
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,792
(Chicken crisis again)

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,640
The two of us should block them.

72
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,352
(I'm here to help you)

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
(Come chase me)
You won't get away.

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes, I mean you, little chicken.

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
Little chicken.

76
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:01,971
(Searching for the next target)

77
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,168
(Caught it)

78
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,856
(The value of the first chicken)

79
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,640
You caught the biggest one.

80
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:12,544
(Thanks for the compliment)

81
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
(Awesome)
You're so good.

82
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,920
(Look at the strength of Mu Sheng
just a minute ago)

83
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,744
(Observe)

84
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,568
(Probe)

85
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,768
(Follow)

86
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,552
(Wait to make a move)

87
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:33,472
(Deploy)

88
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:34,944
(Checking in with the same pose)

89
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:40,640
(Caught the first one)

90
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,480
(Chicken catching progress: 1/4)

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,920
Should I grab its legs or wings?

92
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
(Asking for help)
Hold it down.

93
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:51,392
(Brother Liu is catching chickens.
Come and eat.)

94
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:53,088
(The unstoppable one is coming)

95
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,600
(Chicken catching progress: 0/4)

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
(The Shawshank Redemption)
It's out, Mu Sheng.

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
There is one at large.

98
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,320
(My progress bar)
It's out.

99
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
I'll catch it. Just a second.

100
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,472
(Daring to provoke Miaomiao?)

101
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:17,040
(Rearrest)

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,840
Miaomiao.

103
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Amazing.

104
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,592
(Affirmation from Miaomiao)

105
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
So impressive.

106
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,568
(Affirmation from Mu Yao too)

107
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,392
(I must also work hard)

108
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,376
(The efforts of Mu Yao)

109
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,344
(Speed: 7m/h)

110
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,920
(I've been waiting for you)

111
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,520
(Cage of love.
I cast myself into the cage.)

112
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,243
(Is this Guardian Master?)

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
You've finally been caught, haven't you?

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,840
Don't worry.

115
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,720
We will ensure you grow up healthy.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,880
But,

117
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,400
for now, we need to put you in the cage.

118
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Okay?

119
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:03,920
(Not knowing where to start)

120
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,280
I dare not take it out.

121
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
(Asking for help)
Liu Fuyi.

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Please take out the chicken for me.

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
The chicken is inside.

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
(Yao can do that?)
You covered it?

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,960
Mu Sheng did that.

126
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,040
This chicken is small.

127
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
It's Blackie.

128
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,696
(I am free)

129
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,200
(I am disappearing)

130
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,560
Slowly.

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
Blackie is quite pitiful.

132
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:25,248
(Seeing the light of day again)

133
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,440
(What's going on? Something seems off)

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,240
Yao,

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,520
I know.

136
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,040
I have vain reputation.

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,080
Nor am I the one in your mind

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,360
that you can entrust to.

139
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,600
(Not worthy of trust)

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
Liu Fuyi!

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,640
You let my chicken go.

142
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:46,688
(We meet again)

143
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:50,355
Don't come over.

144
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,136
(Escaping back to the flock)

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,320
(Miaomiao took a liking to it)
The small one.

146
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,400
That one.

147
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:58,496
(Then I have no choice)

148
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
That one.

149
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,400
The small black one on the left.

150
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,112
(Rushing to each other)

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Little sparrow. So cute.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,760
It's the one
Sheng caught for me earlier.

153
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
So impressive.

154
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,720
So impressive.

155
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,840
He caught it.

156
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,800
Mu Sheng caught it.

157
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
Little chicken.

158
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:27,859
(Chicken catching progress: 2/4)

159
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's go outside
and catch the 'banana thief'.

160
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:31,600
(Keep striving)

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
And this small one too.

162
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,496
(Miaomiao's choice of chicken)

163
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,608
(Oh, no)

164
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
Awesome.

165
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:44,128
(Chicken catching progress: 3/4)

166
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,560
Chicken-catching master.

167
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:46,592
(Here comes the chicken-catching master)

168
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll pretend to pass by it, okay?

169
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,480
Okay.

170
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
(Ultra-casual moment)
I'll pretend not to go for it.

171
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
Then, from behind it...

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Hurry.

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
(All troops deployed)

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
Mu Sheng, encircle it.

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
Here.

176
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Four chickens now.

177
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
You put it in. I'll accompany you.

178
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
Alright, all four are here.

179
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:15,200
(Chicken catching progress: 4/4)

180
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,800
So awesome.

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
Chicken-catching master.

182
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,915
(Mu Sheng's hunting is divided
into four steps.)

183
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:23,923
(Observe.)

184
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:25,811
(Track.)

185
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:28,576
(Capture.)

186
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,464
Miaomiao.

187
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,224
(He is the trustworthy one.)

188
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
Brother Liu,

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,160
(SING)
don't give up until you catch one.

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,520
I'll catch this big one.

191
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,496
(Run away quickly)

192
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,160
I'll get you some more bananas.

193
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,632
(It has to be Yao)

194
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,080
Here.

195
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,320
Throw it.

196
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,400
(What are you feeding?)

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you feeding monkeys? It's so big.

198
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,992
(Then I'll make it smaller)

199
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
They are all full.

200
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
They don't want to eat anymore.

201
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
This banana smells so good.

202
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:14,720
(The one who wants to eat is here)

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
I want to eat one too.

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
Can we eat this?

205
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes, I just had one.

206
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,040
(Taking a moment to glance at Liu Fuyi)

207
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:24,480
(Liu is trying)

208
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,592
(Supported by Yao)

209
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,000
(I'm done for)

210
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,472
(Hit with one strike)

211
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,160
Done.

212
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Okay.

213
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:42,752
(Right in front of us?)

214
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,944
(We must take it down)

215
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,472
(Danger)

216
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,424
(Begin the capture)

217
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:53,184
(I dodge)

218
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:57,248
(Spin)

219
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,152
(Jump)

220
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's collaborate and catch it.

221
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
(I'm not alone.)

222
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,800
I have you guys.

223
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
As long as we're together,

224
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
we can definitely do it.

225
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Hurry. Flank it.

226
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:14,720
(Copy that)

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Hurry. Flank it.

228
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,499
Flank it.

229
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,584
(Four Bamboo Masters's Siege)

230
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Catch it.

231
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:25,840
(Successfully captured)

232
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,560
Here, take it.

233
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Hurry.

234
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,840
(Carefully)
Hold down the legs.

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's go.

236
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Put it in.

237
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Hurry, Sister Mu.

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Each of us needs to catch one.

239
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,280
Release it.

240
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,000
(Proof of team spirit)

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Release it.

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Congratulations

243
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,920
on earning the title
of 'Heavenly Chicken Catchers'.

244
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,400
You've unlocked the beach combing set.

245
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,784
(We can go beach combing now)

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
We've arrived at the beach.

247
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,080
Happy?

248
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm ecstatic.

249
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,680
I love here.

250
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
So beautiful.

251
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Now we have prepared

252
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
the beach combing suits

253
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,960
as well as a beach combing guide.

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
(Very familiar)
Hundred Demons Mountain and Sea Map.

255
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,960
You will be divided into two teams.

256
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,640
(Miaomiao and Mu Sheng in one team)
The team that harvests more will get

257
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,480
(Mu Yao and Liu Fuyi in one team)
the title of "Heavenly Beach Combers".

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
I can't wait.

259
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,560
We need to change shoes first, right?

260
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,040
Yes.

261
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,280
Can we go?

262
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm about to set off.

263
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,880
Let's go.

264
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm off.

265
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,040
♪Can I run with all my might with you♪

266
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,800
(The sea, here we come.)
♪Towards the horizon♪

267
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,080
Little crabs, here we come.

268
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,840
I found a crab.

269
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,520
So soon?

270
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:56,880
(I haven't even warmed up yet)

271
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
(I'm catching it)
Catch it.

272
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
A crab!

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,560
Hurry.

274
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,240
Hurry.

275
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,320
It's big.

276
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:09,600
(One more crab)

277
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,800
A crab!

278
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,720
Hurry.

279
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
My luck is too good, isn't it?

280
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,960
(Big crab)
I caught a big crab right away.

281
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,520
Guys, hurry.

282
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,680
Zhu, look at the crab.

283
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,840
You caught it so quickly?

284
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,200
And it's big.

285
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
(Blessed by the sea god)
I'm so lucky.

286
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,760
Suddenly,

287
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,880
(Big crabs, where are you running to?)
I'm full of fighting spirit.

288
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,600
How about you, Mu?

289
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
Mu?

290
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,040
(Another Mu)

291
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,360
What is this?

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,592
(Rock)

293
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,928
(Beach combing)

294
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,440
(Unidentified flat object)

295
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
What is this?

296
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,760
(Answering for you)
That's chocolate.

297
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,920
Chocolate from the sea.

298
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:47,120
(Thanks. Don't answer next time.)

299
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
You're really funny.

300
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,200
Here, a piece of ginger.

301
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:50,547
(That's enough)

302
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
I've found a conch.

303
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
A conch.

304
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:00,339
Wow.

305
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,480
There are so many conchs here.

306
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,704
(A great harvest of sea conchs)

307
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,640
Well,

308
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
there isn't much big catch here.

309
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:07,560
(Wanting the big catch)

310
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,680
How big of a catch is that?

311
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,040
I like something huge.

312
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,960
Then you should jump in.

313
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
There's more inside.

314
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Mu Sheng.

315
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's do it together.

316
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Let's go.

317
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,920
What did you catch?

318
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,720
Nothing.

319
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,400
I want to catch more crabs.

320
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,160
How about you?

321
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
I want crabs too.

322
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,720
Let's go there.

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,400
Let's go.

324
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,192
(Advancing towards the crabs)

325
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,680
Crabs.

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
(In sync)
Crabs, I'm coming.

327
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,000
Nothing here at all.

328
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
Let's check there.

329
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
There are a lot of rocks.

330
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
A conch!

331
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,760
(The bar is raised)
Conchs aren't rare anymore.

332
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
It's better than nothing.

333
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,016
(Seeing it is fate)

334
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
I see a sea urchin.

335
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,064
(As expected of Miaomiao)

336
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:00,560
(No...)

337
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,480
Come quickly.

338
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,920
That's impressive.

339
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,400
There are also small fish.

340
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,360
Scoop them up.

341
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,760
Scoop.

342
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
Right.

343
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,600
Got it.

344
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
So cute.

345
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,080
(Unlocked species: sea urchin)

346
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
(Joy for some, sorrow for others)
What's wrong?

347
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,160
A sea urchin!

348
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,075
Wow.

349
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:17,747
Wow.

350
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,680
How come I didn't see any?

351
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,240
(Brimming with abundance)
There are many incredible things.

352
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,280
Let's look further down.

353
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,000
(Full of gloom)
Okay.

354
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:27,000
(What's the matter again?)

355
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,800
What happened?

356
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
What happened?

357
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,600
What happened?

358
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
An eel!

359
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
How do we catch this?

360
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,160
An eel.

361
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,200
Brother Liu.

362
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,600
What?

363
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,280
What's up?

364
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,240
I'll do it.

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,960
(I'll do it.)
I'll do it.

366
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,760
I'll do it.

367
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,920
So disgusting.

368
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,360
Hurry up.

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
It will bite you.

370
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,400
Hurry up.

371
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,360
How do we catch it?

372
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Mu Sheng.

373
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,784
You're...

374
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:55,840
(You... you...)
You... you...

375
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,560
You're really lucky today.

376
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,360
No.

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,120
I hate eels the most.

378
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,800
Hurry.

379
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
I dare not.

380
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
Do you want it?

381
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,160
I'm thinking of letting it go.

382
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,680
I can teach you how to catch it.

383
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,160
(Teacher online)
With my hands?

384
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
You have to use gloves to catch it.

385
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
Will it bite me?

386
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,600
It doesn't bite.

387
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
(Sheng's first eel-catching experience)
Pin it down.

388
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,520
Like this.

389
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,680
(I'll take my leave)
Hold it down like this.

390
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,040
Okay.

391
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,640
Yes, you need

392
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,600
to use your hands.

393
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
Don't show me.

394
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm scared.

395
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,872
(Skipping this part)

396
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,360
Okay.

397
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:26,675
(Unlocked species: sea eel)
Cool.

398
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,640
Amazing.

399
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,784
Ling Miaomiao!

400
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,891

(Mu Yao in danger)

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,480
Don't scare her.

413
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,960
You're setting it free?

414
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,760
Alright.

415
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,840
Go.

416
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
Fly away.

417
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,840
Fly away.

418
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Even if we meet again...

419
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,440
Don't get caught again.

420
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,320
Bye-bye.

421
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:35,840
(Thank you, Mu Sheng)

422
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:36,640
(Mu Yao and Liu Fuyi's catch:
several conchs)

423
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,280
They even found an eel.

424
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:39,400
(The beach combers' team
is venturing into a new area)

425
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,720
Let's take a look here.

426
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,240
Slow down.

427
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
Be careful.

428
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
Be careful.

429
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Why don't you sit there?

430
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
I can't.

431
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,880
I must find something
at such a good spot.

432
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,400
There's a little conch here.

433
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
A brown crab!

434
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,800
A brown crab!

435
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:09,040
(I must protect Miaomiao's crab)

436
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
The brown crab is inside.

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,520
Slow down.

438
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
It's too cute.

439
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Look. It's too cute.

440
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:23,360
(It's cuter if it's ours)

441
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
There's another one here.

442
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,360
(Crab-catching Expert Miaomiao's time)
A crab!

443
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,040
I caught another one.

444
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I've seen one here.

445
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
Awesome.

446
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:34,840
(Seeing a lot of crabs)

447
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,640
Miaomiao.

448
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,040
(I will also get a crab)
A crab?

449
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,680
Yes.

450
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,680
(Miaomiao has monopolized)
Crab-catching Expert.

451
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,200
(all the crabs on this beach)
Crab Overlord.

452
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,840
Liu Fuyi.

453
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,160
I want to catch crabs.

454
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,480
(Tempted by the other team's crabs)

455
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
I think I need to search properly.

456
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,440
Turn over the rocks that you can move.

457
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't bother with the ones
you can't move.

458
00:16:58,387 --> 00:16:58,600
(Doubting me?)

459
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Who are you insulting?

460
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,840
I can't turn it?

461
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
I can't turn this one?

462
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Then you give it a try.

463
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:09,088
(Even a volcano would have to move)

464
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,136
(Nothing)

465
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,160
(No comparison)
You're awesome.

466
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,320
(MVP's catch: more crabs, one more eel)
We now have both crabs and fish.

467
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,360
(No harm done)
Crabs aren't that easy to catch.

468
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,600
I thought they were all over.

469
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,152
(Besides rocks,)

470
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,776
(there are more rocks)

471
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,040
Is this all the catch we have?

472
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,040
We haven't caught any crabs yet.

473
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,320
There's nothing at all.

474
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,160
Where are the crabs exactly?

475
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Mu Sheng.

476
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:46,272
(They're all here)

477
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,560
(One's own failure is certainly scary)
What did she find again?

478
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:49,800
(But a friend's success
is even more heart-wrenching)

479
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,360
What?

480
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,800
Are you so competitive?

481
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm not competitive.

482
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm envious.

483
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,360
Some will encounter them.
Others will not.

484
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,040
Some will encounter them.
Others will not.

485
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,840
That's true.

486
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,480
Yes.

487
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,360
This way, I will have no regrets.

488
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,520
This way, I will have no regrets.

489
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,120
So happy.

490
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,840
So happy. We've found so many treasures.

491
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,600
Yes.

492
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
Tiny ones.
The smaller, the more precious.

493
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Sister Mu.

494
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,520
Have you caught anything?

495
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,120
I haven't caught any crabs. It's a pity.

496
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Let's go catch some more.

497
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,040
Let's go.

498
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,320
We, the Four Bamboo Masters,
are inseparable.

499
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,752
(Four Bamboo Masters)

500
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,200
Zhu, a crab.

501
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,800
What's wrong?

502
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,760
Hurry.

503
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:54,400
(One more crab)

504
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,400
There is a crab here.

505
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,320
(One more crab)
Catch it quickly.

506
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
There's another one.

507
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,120
It's a big crab harvest.

508
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,880
We need to team up

509
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,920
to find more things.

510
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,080
A crab!

511
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,120
Found it.

512
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,280
I finally caught a crab

513
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,680
with my own ability.

514
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,560
Let's go.

515
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
It's so fun.

516
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,920
It's too much fun.
I don't want to leave.

517
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,840
You're back.

518
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,480
It's a great harvest.

519
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,120
Happy.

520
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,400
Show us the fruits
of your beach combing today.

521
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,960
What to show?

522
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,520
Do you know?

523
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,600
As soon as I arrived,

524
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
I found the biggest and bravest crab.

525
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,440
(The first big crab)
Look how fierce it is.

526
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:36,928
Wow!

527
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:37,960
(AI version)

528
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,520
Which team do you think
should get the title

529
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,760
of "Heavenly Beach Comber"?

530
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
Each one of us is.

531
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
We are all Heavenly Beach Combers.

532
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
Congratulations to everyone
for obtaining

533
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
the title of "Heavenly Beach Comber".

534
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
The three-day island trip
is about to end.

535
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Please head to the wrap-up dinner now.

536
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,360
Let's redo it.

537
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,800
No.

538
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,360
It's okay. Just leave it like this.

539
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
It's so embarrassing.

540
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,440
Slow down.

541
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,880
Wrap-up dinner.

542
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
Super fashional.

543
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,760
So abundant.

544
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,480
Thank you.

545
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,600
You're welcome.

546
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,640
What was that?

547
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:57,952
(An act of romance)

548
00:21:58,611 --> 00:21:59,296
(Let me move it)

549
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,448
(Please make way)

550
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,360
Thank you.

551
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,480
Is this the crab we caught just now?

552
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
Miaomiao, would you like some scallops?

553
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,920
You don't love me.

554
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,520
You don't love me.

555
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,840
I said not to let me eat anymore.

556
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,880
Yet you let me anyway.

557
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,680
(Given that)
Stop me now. I'm chewing.

558
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:39,968
(Overbearing love from Mu)

559
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
Pure hate.

560
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:44,560
(Just pure fun)

561
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,440
Pure hate.

562
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,840
Four Bamboo Masters,

563
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,600
welcome to the wrap-up dinner.

564
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
Do you remember today's forecasts?

565
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,520
Yes.

566
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,600
I must have won.

567
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,640
I predicted that Mu Yao would be tipsy

568
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,400
and laughing heartily
at the chicken-catching place.

569
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,360
And she was, right?

570
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:04,520
(Definitely)

571
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,320
I predicted when Sister Mu saw me,
she would say,

572
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,200
"Miaomiao, you are pretty."

573
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,160
She didn't say that.

574
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
I predicted that Sister Mu Yao would

575
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,680
catch conchs and crabs
and start to enjoy beach combing.

576
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
I figured it out

577
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,400
through her mood and emotions
when sea fishing.

578
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,520
That's awesome.

579
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
I predicted that Brother Liu
would feel bored

580
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,520
during the beachcombing.

581
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,960
Did you?

582
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,240
(Thinking carefully)

583
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes.

584
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,320
For a moment.

585
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,680
I predicted that Mu Sheng would show

586
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,320
a wide-eyed reaction
to something anywhere today.

587
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,200
(Wide-eyed reaction)
Like now?

588
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Just like this.

589
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,920
He did it many times.
I observed it many times.

590
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,520
Next one.

591
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
When Ding was catching chickens,
he'd said, "Slow down, chickens."

592
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,520
Did you say it?

593
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,720
No.

594
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,400
When Yang Shize was beach combing...

595
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,760
Did you mention your hairstyle?

596
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,680
No.

597
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
(Wrong prediction X2)
Alright, thank you.

598
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,560
And when Shuxin was at the beach,
she'd say,

599
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,800
"I'll take a photo for you."

600
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
No.

601
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,560
(Wrong prediction X3)
No?

602
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,920
It seems that Sister Mu Yao

603
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,720
(After all, she's been kept in the dark)
doesn't understand us that well.

604
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Tipsy interaction.

605
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,000
Yang Shize would ask me
what I'd do later.

606
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,440
Did he ask today?

607
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,280
No.

608
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,000
Shuxin would say
she's going to touch up.

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,960
No.

610
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,440
Then when Ding was beach combing,

611
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
he'd say there were many seashells.

612
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,640
- No.
- No.

613
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:17,632
(In unison)

614
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
No.

615
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,920
No.

616
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,400
No.

617
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:25,152
(Right prediction: 0)

618
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,720
And Ding would wear black shoes.

619
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,400
He didn't.

620
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
He wore them when beach combing.

621
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
(Black shoes)
Really?

622
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,680
It's my turn now, right?

623
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,240
I predicted Miaomiao
would take selfies in the cafe.

624
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,600
(Selfies)
She did, right?

625
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,080
Yes.

626
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,760
Miaomiao would wear sunglasses

627
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,480
in the cafe.

628
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,960
(Wearing sunglasses)
Yes.

629
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:45,560
(Wow, that's awesome.)

630
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,680
Ding would have me
make coffee at the cafe.

631
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Yes.

632
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,840
Ding will tell a lame joke at the cafe.

633
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,720
No.

634
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,800
Yes.

635
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes?

636
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
(Here's the proof)
I shouldn't be here. I should be under a car.

637
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,040
So casually?

638
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,680
And Yao would dance in the cafe.

639
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,360
She did that.

640
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
That's right.

641
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
We even wondered why you suddenly...

642
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
You're dancing?

643
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,840
Yes.

644
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,280
Yao would try my coffee

645
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,200
at the cafe

646
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
and say it's bad.

647
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
But she didn't today.

648
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,280
She said it's good.

649
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,400
She said it's super good.

650
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
She was supportive today.

651
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,400
I didn't expect that.

652
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,240
So, I only had one wrong prediction.

653
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
That's awesome.

654
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,656
(Holding back the smile)

655
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,000
Isn't that awesome?

656
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,280
You understand us so well.

657
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,880
Right.

658
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,760
Sheng, tell us your predictions.

659
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,880
I predicted Miaomiao would take photos

660
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,440
in the cafe.

661
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,720
She would have finished as soon

662
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,440
as we entered.

663
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,120
You really know me well.

664
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,680
Right. And

665
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
as for Mu Yao,
originally I wanted to say she'd

666
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,520
no longer be tipsy.

667
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,320
But then I felt

668
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,240
it was too precise.

669
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,960
So I wrote it as

670
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,000
Yao would awaken.

671
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,040
After drinking the coffee,

672
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Mu Yao woke up.

673
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,880
And she

674
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,960
communicated
with the customers really well

675
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,000
and took orders well.

676
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,880
And then I wondered if Mu Yao

677
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,400
would call Miaomiao

678
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,360
or Shuxin

679
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,240
ten times.

680
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,760
In my memory...

681
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,920
It hasn't reached ten times.

682
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,160
Right, anyway, in my memory,
there were many times.

683
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,120
Ding has one prediction
that is quite memorable.

684
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Let him share it with everyone.

685
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,560
Okay.

686
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,640
(Choked up)
At this moment?

687
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,360
Well,

688
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,080
I predicted
that when everything was over,

689
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,160
I would miss everyone a lot.

690
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
I

691
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,080
will

692
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
miss

693
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,360
everyone

694
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,800
a lot

695
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
after

696
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,680
everything is over.

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,960
Your eyes are red.

698
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,632
♪Forgive me. I'm not good at farewells♪

699
00:27:22,144 --> 00:27:25,824
♪I never thought this day would come♪

700
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,248
♪I thought the forever you promised♪

701
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,808
♪Could battle against time♪

702
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,816
♪But the affectionate in your eyes♪

703
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,512
♪Is as fleeting as fireworks♪

704
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
So that's why I said

705
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
maybe I was born a crybaby.

706
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,488
♪But after all this time,
how can you still be♪

707
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,952
♪My Achilles' heel♪

708
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:50,752
(Ding's new song Vanishing Dialogue
has been released on all platforms)

709
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
Thank you all for the company.

710
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,640
We've customized a special cake for you.

711
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,210
(Team Spirit Challenge Completed)
Four Bamboo Masters,

712
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,600
congrats on completing the team spirit challenge.

713
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,880
Here.

714
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,840
I am truly grateful to everyone

715
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,400
for giving us a great journey.

716
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,040
And...

717
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
And I feel that they will

718
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,000
have a good life.

719
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,680
And we too.

720
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,360
And

721
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,080
I hope everyone will have a good life.

722
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,600
I think...

723
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm more of an optimist.

724
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,640
I am very grateful

725
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,360
that people like us so much.

726
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,080
And I hope

727
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,320
that in the future, we can

728
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,680
provide everyone with more good works.

729
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
I hope that next year, the year after,

730
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,120
and every year, we'll have time
to accompany everyone.

731
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,960
Thank you.

732
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,080
I'm very happy
to have met the Four Bamboo Masters.

733
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,720
And

734
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,080
I hope that in a parallel world,

735
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,120
you can be happy

736
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,760
and joyful.

737
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,480
And we, the Four Bamboo Masters

738
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,560
in the modern world,
will also have a happy life.

739
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,600
May all our wishes come true.

740
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,000
The Systems as well.

741
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,000
I hope the happiness
the Four Bamboo Masters

742
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,760
have brought you
can continue into your life.

743
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Thank you all for supporting
Love Game in Eastern Fantasy.

744
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,360
Thank you.

745
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Systems who miss us,

746
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,760
please visit us on various platforms
more often.

747
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,280
The future will continue.

748
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,520
The fireworks.

749
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,800
Are they for us?

750
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,320
