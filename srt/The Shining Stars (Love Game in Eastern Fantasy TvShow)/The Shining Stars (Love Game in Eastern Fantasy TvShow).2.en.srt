(Mission coming)

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,840
Good morning.

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,520
Hello, Esther.

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,520
Hello, this is...

9
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,280
Coming.

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,720
What is it?

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
What is this?

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,480
I received a mysterious card.

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,920
Let's see what it is about.

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,600
Welcome Four Bamboo Masters
to Weizhou Island.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Lava, waves, and tides

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,120
have created
this romantic volcanic island.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,240
Group sea outing today.

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,640
The first day in the modern world,

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
hope you all work together,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
complete all challenges,

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
and enjoy fishing, the sunset,
and food together.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,600
Both in and out of the drama,

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
no matter in which world,

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,760
I believe Four Bamboo Masters
are already bound by fate.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,440
Always guarding each other.

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,360
So today there's a

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,120
(Secret Mission: Guardian Angel)
guardian angel secret mission.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
Secret mission?

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
The person you need to guard today is...

31
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:01,320
(Confidential)

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,120
The person you need to guard today is...

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,904
(Confidential)

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,360
Of course, there will also be an angel

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,840
silently guarding you in secret.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
(Their own guardian)
Who could it be?

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,280
(And the one they need to guard)
Feel it with your heart.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,520
It's easy to guess.

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,440
(Can't deceive me. Nor me)
I find it quite simple.

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,400
Four of us.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,320
And one person will guard me.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,680
Will that be repeated?

43
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,200
(Everyone comes to pamper me.
Don't I pamper you enough?)

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
But it's not necessary.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
As your usual pattern,

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,240
it probably won't be that simple.

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,160
Today, I'll feel who is kind to me.

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
Okay, now let's set off.

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,280
Okay, so now,

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
go meet them at the beach.

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
Alright, I can't wait.

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,400
Let's go.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Beach.

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,640
Let's set off.

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
Well, right, this is a secret mission.

56
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,107
(Cautious)

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Let's go.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,840
Happy.

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
(Guard him. Guard them)
This is so beautiful.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Fishing rod.

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,640
So much fun.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Happy.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
What does this mean?

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,800
Welcome to Beihai Weizhou Island.

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
What are the four of you
feeling right now?

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
Happy.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,680
Really want to go out to sea now.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,000
The weather is fine today.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
Good, let's

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
prepare for going out to sea.

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,520
We have prepared three levels
of sea fishing packages.

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,008
(Poor package - water)

73
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:27,712
(Standard package - water, fruit)

74
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:28,320
(Deluxe package - BBQ, gourmet basket,
snacks, drinks, fishing gear)

75
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,280
We want the deluxe one.

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,280
To obtain these,

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,240
you need to challenge

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
three games
of protecting water droplets.

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,160
In each game,

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,440
the water droplets you protect

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,160
(Different scales mean different packages)
will be accumulated in the water tank.

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,880
Next, you need to

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,640
pull together.

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,480
Okay, no problem.

85
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,080
Leave it to us.

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
(Energetic Girls)
We can complete the task.

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,480
Good.

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,120
Our first game is

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,040
Water Transport in Swimming Ring.

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Water sport in swim ring?

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
Water Transport...

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,520
(Water Transport in Swimming Ring)

93
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,400
We are all slim.

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
None of us have love handles.
[*Can be called swimming ring in Chinese]

95
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,400
(You are really
a member of the Mu Family)

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Oh my.

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,960
The first game is,

98
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,888
the four of you will spin 10 rounds
together in the swimming ring,

99
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,810
then take a basin of water
from the table

100
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,160
to the water tank at the destination.

101
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,880
(Exceed the first marker)
Reach the first mark

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,760
(Unlock the Poor package)
to unlock the Poor package.

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,160
(Discussing strategy)
We will take it slow.

104
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,360
Right, don't rush.

105
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Come on.

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,080
We'll just spin ten times.

107
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,000
Spin clockwise for ten.

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
Let's try it.

109
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
How about we look at each other?

110
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
We look at each other.

111
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Come on.

112
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,680
Like this.

113
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,120
(Start timing)
One, two, three, go.

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
Wait for me.

115
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,400
So comfortable.

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,560
Seems pretty fun.

117
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,600
Like an amusement park.

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,456
(Dadada)

119
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
This is so relaxing.

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
Relaxing.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Wait, I'm feeling dizzy.

122
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,680
Really?

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Dizzy.

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,080
(Sorry)

125
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,200
Slow down.

126
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,520
How many now?

127
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
Four.

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Impossible.

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Hurry.

130
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,654
(Desire to win)

131
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Wait.

132
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Stop

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
going too fast.

134
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,720
Let Liu Fuyi lead us.

135
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
I'll just do this.

136
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,320
(Countdown: 80 seconds)

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,120
A bit dizzy.

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Me too.

139
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
A bit dizzy.

140
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,280
It's not that relaxing now.

141
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
One more circle to go.

142
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,720
Hurry up.

143
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,560
Don't rush us.

144
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,960
We have our own pace.

145
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's spin towards that bucket.

146
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,360
(Completed 10 rounds)
We've made it.

147
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,400
(Maodan flew away)
Fetch water.

148
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,160
Don't rush.

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
Scoop more.

150
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,200
Let's go.

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,440
Let's go.

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's go.

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
Take it slow.

154
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
I'd take the bucket.

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,160
Had I known...

156
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,480
Here you are.

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
(No need)
Never mind.

158
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,296
(Reach the destination)

159
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:57,413
(Staggering)

160
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,120
Okay.

161
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Come on, let me help you. Give it to me.

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Don't rush.

163
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
So heavy.

164
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Give me the bucket.

165
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:08,015
(Superwoman power)

166
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,960
(Reached the first marker)
All done.

167
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:14,498
(Poor package unlocked)

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
Moving on to the second game,

169
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,800
Jump, Water Splash.

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,936
Take turns to carry water
through rope skipping

171
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:27,296
and then pour the water into the tank.

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,416
(Second marker)
Reach the second mark

173
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,333
(Receive reward)
and unlock the reward.

174
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Be careful.

175
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,480
Be careful.

176
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,910
(Guarding anytime)

177
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm a bit scared.

178
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,480
I haven't played this in a while.

179
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
I can't either.

180
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Wait, let's start without water.

181
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
Let's try it once.

182
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,280
Let's try

183
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,920
without water.

184
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,520
Try it.

185
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
Right.

186
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,840
- He's the only one
- One,

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,160
- who dares to go.
- two, three.

188
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Wait.

189
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,640
(Back down)

190
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Can you go or not?

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
We don't need to skip, right?

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait a moment.

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
Run to the middle.

194
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
Run to the middle.

195
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,560
It's higher.

196
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
Go.

197
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
One by one.

198
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
I can do it.

199
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Be careful, go.

200
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,600
Careful.

201
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,520
Okay.

202
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Bambi Zhu.

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Coming.

204
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,768
(Jumping so high)

205
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
Yang Shize.

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
(Easy)
Okay.

207
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,800
Come on.

208
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:46,160
(Carry water)

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
(Refuse to carry water)
Don't use that term.

210
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:49,185
(Mind the words)

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Why did you get me so much?

212
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,960
As if you've never seen water.

213
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,331
(Water filled to the brim)

214
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:57,952
(For the special you)

215
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:58,920
(Take it away)

216
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,840
Coming.

217
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
Ready.

218
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,240
(Jump, Water Splash)
One.

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,000
(Round one)

220
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Two.

221
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
Three.

222
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,280
Go.

223
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:15,674
(Pass with ease)

224
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,520
I'm here.

225
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,040
Coming.

226
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,320
I got hit.

227
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
Great job.

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,320
Who did it?

229
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
Who did it?

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,464
Who let you touch her?

231
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,080
Who did it?

232
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,232
(Who hurt Miaomiao?)

233
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Who did it?

234
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
You're the front desk guy.

235
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,520
Yesterday,

236
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,480
we went along well.

237
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,040
Right?

238
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:47,960
(Overwhelming)

239
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,200
Help us keep that rope

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
in check, okay?

241
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,480
Okay.

242
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,960
Thank you.

243
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,400
We just met you today, right?

244
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,240
Take care of that rope.

245
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,960
If we catch fish,

246
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
we'll treat you to fish.

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
Alright, thank you.

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Ryan is so enthusiastic.

249
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,720
He's very skilled

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
at socializing.

251
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,440
Right.

252
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Social expert.

253
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,868
(Jump, Water Splash)

254
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:05,562
(Round two)

255
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,840
Okay.

256
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:14,712
(Effort went in vain)

257
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,200
How about we just take

258
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,280
this basin of water, okay?

259
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
Let me tell you, it's impossible.

260
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,000
So difficult.

261
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,000
(Round two challenge failed)

262
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Well,

263
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
we discuss the strategy.

264
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:28,704
(New strategy)

265
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,280
Go ahead.

266
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,280
Well,

267
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,680
let's control the two people

268
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
swinging the rope.

269
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,200
(Speaking loudly)
Control the rope here,

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
then swing it after we jump over.

271
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,600
Okay.

272
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,840
Okay, can we start now?

273
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,440
My friends.

274
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,680
Did you just discuss

275
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,040
a strategy against us?

276
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
(Caught in the act)

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,880
No.

278
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,440
How could we do so?

279
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
You're overthinking it.

280
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,400
We're not like that.

281
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,320
We need no discussion.

282
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
We are righteous

283
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
(Righteous Four Masters)
Four Bamboo Masters.

284
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,760
Ready?

285
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:54,989
(Jump, Water Splash)

286
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:55,720
(Round three)

287
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Wait.

288
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:03,856
(Take a big gulp)

289
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Keep going.

290
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:09,560
(Miaomiao, wait for me)

291
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Keep going.

292
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,400
Go, okay.

293
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Keep going.

294
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,320
Go, okay.

295
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,960
Okay.

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
Yang Shize, control him.

297
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,800
Come on, go.

298
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Wait.

299
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,680
Wait.

300
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,840
(Pretending to pass through)
Yang Shize.

301
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Come on.

302
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,160
Whose turn now?

303
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,800
You.

304
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,720
Your turn's over?

305
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,320
Right.

306
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,560
Go.

307
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,960
Okay.

308
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,800
(Challenge barely completed)

309
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,880
We all have passed.

310
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,040
We put the water in.

311
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,320
(Not yet at the second marker)
We've only reached one and a half now.

312
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,280
But if we want more,

313
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
can we

314
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
raise the stakes?

315
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
If you want to raise the stakes,

316
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
you need something new.

317
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:53,986
(Something new)

318
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,360
Alright, let's all go together.

319
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,920
Alright.

320
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,880
And if we fail, then give it up.

321
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Okay, let's try.

322
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Okay.

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Come on.

324
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:01,901
(Jump, Water Splash)

325
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,600
(Round four)

326
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,840
- Wait, you say it.
- Two.

327
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Three.

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Go.

329
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,480
Go.

330
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
Go.

331
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Go.

332
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,240
(Not moving)
Didn't we agree...?

333
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm so scared.

334
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,000
(Scared)

335
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Didn't we agree

336
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
we'd go together?

337
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
Bambi Zhu.

338
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,760
Bambi Zhu.

339
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Sorry.

340
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,480
I'll go in.

341
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
She didn't dare to.

342
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,280
Bambi Zhu.

343
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,760
Sorry.

344
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,360
I'll chase after you

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
then you splash it into that tank.

346
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
(Didn't hear anything)
I'll chase you, and you splash it.

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
(Too busy running)
Bambi Zhu, come here.

348
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,880
No, you can't touch my Sister Mu.

349
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't splash me.

350
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,320
What are you doing?

351
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,880
Bambi Zhu, don't splash me.

352
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:17,960
(This is our tacit understanding)

353
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,520
Yang Shize, don't splash me.

354
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,241
(You are clever)

355
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
So tired.

356
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:23,264
(The second marker is half complete)

357
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,920
(Confirm it again)
Well,

358
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,640
can we stand there,

359
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,000
and then we all jump three times?

360
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
No more rules.

361
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
Feels like the water is enough.

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
You might accidentally

363
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,000
(Talking at once)
tumble into that tank?

364
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,080
Right, I think we can try

365
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
going in together,

366
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,800
then you swing it.

367
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,480
That's what we meant just now.

368
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,320
But we didn't see you two.

369
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
I wanted to go.

370
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
What a pity.

371
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,240
You committed a foul just now.

372
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,400
You've failed this round.

373
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,000
How about this?

374
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
(Quick-witted)
Let me discuss with you.

375
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
(Feels awkward)
We changed the rules several times.

376
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,120
Let's do it this way.

377
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,440
Whoever gets hit fails,

378
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
and we'll pour

379
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,280
the rest in.

380
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

381
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,760
Okay?

382
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay?

383
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:03,031
(Please, please)

384
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,160
Alright, okay.

385
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,400
Good, I really like

386
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
this easy-going crew.

387
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
Come on.

388
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,040
Come on.

389
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
You are so earnest.

390
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,120
That much water?

391
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Why are you so cute?

392
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,120
I can carry it.

393
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,560
Ready?

394
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
Three, two, one, go.

395
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,360
One.

396
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,507
(Failed)

397
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
Don't spill it.

398
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
What?

399
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
Tripped over, did you?

400
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,080
Okay.

401
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
Then I'll go.

402
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
Miss Zhu.

403
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,040
Go for it.

404
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Go for it.

405
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,480
Go for it!

406
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,120
Go.

407
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
I lost.

408
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,900
(Hug)

409
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,072
(Jump, Water Splash, Friends Version)

410
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,960
Two, three, four, five.

411
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,080
Let's go, Yang Shize.

412
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,280
Why does Yang Shize jump so easily?

413
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,560
I need a camera

414
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,720
to take a shot of this tank.

415
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,240
This side is higher,

416
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,360
and this side is lower.

417
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,320
We admit this.

418
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,880
But I have something to say.

419
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,520
Go ahead.

420
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,400
You committed a foul just now.

421
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
Who? Why?

422
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,560
We didn't.

423
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,600
After Bambi failed,

424
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
the water she held doesn't count.

425
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,600
What? Bambi?

426
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
(Pouring water sneakily)
Pour me the water.

427
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,760
Tripped over, did you?

428
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,160
I need a camera.

429
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,758
(Evidence)

430
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:28,538
(Lost all strength and means)

431
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll jump five with Yang Shize.

432
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,160
Fill it up.

433
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,440
Okay, I won't scoop out the water.

434
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,200
Scoop it out?

435
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,560
It's full.

436
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,920
Don't play tricks, Yang Shize.

437
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,240
Face each other?

438
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,200
It makes us laugh.

439
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
(Make the stance first)
Closer.

440
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,200
Come on, last one.

441
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,400
(Complete five)
Done.

442
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,480
Go.

443
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,600
Cool.

444
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
It's done.

445
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:15,560
(Challenge completed)

446
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
The four of us are amazing.

447
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,408
(Standard package unlocked)

448
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,440
Next game is

449
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Four Bamboo Masters Relay.

450
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:31,296
Two groups of two. One will carry
the other who carries a basin of water.

451
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:34,368
Together, you will deliver
the water to the tank.

452
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:39,120
Reach the third mark
and unlock the final reward.

453
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,400
Then Miaomiao and Ziqi.

454
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
It's my duty.

455
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,040
You'd carry me?

456
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,000
No, you'd carry me.

457
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,080
One, two, three.

458
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Go.

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,760
Wait, I haven't got the water.

460
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,360
Has it started?

461
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,000
My friends.

462
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,368
(Start)

463
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Go.

464
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,840
Run faster.

465
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Take a break.

466
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
We can take a break.

467
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,480
Take a break.

468
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Don't get tired,

469
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,080
or we can't fish later.

470
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,960
Go.

471
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,280
It's okay, you do your thing.

472
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,640
We are all a team.

473
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,040
I'm tired.

474
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
I'll have water.

475
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,320
Hurry. Run.

476
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,680
Run.

477
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,080
Run.

478
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,960
Hurry up.

479
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
Hurry.

480
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
Why are you shaking?

481
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,432
Ryan, I'm ready. Come on.

482
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:11,849
(Esther helps Ryan save strength)

483
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,880
Are you pouring this water into it too?

484
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,640
Of course.

485
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,280
Right.

486
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,230
(Not missing a single drop)

487
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,286
(Still not enough)

488
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
Hurry. We need more.

489
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm so tired, Brother Liu.

490
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,000
Don't give up. We never give up.

491
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,520
Come on.

492
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,280
I'll carry you.

493
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
Come on.

494
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,560
(Snatches it)
Hurry, take it.

495
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,080
Let's go.

496
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,480
Let's go.

497
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,400
Come on.

498
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,080
Let's go.

499
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,360
Miaomiao, you're so steady.

500
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:19,456
(Countdown: 20 seconds)

501
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,080
It's done.

502
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,120
Your table is a bit slanted.

503
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,360
Yang Shize,

504
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,360
hurry up.

505
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,360
This side.

506
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:32,280
(Time's up)

507
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,320
We made it.

508
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,760
Our hands are off.

509
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,000
It's done.

510
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
You succeeded.

511
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:42,360
(The supporting foot)

512
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
We did it!

513
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,960
(Strolling off)
Liu Fuyi!

514
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,040
Congratulations to you
on completing the challenge

515
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,680
and obtaining all the sea fishing sets.

516
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,880
Now, we'll set out to sea immediately.

517
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,081
(Luxury set unlocked)

518
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,680
Four Bamboo Masters, today's winners!

519
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,960
Considerate Jiu is here.

520
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,800
Thank you.

521
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,560
Why didn't you come earlier?

522
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,640
Although you didn't call for me today,

523
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,160
I received a commission
from Lord System.

524
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,440
(Thoughtfulness: 33.3%)
I was afraid you might catch a cold.

525
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,920
So I specially brought you dry towels.

526
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,640
You are so great.

527
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,600
Thank you.

528
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,040
Okay, thank you.

529
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,320
Okay. He's such a sweet boy.

530
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,920
Speak out loud about your concerns
from now on.

531
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Brothers and sisters, I'm leaving.

532
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,760
Bye-bye.

533
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm off.

534
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,960
So cute.

535
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
He's so cute.

536
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,026
(Fighting against her bangs)

537
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,456
(Failed)

538
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,800
My bangs...

539
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,760
They are always like this.

540
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,840
Is there a better way?

541
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Flick to one side.

542
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
If I do that...

543
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,360
They look good now.

544
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,080
When the wind blows,
they come back again.

545
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Don't move.

546
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,520
Don't move.

547
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,360
I didn't move.

548
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,560
Is this strand of hair so stubborn?

549
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,120
Time to go out.

550
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,920
Time to go fishing.

551
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm so happy.

552
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,960
♪Through the old street

Let's go.

558
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,120
So happy.

559
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,720
No victory gesture.

560
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,080
The vibe.

561
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,960
The tempting look.

562
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,520
Three, two, one.

563
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
Beautiful sea,

564
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm here.

(Four Bamboo Masters' Sea Fishing Time)

566
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's get hooked together.

567

(Happiness overflowing the screen)

568

(Fish, I'm coming)
Let's go.

569
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
(Luxury set delivered)
Like the one I was on before.

570
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,080
Will it make us seasick?

571
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
(This is a very important question)

572
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,440
It...

573
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,880
Is better?

574
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,560
It will be, too.

575
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:38,880
It will?

576
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,760
(Oh, no)
So we must

577
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,040
take the seasickness pills.

578
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Have you all taken the pills?

579
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,080
Yes.

580
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,080
I won't take it.

581
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,920
I'll try first.

582
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,080
It's my first time fishing.

583
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,240
Well, don't be nervous.

584
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Don't let the fish hook you away.

585
00:21:51,497 --> 00:21:52,960
(Hooked away by Esther)

586
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
What's the goal for each of us?

587
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,160
(The day before)
What's your goal?

588
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,000
Seven.

589
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,240
So ten, I guess.

590
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,760
And you?

591
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,440
Four.

592
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,120
Then I...

593
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,680
Three for me.

594
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,120
Five.

595
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,160
(Five)

596
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,600
Three.

597
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:08,622
(Three)

598
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,440
Two.

599
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,128
(Two)

600
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,504
Three, I suppose.

601
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,051
(Three)

602
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:18,159
(Difficulty for all members lowered)

603
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Let's look to the right.

604
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,240
This is a fish species points guide.

605
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,160
The higher the score below the fish,

606
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,240
the greater the fishing difficulty.

607
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,440
So do we have
any performance targets to meet?

608
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,920
If the fish caught
reach ten thousand points,

609
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,360
an extra gift pack will be unlocked.

610
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,680
About grouper,

611
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,200
(Dotted grouper)
I've caught it many times.

612
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Is it easy to catch?

613
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,560
Do you know how to catch it?

614
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,040
How?

615
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,236
(The inquisitive student)

616
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,144
(Miaomiao's class starts now)

617
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:46,720
(Miaomiao's Class: How to Catch Grouper)

618
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,960
Do you know how to catch it?

619
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,280
How?

620
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,840
(Next to rocks)
You need to fish for it next to rocks.

621
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,400
So, we have to fish by the rocks.

622
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,320
Yes, because groupers
like to be near rocks.

623
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,480
(Snag)
But your hook snags easily.

624
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,560
What does 'snag' mean?

625
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,816
(Good student No. 2)

626
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,440
(Miaomiao's Second Lesson)

627
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,400
(Miaomiao's Class: What's Snagging)
It means the hook catches on the bottom.

628
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,960
(It means fishing hooks and so on)
That's when

629
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,520
(get caught on underwater obstacles,)
the fish bites...

630
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,920
(making it hard to reel in normally)

631
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,560
When it bites,

632
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,880
it'll head towards underneath

633
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,480
the rocks.

634
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,680
Making it easy to break the line?

635
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,120
Yes.

636
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,040
I also caught the snapper in Thailand.

637
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,560
I haven't caught the others.

638
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
But this is about fate.

639
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
Right, it's about luck.

640
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,680
However, some fish species
are rarer and less common.

641
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,920
(There are also hidden ones)
So the ones not on the guide

642
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
are the ultimate ones?

643
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,400
Right.

644
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm so excited.

645
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,441
(Being woken up manually)

646
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,880
Switch to manual.

647
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,035
(Employee 6f1 is connected)

648
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,080
Be calm.

649
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,800
Or I'll have to disembark
in five minutes.

650
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
Just stay calm.

651
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,320
I must stay calm.

652
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,520
It's so beautiful.

653
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,720
I'll take your photos, Esther.

654
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Shize, take it.

655
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
I have this.

656
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,320
What is it?

657
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,981
(Photography artifact)

658
00:23:57,926 --> 00:24:00,218
(Overjoyed)

659
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
No reflection.

660
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,960
No lighting.

661
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,040
It's better like this.

662
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,362
(Exclusive lighting technician)

663
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,200
You look great.

664
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,400
We're like
a professional photography studio.

665
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,040
Everyone has their own role.

666
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,168
(Four Bamboo Masters'
photography studio is established)

667
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,920
Yang Shize, come sit here.

668
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,960
The sea view this side is prettier.

669
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,720
It's glittering.

670
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,322
(Chief photographer
of Four Bamboo Masters)

671
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,320
Tilt a bit more.

672
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,965
(Action direction received)

673
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,040
Moving the camera.

674
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,640
You're making me feel dizzy.

675
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,840
Shooting a vlog?

676
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,800
Okay, got it.

677
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Next one.

678
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
Look to the side. To the side.

679
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,120
(Well-behaved)

680
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,160
I got some great photos.

681
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:54,920
Awesome.

682
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,724
(Miaomiao's photography works)

683
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:58,040
(Miaomiao's photography works)

684
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,000
Looking great.

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,800
You are really a great travel partner.

686
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,720
Really?

687
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,640
Thank you.

688
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
We've arrived at the sea fishing spot.

689
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,920
For a successful experience
for everyone,

690
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,880
we've invited a sea fishing expert

691
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,720
to help you.

692
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
(Expert)
I am your

693
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,480
sea fishing coach.

694
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,200
My last name is Li.

695
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,160
(Captain Li)
You can call me Captain Li.

696
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,840
Captain Li.

697
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,600
Hello.

698
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,480
Then let's go outside first

699
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
to collect the equipment.

700
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Alright, let's put on life jackets.

701
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,120
Okay.

702
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,400
Captain, let's go fishing.

703
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,040
Okay.

704
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,280
I will be the one filming.

705
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,440
I am familiar with this place.

706
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,400
So that's my job.

707
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:42,880
(Esther's filming)

708
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,480
So handsome.

709
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,760
They film me.

710
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,560
So I film you.

711
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,480
Is fishing always this sun-exposed?

712
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,920
Yes?

713
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
Sit here. I'll film

714
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
a short video for you.

715
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,440
Okay.

716
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,320
Let's do it.

717
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,000
Chinese women who crave good filming.

718
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,543
(Esther's filming)

719
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
It's really great.

720
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,160
(Can't stop praising)
Awesome.

721
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,000
Will you hire me
as your publicity director?

722
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,400
You're amazing.

723
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
You are simply

724
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,160
the promotion director.

725
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,040
Let's bait with shrimp now.

726
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay.

727
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,640
Well,

728
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
if there are a lot of baits,

729
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,080
(Fishing newbie is learning)
should we hook them one by one?

730
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,800
Yes.

731
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,560
But, actually, when sea fishing,

732
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,360
we don't need to fling the fishline out

733
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,320
like in the cartoons?

734
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,720
No need.

735
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,320
Off you go.

736
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,760
Let it out.

737
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,080
In the end,

738
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,440
the line will be loose.

739
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:37,320
(Nailed it)

740
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,080
If it's not loose,

741
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,240
loosen the line a bit more.

742
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,520
Okay.

743
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:39,960
Let it out.

744
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
Let it out like this again.

745
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,880
Okay.

746
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,560
You'll feel the shaking if a fish bites.

747
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:46,860
(Feeling)

748
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,707
(Waiting for a feeling)

749
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:51,867
(Handsome is a feeling)

750
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,895
(Do you feel it?)

751
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,240
Ryan, have you felt the fish?

752
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,640
(No)

753
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,040
Ryan says we're too loud

754
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,200
and scare the fish away.

755
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,600
What bait is for this fishing rod?

756
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,720
Sandworm or shrimp?

757
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
Can I have a sandworm?

758
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,840
Sure.

759
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:16,640
(Sandworms usually live on beaches
or so. They're a common bait)

760
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
I'm going over there.

761
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll catch two

762
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
to show my strength first.

763
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:21,800
(Fishing girl here)

764
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
I want to fish for groupers.

765
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,880
I really feel it's a bit sunny here.

766
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Sit here.

767
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,200
Or switch places with me.

768
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,000
You can face that way,

769
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,840
against the sun.

770
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,920
It's fine.

771
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:57,824
♪I'm gonna take this moment♪

772
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,104
♪And make it last forever♪

773
00:28:02,104 --> 00:28:05,280
♪I'm gonna give my heart away♪

774
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:09,230
♪And pray we'll stay together♪

775
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,867
♪'Cause you're the one good reason♪

776
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:16,680
♪You're the only girl that I need♪

777
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,400
Our lines got a bit tangled.

778
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,520
(There are no fish at all)
It seems like there are no fish below.

779
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,904
(Is there a kind fish
willing to take a bite?)

780
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,240
I haven't felt any fish.

781
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:46,393
(Waterloo of their fishing careers)

782
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,960
I don't want to fish here.

783
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,080
I will fish over there.

784
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,360
The boat has rolled the line all under.

785
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:53,616
(Quickly changing position)

786
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,080
(At the stern of the boat)

787
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,720
Coach, I want a fishing rod too.

788
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,560
Okay. Come on.

789
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll sit here.

790
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
(Approaching step by step)

791
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,840
No. Stay away from me.

792
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,520
Don't hook me.

793
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,600
No. Stay away from me.

794
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Don't hook me.

795
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:11,219
(Man, you're playing with fire)

796
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,976
(The love and hate with Mr. AI)

797
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:18,869
(Take this punch)

798
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,280
Are you silly?

799
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,080
(Being mischievousness)

800
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,440
No.

801
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,960
Let me

802
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
explain the principles.

803
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,760
This line needs to be hooked by hand.

804
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,640
Hook this line.

805
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Then when you release the line,

806
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,000
make sure the safety is open

807
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,760
to loosen the line.

808
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
When a fish bites,

809
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,360
the end of the fishing rod will tremble.

810
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
But mine keeps trembling.

811
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,480
Lift it up a bit.

812
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
Maybe you've caught something.

813
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,080
Is there a fish?

814
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,520
Is this the sign of a fish biting?

815
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:52,736
(He has caught something?)

816
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,760
Coach, he has caught something.

817
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,960
He has?

818
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,440
(Empty)
Nothing.

819
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,600
Pulled it up.

820
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,200
I'm shocked.

821
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
Where is Esther?

822
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,120
Miaomiao is there.

823
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,240
She is completing her goal.

824
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,760
She wants to be the first one

825
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,360
to catch

826
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,160
a fish.

827
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,179
(Miaomiao is working hard on her goal)

828
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,440
I think they won't catch anything
over there.

829
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
But I'll catch something here.

830
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,120
Okay. Done.

831
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Because their fishing lines

832
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
will be under the boat.

833
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
Okay.

834
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,720
This cast must land a big fish.

835
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
(Empty hook)
It's eaten.

836
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,520
Give it to me. I'll adjust it.

837
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,520
I must catch the fish.

838
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,680
Why isn't the fish taking the bait?

839
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,846
(Outrageous)

840
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,480
Hold it for me.

841
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,520
I'll apply more sunscreen.

842
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,456
My goodness.

843
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,600
(Nothing gained)
Esther,

844
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,760
have you caught anything?

845
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
No, I'm still trying.

846
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:14,920
(Trying)

847
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,840
Is your spot not sunny?

848
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
Should we call Ryan over?

849
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,280
I'm afraid he might get heatstroke.

850
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:23,549
(No one cares about me?)

851
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Yang Shize is fishing for me.

852
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,840
I think if he catches anything
with my rod,

853
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,880
he'll say it's his catch.

854
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,440
I must go now.

855
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,560
Caught anything?

856
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,640
Where's my rod?

857
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:36,640
(Where's my rod?)

858
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,440
You...

859
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,552
(Ten minutes ago)

860
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
(Crime scene of 'where did the fishing rod go?')
Is she coming back?

861
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,400
If not, I'll pull her rod up.

862
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,320
I can't handle both.

863
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:46,769
(My eyes are the measure)

864
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
You...

865
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,680
You haven't fished for me.

866
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:58,560
(How to respond? I need help)

867
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,720
I just pulled it up.

868
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,160
I thought you weren't coming back.

869
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,640
I was coming back.

870
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
Cast it yourself.

871
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,520
Do you know how?

872
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,600
How should I do that?

873
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,120
Where are you going?

874
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll stand here.

875
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
You'll stand?

876
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,720
No sitting?

877
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Your spot is too sunny.

878
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,040
So each of us three has a spot.

879
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,120
You can squeeze in here with me.

880
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,080
You can squeeze in here with me.

881
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,480
Let's all squeeze together.

882
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,400
Your place

883
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,840
has no enough room for me to sit.

884
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,040
Give it a try.

885
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,680
Maybe you can sit down.

886
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,800
You don't have long legs.

887
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,760
You said it yourself.

888
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:41,915
(Easily persuaded)

889
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,320
Let me make some room.

890
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,680
Isn't it too cramped here?

891
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I'll make you some room.

892
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,840
Come on. Let's squat here together.

893
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,040
I can't squat down.

894
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,120
I think my bait has been eaten.

895
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,480
The group over there
must think we're too lousy.

896
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
We haven't caught a single fish.

897
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:07,635
(It's so hard)

898
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
The fish won't bite.

899
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
They don't bite easily.

900
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,360
Isn't fishing supposed to be easy?

901
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:18,305
(Fishing in Bambi Zhu's mind)

902
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,480
What's the goal for each of us?

903
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,680
Three.

904
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,120
Five.

905
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,600
Two.

906
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,160
Three, I guess.

907
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:31,538
(Zero)

908
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,160
They must be full at this point.

909
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,760
It's not their eating time yet.

910
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,160
Could it be
that the fish here are too smart?

911
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
People fish them every day.

912
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,520
Do you think you can catch them
just by dropping the line?

913
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Yes, we've given them
so much tasty food.

914
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,000
Once the line goes down,
it should catch fish in bunches.

915
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
It should catch fish in bunches.

916
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,960
A bunch every few minutes.

917
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,080
Something like that.

918
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,080
When fishing, it's very normal

919
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,920
that you don't catch anything
for a long time.

920
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,280
We'll catch something today, right?

921
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,592
(Can't imagine that)

922
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:07,960
(The group's hope is still trying)

923
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
We can do it.

924
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,680
Keep it up.

925
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,880
I feel like

926
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,160
a fish has bitten your bait.

927
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,520
I feel it too.

928
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,240
There is one.

929
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
It can't be.

930
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,040
(Today's first catch?)

931
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,120
There really is a fish.

932
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,360
A fish has been hooked.

933
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,080
She's caught one?

934
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,760
No idea. I'll...

935
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,720
I'll go there first.

936
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:31,880
(Rushing there)

937
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,440
Slow down.

938
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Guys, it's time to witness a miracle.

939
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,240
