00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:09,163
(8:20 AM)

4
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:14,927
(Liu Fuyi wake-up service)

5
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:16,728
Mr. Yang.

6
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,648
Does your today's outfit match with me?

7
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:21,968
Hi.

8
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:22,528
Morning.

9
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:23,128
Hi.

10
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:23,768
Morning.

11
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,328
(Always online)
Does your today's outfit match with Shuxin?

12
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:29,368
I don't know.

13
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:30,328
Mr. Yang.

14
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:31,088
Does your outfit match with me?

15
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:31,808
(I am here)
I am here.

16
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,208
Look in the mirror.

17
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,747
(Check the handsome look)

18
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:36,695
(Check the existence,
Check the energy)

19
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:38,768
Have you listened to that song?

20
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:39,208
What song?

21
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,888
The one you sent me last night.

22
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,248
(Ding Yuxi)

23
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:43,808
About Zhu Xudan...

24
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:49,804
(Zhu Xudan's theme song)

25
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:51,513

27
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,608
(Stop)

28
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:01,288
I found this song very funny.

29
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,248
The one you sent me...

30
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:08,968
What's wrong?

31
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:09,968
There's no glass.

32
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,208
(600 degree shortsightedness)
I wondered

33
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,528
if they can capture our voice.

34
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:14,608
And I was doing so here.

35
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:15,448
I realized

36
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:16,448
there's no glass.

37
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,528
We can perform a mime.

38
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,448
Let us out!

39
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,088
Sister.

40
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:20,888
(Into it now)

41
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:21,568
Sister.

42
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:22,648
Don't!

43
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:24,088
Miaomiao.

44
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,848
(Come by the sound)

45
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:27,648
Miaomiao.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,573
(Your Miao is here)

47
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,688
You are here.

48
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:33,448
Miaomiao.

49
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,768
What shall we do now?

50
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,968
We must first break through the zone.

51
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,488
Do we need to cast a spell?

52
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:41,928
Come on.

53
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,448
Go for it.

54
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:44,168
No, you open the door.

55
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,048
You're the best at it.

56
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:45,448
Right.

57
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:53,614
(The well-known Mr. Fuyi)

58
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,261
(Mr. Door)

59
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:00,568
Spitting blood.

60
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,568
(An essential part)
Brother Liu.

61
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,368
Didn't we promise to save my sister?

62
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,288
(My ears hurt)
Brother Liu.

63
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,168
Are you okay?

64
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,088
Help me get over there.

65
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:09,688
(Needs rest)

66
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,648
Okay.

67
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,648
Over there?

68
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,967
(Pull left and right)

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,728
Wait.

70
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,888
In the drama, we left you

71
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:17,928
and the three of us went by ourselves.

72
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:20,448
(I'm redundant)
Do you need to do so?

73
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:22,568
Alright, this way.

74
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,328
Let's go.

75
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,088
Take a nice position.

76
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,568
Hurry.

77
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:29,168
(Mission announcement)

78
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,568
Today is the second day
of your trip together.

79
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,848
During today's trip,

80
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:35,448
you'll go through
several tests of team spirit.

81
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:36,008
(Wow)

82
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,248
There are two games

83
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:38,808
that need you to finish together.

84
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,048
If you succeed,

85
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,808
today, your car will be upgraded.

86
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:43,768
Self-driving.

87
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:46,098
(A self-driving car as a reward
for completing the mission)

88
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:47,768
You just got your driver's license.

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,704

(Motor vehicle driver's license)
Motor vehicle driver's license.

92
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:56,848
It's my driver's license.

93
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:58,968
I can drive now.

94
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:03,244
(What is this? Can someone tell me?)

95
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,488
I only dare to drive
at ten miles per hour.

96
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,688
Walking might even be faster.

97
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:09,168
Are you experienced in driving?

98
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,088
(Curious)

99
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:10,808
Just fine.

100
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:11,528
How many years?

101
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:12,488
Don't ask.

102
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,528
The first game.

103
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,648
(Game - Sing A Song For You)
Sing A Song For You.

104
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,688
We will give you the singing theme.

105
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,528
And each of you must sing
a song related to the theme.

106
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:25,768
Four of you singing a round
is considered as success.

107
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,008
Brother Liu, is it okay
for you to sit here?

108
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,488
I want to see your face.

109
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,008
I want to see your face.

110
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:34,688
(Stand up suddenly)
I'll confirm it.

111
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,048
The ones in the middle
have to sing twice, right?

112
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:36,408
Yes.

113
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,967

114
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:40,768

What did you say?

374
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:54,248
I didn't make a sound.

375
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:58,968

Three, two, one.

376

How about this?

540
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:17,528

554
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,048
Recently, it’s been windy
and sunny at sea.

555
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,168
What should we do
if hair easily becomes dry and frizzy?

556
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,888
It's okay, Sister Mu.
I have a good solution.

557
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:46,968
Would you like

00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,288
You're welcome.
Go ahead and wash your hair first.

562
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:09,168
It's instantly absorbed
when you apply it.

563
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:11,288
It feels like the hair
has absorbed all the nutrients.

564
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:14,048
The hair quality has improved instantly.

565
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,208
It looks really smooth.

566
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:21,848
And it smells great too.

567
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,128
I know a magic trick.

568
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,288
Shall I perform it for you?

569
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:29,128
Look here, Sister Mu.

570
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:31,728
Isn't it very bouncy?

571
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,368
Going to the seafood market.

572
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:43,768
Come on.

573
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:44,848
Come on.

574
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,608
I should sit behind Liu Fuyi.

575
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,568
This is an automatic transmission car.

576
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,608
You learned C1.

577
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:51,888
Right.

578
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:52,768
(C2 driver's license owner)
C1.

579
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:54,944
(C2 easy job)

580
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,848
Seat belt.

581
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,288
Seat belt.

582
00:19:58,288 --> 00:19:59,208
This is...

583
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,208
(Copy and paste)
You need to fasten it.

584
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,088
From the front.

585
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,088
I just found out
that Liu Fuyi usually...

586
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:06,528
Let's go.

587
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,088
So there is a camera here.

588
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:12,968
(Shuxin has her own camera)
We are now setting off to the seafood market.

589
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,928
(Departure)

590
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:19,728
Let's go.

591
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:21,368
Let's go.

592
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,208
Let's go.

593
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,408
Start driving.

594
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,008
Let's go.

595
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:26,328
(Body is driving)
You're just saying...

596
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:28,263
(Probe)

597
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:30,968
Liu Fuyi, can you drive?

598
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:31,968
Can you drive or not?

599
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:32,968
Let me get off.

600
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:33,568
Get off.

601
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:34,408
(Save Mu Family's siblings)
Let me get off.

602
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,448
Liu Fuyi can't drive.

603
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:37,248
Why this...

604
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:39,888
So terrifying, I don't want to be here.

605
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:42,648
Help!

606
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:44,128
He can't drive.

607
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:44,968
I can drive.

608
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,168
So terrifying.

609
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:47,808
(Man-machine needs to load)
Make the steering wheel down.

610
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:48,888
Can't shift gears, right?

611
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:49,408
Right.

612
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,728
(I've learned this in driving school)
Step on the brake all the way.

613
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:51,248
Shift gears.

614
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,048
I've stepped on it.

615
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:52,768
Have you released the handbrake?

616
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:53,168
I might walk there.

617
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,048
It's released.

618
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:55,568
Turn the key further
towards the bottom right corner.

619
00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:56,448
I'll take that car.

620
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,208
Is that car okay?

621
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,528
(It's on)

622
00:20:58,528 --> 00:20:59,488
You didn't.

623
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:01,968
He didn't turn it on.

624
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,008
Can you drive or not?

625
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,528
Isn't Sister Mu driving?

626
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:05,968
Let's go.

627
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:06,768
(This time we're really setting off)
Let's go.

628
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:08,248
Let's go.

629
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:09,728
Let's go.

630
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:14,008
You can drive slower.

631
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,448
So handsome, Brother Liu.

632
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:16,328
Finally.

633
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:17,248
Slower, Brother Liu.

634
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:18,608
(Heading to Imperial Capital)
To Imperial Capital.

635
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:21,168
Do we make that expression?

636
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:22,048
Okay.

637
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,648
Come on, one, two, three.

638
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:28,768
(Cute)
Look at me.

639
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
How about it?

640
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Every time I board a plane,
I just crawl in.

641
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,408
Crawl in like this?

642
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,328
Crawl under the airplane blanket
and play games.

643
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,408
(Miaomiao House)

644
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:39,488
I'll take a picture of you.

645
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,448
So cute.

646
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:41,968
Come on, let me take a picture of you.

647
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,568
It's okay.

648
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,008
So cute.

649
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:48,688
So cute.

650
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,128
Ding, let's take the picture together.

651
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:50,648
You get that.

652
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:52,168
Get closer to Shuxin.

653
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:53,968
There's not a single gap.

654
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:56,128
Looks good.

655
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:57,128
Take a look.

656
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:59,128
(Not sure about the result)
Does it really look good?

657
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,248
(Trust me)
What?

658
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:00,968
Let me see.

659
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:01,848
Look for yourself.

660
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:03,928
Swipe that way.

661
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:05,728
Not bad.

662
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:06,528
This is good.

663
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,488
What to do? I have a filter.

664
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:09,368
You are just cute.

665
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,328
(She loves it)

666
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:10,968
Not bad.

667
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,088
Not bad.

668
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:12,448
Not bad.

669
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,808
(Looking for praise)
Is this okay?

670
00:22:13,808 --> 00:22:14,128
(Approval)
Not bad.

671
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:14,608
Okay.

672
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:16,488
(She is satisfied)

673
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,408
The pictures you took in one day
yesterday is a year's worth for me.

674
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:18,888
Do you know?

675
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:19,728
(Photo studio is open)

676
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:20,328
How nice!

677
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:21,968
This habit of yours...

678
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,208
(Everyone's good friend)
It's easy to make friends.

679
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,008
Right.

680
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:27,208
Everyone is willing to play with you.

681
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:31,608
The sea.

682
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,208
These are all fishing boats.

683
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,608
We can go up and fish directly.

684
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,168
(What a fishing girl)

685
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:48,488
They're looking for crabs.

686
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:51,408
I want to get off the car.

687
00:22:51,408 --> 00:22:52,728
(Hiring a translator)
I want to go find crabs.

688
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:55,248
Get out of the car.
I'm going to catch crabs.

689
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,408
(Ready to help)
I'll open the door.

690
00:22:58,328 --> 00:22:59,768
(Just kidding)
This reef is a lot of fun.

691
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,368
PD, remember this place.

692
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:02,168
We have to play here.

693
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,528
This place is so much fun.

694
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:06,848
Really. Look,
they catch fish over there,

695
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,088
and they process it here.

696
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:13,504
(One-stop service)

697
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,328
Why aren't we there yet?

698
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,008
Is this it?

699
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:18,208
(Beihai City Weizhou Island South Bay
Seafood Market)

700
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,328
I think so.

701
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:25,408
Shall we get off?

702
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:26,168
Let's go.

703
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:26,608
Let's go.

704
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,352
(Thoughtfully holding the door)

705
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,368
(So happy)
Guys.

706
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:38,768
Are we going to go to the beach?

707
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:42,656
(What is this about?)

708
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:44,488
No, it can't open.

709
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:46,928
(Two minutes ago)
Try harder, do it again.

710
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,800
(Sister is trapped, needs help)

711
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:58,784
(Here comes Sheng)

712
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,224
(Open the window)

713
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:02,368
(Open it from both sides)

714
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,328
(Get the door)
It's okay now.

715
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,728
(Sister got charmed)

716
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:06,808
Amazing.

717
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:10,240
(Once done, just leave.)

718
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,408
So beautiful.

719
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:17,688
So beautiful.

720
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:21,208
Are there crabs under this?

721
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:29,648
Where is my phone?

722
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:31,688
With the one who touched up your makeup.

723
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,048
Why didn't you give it to me?

724
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,688
(Can't fit in my pants)
I took out my phone to take pictures.

725
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,296
(Here)

726
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,568
(I'll fulfill every one of your wishes)

727
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:43,307
(Go ahead)

728
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,088
Photoshop it in later.

729
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,832
(Enough, you two)

730
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:54,608
No.

731
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,568
It's under the rock, isn't it?

732
00:24:58,448 --> 00:24:59,448
Can't see it.

733
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:00,488
(No crabs)
No.

734
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,008
Okay.

735
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,408
Welcome to Weizhou Island.

736
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:05,528
(Weizhou Island)

737
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:08,408
Weizhou Island is rich in products,

738
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,408
with dozens of seafood

739
00:25:10,648 --> 00:25:12,328
and unique marine products.

740
00:25:14,808 --> 00:25:18,048
A visit to Weizhou Island
is incomplete without a seafood feast.

741
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:20,888
Whether you can
have a seafood feast today

742
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:24,008
depends on if you can win the game.

743
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:25,120
(A big bite)

744
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:27,528
(Seek the impostor)
Seek the impostor.

745
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,408
At the seafood market,

746
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,288
among the five stall owners,

747
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,768
you have to find the impostor.

748
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:34,928
Each stall owner has an oyster,

749
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:37,048
and only the oyster
in the impersonator's hands

750
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:38,568
contains a bamboo ornament.

751
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:42,088
(Bamboo ornament)
When you find it, you can open the oyster to verify authenticity.

752
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,008
Okay.

753
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,408
I think...

754
00:25:46,408 --> 00:25:46,968
Go ahead.

755
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,288
Let's discuss the strategy.

756
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,408
I think we need to surround one person
with four people

757
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:54,528
(One: Outnumber the target)
and catch them off guard.

758
00:25:54,528 --> 00:25:56,048
When we meet someone,

759
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:58,088
we need to ask the people next to them

760
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:58,848
if they know them

761
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,048
(Two: Ask the one next to them)
or if they recognize them.

762
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:01,528
Because if each of them...

763
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:03,008
If they are always here,

764
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:05,048
they should know each other very well.

765
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:06,008
(Approving)

766
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:08,808
(Three: Observe to lock the target)
We can go in and observe to see who looks more suspicious.

767
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:09,048
Okay.

768
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:09,448
Okay.

769
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:10,048
Let's go.

770
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,000
(Full of confidence)

771
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,288
Be careful.

772
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,088
The seafood market.

773
00:26:18,528 --> 00:26:19,888
They look fresh.

774
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,408
They look really delicious.

775
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:22,248
The big lobsters.

776
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:23,328
(Thank you)

777
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,328
You can buy whatever
you want to eat here.

778
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:29,288
It's so beautiful,
the sunset over there.

779
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:31,208
(The sunset outside the seafood market)

780
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,128
So beautiful.

781
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,128
(Time's up. The task matters more)

782
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,808
Hello, everyone.

783
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:36,888
(Observing while greeting)
Hello.

784
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,128
Hello, there.

785
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,152
(Locked the target)

786
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,488
How old is she?

787
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:47,264
(Starts asking)

788
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:48,448
(You can guess)

789
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,008
(Trying another question)
What's her name?

790
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,208
Shanshan.

791
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,608
(Making a pursuit)
How long have you been working here?

792
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:57,568
(Answering fluently)
More than a year.

793
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:58,928
Where are you from?

794
00:26:58,928 --> 00:26:59,808
We're locals.

795
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:00,568
Locals?

796
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:01,208
From the island.

797
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:07,888
Alright, we won't make it hard for you.

798
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:09,128
Thank you, miss.

799
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:11,408
(Looking back at her)

800
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:12,888
Why is she wearing a watch?

801
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,088
(He's noticed her watch)

802
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,048
They don't wear watches

803
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:15,928
when doing such work.

804
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,088
Because watches may get wet.

805
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:19,208
(Suspecting her to be the impostor)

806
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,288
Ding,

807
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,568
we aren't in the impostor's

808
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:22,488
stall area yet.

809
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,320
(Wisdom comes early)

810
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:25,920
(Suspicion comes early)

811
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,168
(The greeting gift
for Four Bamboo Masters)

812
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:28,288
(A small misunderstanding)
Hello.

813
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,968
Take a look. What do you want?

814
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:32,808
(Being curious)
What is this?

815
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,288
Banded shrimp.

816
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:35,728
Mantis shrimp.

817
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:36,648
They have roe.

818
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,688
They have roe.

819
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,488
(It's basic)
They have roe.

820
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:41,328
(You are so pretty)
You are so pretty.

821
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,168
(Heehee)
Thank you.

822
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,048
What would you like?

823
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:45,168
Cuties.

824
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:46,488
Take a look.

825
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:48,808
Sea cucumbers?

826
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,048
They're sea cucumbers?

827
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,288
(Big sea cucumbers of Weizhou Island)
Yes, from Weizhou Island.

828
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:53,208
They're a specialty of our island.

829
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,368
(It's new to me)
It's my first ti...

830
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,008
(Take it)
Can I touch them?

831
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,768
(It's okay)
You can try.

832
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,472
(Copy and paste)

833
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:02,968
(I'll make your visit worth it)

834
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:03,648
It's alive.

835
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:05,968
(Poking)
So soft.

836
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:07,288
Actually, I love eating these.

837
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,688
Only I'm trying to see
who looks more suspicious?

838
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,168
(impostor, you have nowhere to run)

839
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:11,488
(Run from here)
Right.

840
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:16,128
(The impostor's area. Stall owners)

841
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,968
(Stall owners)

842
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:25,968
There are two here.

843
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:28,328
And more here.

844
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:30,912
(Stall owners)

845
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:33,648
We can go in and observe to see

846
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,048
who looks more suspicious.

847
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,096
(Judging by their looks)

848
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,768
(Trying to ask)
Where are you from?

849
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:50,176
(Avoiding eye contact)

850
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,448
(Trying to ask again)
Where are you from?

851
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:54,888
This is my hometown.
Where would I come from?

852
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:55,688
(Taking up things unconsciously)

853
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:56,768
You're from Guangxi?

854
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:57,968
Yes, Guangxi.

855
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:01,152
(Putting them back)

856
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,032
(The smart guy)

857
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:05,968
I'll take a photo with him.
See if he has a mic.

858
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:08,448
(Trying to verify
by where he's wearing a watch)

859
00:29:10,088 --> 00:29:12,928
It's okay. Let's take a photo.

860
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,048
(Go behind them)

861
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:14,784
(He's wearing a mic)

862
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,640
(Checking on the others)

863
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:23,520
(They're all wearing a mic)

864
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:24,608
No.

865
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,288
(Verification failed)
They all have mics.

866
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,584
(It can't be confirmed
by whether they're wearing a mic)

867
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:31,888
(Is there some other way?)

868
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:33,528
May I take a look at your shoes?

869
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:34,272
(Observing what they wear)

870
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,288
My shoes?

871
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:39,008
(AI)
AI...

872
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:39,968
(AI)
AI?

873
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,728
(Cute panda flops)
Although they're not flip flops...

874
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,328
(Very Guangxi style)
Flip flops.

875
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:46,928
(AI, not flip flops)
AI Brother Liu.

876
00:29:46,928 --> 00:29:47,712
(It's a misunderstanding)

877
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,488
(Stall owners)

878
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,208
Excuse me.
May I take a look at your shoes?

879
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,464
(Observing other stall owners' shoes)

880
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:56,736
(Staring)

881
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,160
(Rain boots)

882
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:02,088
Thank you.

883
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,008
(Checking No. 2's shoes)
Sir, may I see your shoes?

884
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:06,496
(No. 2: flip flops)

885
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,208
Ma'am, may I take a look at your shoes?

886
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:08,888
What do you need?

887
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:09,768
Shoes. May I see them?

888
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,488
Crabs?

889
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:11,048
(Crabs?)
Shoes.

890
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:11,848
(A customer?)
Crabs?

891
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:12,368
Shoes.

892
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:12,648
Crabs?

893
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:14,408
(The shoes)
The shoes you're wearing.

894
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:15,488
Shoes.

895
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:15,968
Crabs?

896
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:17,648
The shoes.

897
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:18,768
Shoes.

898
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:19,688
Your shoes.

899
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,344
(Thank you)

900
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,128
Sir, may I see your shoes?

901
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:24,000
(Checking the last stall owner's shoes)

902
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:26,080
(Rain boots)

903
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,104
(Nothing wrong with shoes)

904
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,056
(Taking another look)

905
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,680
(All-around scanning)

906
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:48,008
(Nothing can escape the AI's sharp eyes)
I know who it is now.

907
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:49,128
(So fast?)
Who?

908
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:49,608
Who?

909
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:54,272
(There is)

910
00:30:54,323 --> 00:30:55,648
(Only one truth)

911
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,048
Why?

912
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:01,208
(Crease marks on the apron)
His apron has crease marks.

913
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,168
It's new.

914
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,048
(Stop pretending. Just confess)
Right?

915
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:10,728
(I'll confess)
But hers has crease marks too.

916
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:11,616
(This one's too)

917
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:16,448
This one here too.

918
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:17,664
(More?)

919
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:19,088
(Why do they all have crease marks?)
That's true.

920
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:21,024
(AI's hawk-eye system failed)

921
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:25,768
When is the fishing ban period?

922
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:27,288
It starts on May 1st.

923
00:31:27,288 --> 00:31:27,968
May 1st?

924
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:29,248
On May 1st,

925
00:31:29,248 --> 00:31:32,248
(Knowing fishing policy very well)
the sea is closed off at twelve o'clock.

926
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,288
The fishing ban period starts at twelve.

927
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:40,896
(Heehee)

928
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,688
Ask the one next to them
if they know them

929
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:47,048
or if they recognize them.

930
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:49,288
What's his name?

931
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,488
His name is Yong.

932
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,328
What's her name?

933
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:54,448
What's her name?

934
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:55,520
(Turning head)

935
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:57,408
(Got something?)

936
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,968
What's her name?

937
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:00,768
(Fangfang)
Fangfang.

938
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:02,528
Fangfang.

939
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:03,616
(Hesitating)

940
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:07,968
Is she the belle of your market here?

941
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,008
She's the prettiest of South Bay.

942
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:11,688
(The prettiest of South Bay)
The prettiest of South Bay?

943
00:32:16,888 --> 00:32:18,488
Have you been to Hengdian?

944
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,088
Hengdian?

945
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:19,928
No.

946
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:21,448
Really?

947
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:23,648
Really?

948
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:24,448
Yes.

949
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,648
(First question)
Are you from Guangxi?

950
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:27,448
Yes.

951
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:28,568
(Second question)
Which part of Guangxi?

952
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,888
Yulin.

953
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:31,448
(Third question)
Then why did you come here?

954
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:34,328
Because my parents sell seafood here.

955
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:38,400
(Fluent and logical answers)

956
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:45,208
And the lady wearing the hat.

957
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,648
(Approaching No. 1)

958
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:48,808
Hello.

959
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:50,488
Hello.

960
00:32:51,768 --> 00:32:52,688
(Take the initiative)
What do you want?

961
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,608
Take a look.

962
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,192
(Holding the sea cucumber
with her hands)

963
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:02,088
She must be a local.

964
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,808
She just handed a sea cucumber

965
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:04,768
to me directly.

966
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:06,688
You can touch them.

967
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:07,448
It's okay.

968
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:08,368
You can touch them.

969
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:09,128
It's okay.

970
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:12,928
What's the season for sea cucumbers?

971
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,952
(Asking a professional question)

972
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,408
They're available

973
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:16,128
at any time.

974
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:16,888
At any time?

975
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:18,808
They're only unavailable
when the current

976
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:19,808
isn't right

977
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:20,288
at the sea.

978
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:28,168
I know. Let's ask that lady

979
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:29,288
about their names.

980
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
Ma'am, what's her name?

981
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,158
(Confirming the identities
of other stall owners)

982
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,104
(through the most credible No. 1)

983
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:36,320
(Clever Miaomiao)

984
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,368
What's her name?

985
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:39,248
(Consistent with No. 2's answer)
Fangfang.

986
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,848
(Making the pursuit)
Then what is the first man's name?

987
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:43,248
His name is Niu.

988
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:44,408
(Niu)
Niu.

989
00:33:44,408 --> 00:33:45,208
And him?

990
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:50,016
(Not knowing the name)

991
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,048
He smiled
when I took his photo just now.

992
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,848
We found him.

993
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,456
(Is he the impostor?)

994
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:05,288
Is it you?

995
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,088
What?

996
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:08,704
(Denying it)

997
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,008
So, what's your original profession?

998
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,608
I won't know.

999
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:15,888
I don't know what to do.

1000
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,128
You don't know what?

1001
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,208
Your profession?

1002
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:21,448
I sell seafood.

1003
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:22,888
I've sold seafood for many years.

1004
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:23,888
I don't mean today.

1005
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,088
I mean your profession before.

1006
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,168
I started doing this
right after finishing school.

1007
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,568
Don't ask anymore. It's him.

1008
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:35,608
That lady doesn't know him.

1009
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:36,968
Let's ask someone further away

1010
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:38,208
about his name.

1011
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:41,728
What's his name?

1012
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:44,576
(Not knowing the name)

1013
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:47,528
Twelve.

1014
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:50,248
(Twelve?)
Twelve.

1015
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:51,808
She's lying.

1016
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:57,008
She doesn't even know his name.

1017
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:00,688
Look, they're all laughing.

1018
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:01,528
Something is off.

1019
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,048
It's you.

1020
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:06,568
She doesn't even know his name.

1021
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:08,328
Yes, we've guessed it.

1022
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,288
Open it.

1023
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:21,928
So skilled?

1024
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:23,648
I've been doing this for many years.

1025
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,848
I've been doing this for many years.

1026
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,248
Nothing.

1027
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,688
(No bamboo ornament)

1028
00:35:41,688 --> 00:35:44,128
I don't have any pearls.

1029
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,611
(The first speculation is wrong)

1030
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:58,928
Nothing.

1031
00:35:58,928 --> 00:35:59,568
Nothing at all.

1032
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:00,808
Nothing.

1033
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:01,448
Nothing at all.

1034
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:05,528
I see.

1035
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:07,808
If they've been doing this
for a long time...

1036
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:11,128
You. Please let me see your hands.

1037
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:15,088
(Hands exposed to seawater)

1038
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,368
You. Please let me see your hands.

1039
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:19,368
We would like to see your hands, okay?

1040
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:20,800
(No. 2's hands)

1041
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:24,888
Let's take a look at your hands.

1042
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:28,008
(No. 3's hands)

1043
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,328
Let's take a look at your hands.

1044
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:33,152
(No. 5's hands)

1045
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:34,168
It's him.

1046
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:35,048
It's him.

1047
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:37,047
(It's still him after everything)

1048
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:38,448
Why is that?

1049
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,688
Because others' hands
are pale and swollen.

1050
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:41,448
Take a look.

1051
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,808
(No. 4's hands)
His hands are pale.

1052
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:44,288
(No. 1's hands)
And that lady's hands are pale.

1053
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:44,888
His are pale.

1054
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:46,008
(All the stall owners' hands)
His hands are also pale.

1055
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,424
(Only his hands are not pale)

1056
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,448
It's definitely him.

1057
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,608
Which part of Hengdian are you from?

1058
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,928
I'm a local to Guangxi.

1059
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:55,688
(Pure Guangxi accent)

1060
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:58,248
Listen to me. They might have found

1061
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:00,808
a local extra from Guangxi.

1062
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:02,648
That's why he speaks with that accent.

1063
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,664
(That makes sense)

1064
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:06,488
I personally feel

1065
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,768
that if judged by the hands,
it's definitely him.

1066
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,968
(Is he the real impostor?)

1067
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:11,928
Open it quickly.

1068
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:20,128
If judged by the hands,
it's definitely him.

1069
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:27,728
Nothing.

1070
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,608
(No smiling)

1071
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:30,408
Nothing.

1072
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,176
(Painful look)

1073
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,528
I think it's this lady.

1074
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:41,928
She's been smiling all the time.

1075
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:51,168
No.

1076
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:51,888
It's you.

1077
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:52,408
It's him.

1078
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:53,448
No. It's you.

1079
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:54,248
It's him.

1080
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:55,968
(Miaomiao and Mu Sheng
both think it's No. 2)

1081
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:56,992
(One minute ago)

1082
00:37:57,824 --> 00:37:59,680
(Noticed the business license)

1083
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,488
What do you call him?

1084
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:06,168
Yong.

1085
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,368
The stall owner is Wei.

1086
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:10,808
The stall owner is Wei.

1087
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:17,298
(Such an obvious mistake?)

1088
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:19,328
Hurry up and open the oyster.

1089
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:21,088
Open what?

1090
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:21,888
Open the oyster.

1091
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:25,608
His oyster is not even by his side.

1092
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,328
(Miaomiao's eyes are the measure)
Look. He needs help to open the oyster.

1093
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:42,448
We got fooled.

1094
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,328
He looks like the smartest one.

1095
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,128
We got fooled.

1096
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:49,343
(Will the third choice
be the right one?)

1097
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,848
(The bamboo ornament)
There it is. The bamboo.

1098
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:02,168
(Congrats to the Four Bamboo Masters
for successfully finding the impostor)

1099
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:04,448
It's him.

1100
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:13,928
Why are your hands so pale?

1101
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:16,568
I've already been in this market
for four days.

1102
00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:18,408
Sir, you were originally...

1103
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:19,888
I've always been an actor.

1104
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:22,208
I knew I saw him in a drama...

1105
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,848
I studied performance direction.

1106
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:28,368
(Li Zhiyong, an actor)
I've always been an actor.

1107
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,488
I studied performance direction.

1108
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:32,368
I've already been in this market

1109
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:33,168
for four days.

1110
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:34,648
I've arrived.

1111
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:37,888
Since I have to play a fisherman
and fishmonger,

1112
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,368
I must act like a fishmonger.

1113
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:40,368
(Getting dressed like a fisherman)
Come on. Time to work.

1114
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,048
I've never sold fish before.

1115
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,888
I need to adopt the habits

1116
00:39:44,888 --> 00:39:46,128
of a fishmonger

1117
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,608
(Blending in with the fishermen)
and blend in with the others.

1118
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,728
Where should I start cutting it?

1119
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:53,448
(Learning knowledge of the seafood)
From the back, right?

1120
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:54,648
Cut it open and then...

1121
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:56,768
Hold it like this?

1122
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:58,408
(Learning how to hold the seafood)
Right?

1123
00:39:58,408 --> 00:39:59,168
Just like this.

1124
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:00,288
Now, let's catch a lobster.

1125
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:03,608
It's so hard to catch.

1126
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:05,608
A fishmonger's day begins.

1127
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:06,648
This shrimp is tasty.

1128
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:07,168
(Learning to talk to the customers)
Some more.

1129
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:08,968
It's full of meat.

1130
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:10,848
(Score of 100 for the disguising skills)

1131
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,168
You do this to get into the role.

1132
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:13,448
Yes.

1133
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:17,248
Welcome you to Guangxi.

1134
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,008
Come to visit Guangxi more
in the future.

1135
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:19,968
We will.

1136
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,288
Actually, many people don't know

1137
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,528
about this place, where you can

1138
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,368
watch whales and go sea fishing.

1139
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,648
And the seafood market here
is so good, right?

1140
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:27,488
And it's suitable

1141
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:29,648
for self-driving tours
and riding e-scooters.

1142
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:31,048
The ecology is well preserved.

1143
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:33,408
Yes, so the quality
of the seafood here is also very high.

1144
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:34,008
Right.

1145
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:37,568
People say humans and nature
are integrated.

1146
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,368
If humanity is tolerant towards nature,

1147
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:42,208
nature will also be tolerant
towards humanity.

1148
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:43,328
Okay.

1149
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:44,808
Thank you.

1150
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:45,288
Alright.

1151
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:46,008
Alright.

1152
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:47,048
Thank you all.

1153
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:47,888
Bye-bye.

1154
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:48,928
Wish you success.

1155
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:50,688
Well done. Bye-bye.

1156
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,648
You performed really well.

1157
00:40:53,488 --> 00:40:54,128
Bye-bye.

1158
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:55,408
Welcome back next time.

1159
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,000
(Congrats to Four Bamboo Masters
on unlocking the seafood feast)

1160
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:10,688
(Jing Ye Seaview Restaurant)

1161
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,160
This place is really good.

1162
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,600
Come on. Let me take photos.

1163
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,240
(Not failing the good view)

1164
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,360
Photos of life.

1165
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,560
Let me take them.

1166
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,600
One, two, three.

1167
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:26,720
Wow.

1168
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,360
You look great.

1169
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,160
Come on.

1170
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,600
One, two, three.

1171
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
Let me take some for you.

1172
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,332
(Let Sister Mu spoil you)

1173
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,600
(I'm a photographer now)
Not bad.

1174
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,280
A life photo.

1175
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
(Sister Mu pressed the shutter button)
A life photo.

1176
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:45,728
(The photography world is paused.
See you next time)

1177
00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:48,360
(From novice to shutdown)

1178
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm sorry.

1179
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,760
I can...

1180
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,640
I can do this.

1181
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,280
She shut it down.

1182
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,800
Yes, she did.

1183
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,440
I can do this.

1184
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,840
(Let's do it again)
You look great.

1185
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Absolutely cool.

1186
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,360
Cheers.

1187
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:16,384
(Not one of the Four Bamboo Masters
can be missing)

1188
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,920
The dishes are here.

1189
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,960
Thank you.

1190
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,160
Avocado and prawn salad.

1191
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,360
Let's eat.

1192
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,040
Let's start.

1193
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:36,271
(Already eating)

1194
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,160
The avocado is good.

1195
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:40,544
(Having another big bite)

1196
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,920
The honeydew melon is good too.

1197
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,600
Brother Liu,

1198
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,360
eat a steamed bun.

1199
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,704
(Pure enjoyment: emojis)

(Eating a bun: Mu Sheng's version)

1201
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,720
The sea urchin.

1202
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,000
Is it cooked or raw?

1203
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,720
With steamed eggs?

1204
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,360
Yes.

1205
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:06,848
(Gulping)

1206
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,320
It's tasty.

1207
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,360
There is a hint of seafood's sweetness.

1208
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,120
That's right.

1209
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,840
You need Cooking Master Boy's music.

(Always answering to Miaomiao)

1211
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:28,064
(Loading music)

1212
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,480
There is a hint of seafood's sweetness.

1213
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,320
Sweetness.

1214
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,480
Please.

1215
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
Who wants to do food commercials?

1216
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,280
Go to Ding.

1217
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,960
He can't hold back anymore.

1218
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,080
He wants to act.

(Calling for loving sponsors
from the center of the universe)

1220
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,120
I just realized

1221
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,480
they're so considerate.

1222
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,800
They've made apple rabbits.

1223
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,040
They have made us feel

1224
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,600
that apples naturally look this way.

1225
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,840
Is this part just about relaxing
and having food?

1226
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,680
Isn't it good?

1227
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,960
It's the calm before the storm.

1228
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,760
(Loading variety show system...)
I agree.

1229
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,360
Are we going to the secret room tonight?

1230
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:15,552
(Don't worry. I'm here)

1231
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,320
Tonight?

1232
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,400
It'll be terrifying.

1233
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,240
It's okay during the day.

1234
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
At night, it's scary.

1235
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,640
Are you afraid of escape rooms?

1236
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
I find them a bit scary.

1237
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,040
I find them a bit scary.

1238
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:27,136
(Just a bit?)

1239
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,120
I find them a bit scary.

1240
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,912
(Just a huge bit)

1241
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,760
So are you bold?

1242
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,720
You're not that bold either.

1243
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,080
(It's over)
So who's being the tank today?

1244
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,720
Sister Mu.

1245
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,640
(Sister Mu)

1246
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,360
I...

1247
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,040
You can't?

1248
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,000
(I'll be scared too)
I can't.

1249
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,760
You can tell him

1250
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,120
to get out of your head.

1251
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,640
It must be very funny.

1252
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,960
But seriously,

1253
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,880
who'll be the first one?

1254
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,640
The first one is...

1255
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,040
The first one is, of course, Xingbao.

1256
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,600
(The promises Shuxin made)
How about this?

1257
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,240
(Not caring about Yixu at all)
If it's more than 30,000,

1258
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,680
we'll play the escape room

1259
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,920
with Wang Yixu being the first.

1260
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,640
Is Xingbao here?

1261
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,440
(Will Xingbao come?)
I don't know.

1262
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,680
He will come, right?

1263
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,280
But if the first one isn't Xingbao,

1264
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,040
we really need to choose someone else.

1265
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,320
The first one is crucial.

1266
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,400
Then let's decide

1267
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,880
(Fighting for the first spot)
the order of us

1268
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,840
through a competitive game, okay?

1269
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,600
(Please withdraw that suggestion)
No, I really can't be the first one.

1270
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,280
How about this?

1271
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,000
The first one will be from the two boys.

1272
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,560
Alright?

1273
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:19,840
Okay.

1274
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,960
We girls won't participate.

1275
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,480
Okay.

1276
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,040
Okay.

1277
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:22,875
(You guys are awesome)

1278
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,760
Hurry.

1279
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,200
You guys...

1280
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,040
I know.

1281
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,880
Let's play the game
of holding back laughter.

1282
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,080
Whoever laughs first will...

1283
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,160
Look at each other.

1284
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,600
Good.

1285
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,760
(Four Bamboo Masters' No Laughing Game)
Let's not look at each other first.

1286
00:45:33,152 --> 00:45:34,769
(Can't hold it in already)

1287
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,120
I don't think it's necessary.

1288
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:38,440
(The audience thinks it's necessary)

1289
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,720
Don't appear in my sight.

1290
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,520
We won't talk.

1291
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,880
What does it have to do with me?

1292
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,638
(Because...)

1293
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,640
(Then let's look from afar)

1294
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,120
Come on.

1295
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,880
Three, two, one. Go.

1296
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,424
(Four Bamboo Masters' No Laughing Game)

1297
00:46:04,192 --> 00:46:06,127
(Miss)

1298
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,120
Did you open your eyes?

1299
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:11,520
(He opened)

1300
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,440
(Missing out is a kind of privity)
Did you?

1301
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,320
I did.

1302
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,272
(I'll wait for you)

1303
00:46:22,272 --> 00:46:23,104
(Missed again)

1304
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:25,760
(Sheng,)

1305
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,680
(how about a competition?)

1306
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,136
(Brother Liu loses)

1307
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:41,792
(Embarrassed)

1308
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,760
You've lost.

1309
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,440
You go first.

1310
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,120
(She's so just that she's almost evil)
You've lost.

1311
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,760
You go first.

1312
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,320
You've lost.

1313
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,320
Alright, I've lost.

1314
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:48,896
(Won first place for the escape room)

1315
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,400
It's fun.

1316
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,160
Do you want to try?

1317
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,600
I want to play the game with you.

1318
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:54,640
Okay.

1319
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,200
Come on.

1320
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,080
(No Laughing Game: No Punishment)
One.

1321
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,920
Two.

1322
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:00,600
Go.

1323
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,720
I have a low threshold for laughter.

1324
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,320
It's hard to judge who wins
and who loses.

1325
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,680
Isn't it quite fun anyway?

1326
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,560
Let's us two do it.

1327
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:28,448
(Preparing to amuse all)

1328
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,360
I can infect others with laughter.

1329
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,232
(I know)

1330
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,520
One, two, three. Go.

1331
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,440
(From now on,)

1332
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,016
I'll call you Ziqi,
and you can call me Miaomiao.

1333
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:55,168
♪Even if I encounter storms
and crash into flames♪

1334
00:47:55,168 --> 00:47:58,720
♪Even if the thorns cover me♪

00:47:59,072 --> 00:48:01,692
♪I was meant to♪

1336
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:05,888
♪Embrace every surging wave♪

1337
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,040
Why are your lips trembling?

1338
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:18,272
(Tried to hold it in until it hurts)

1339
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,480
It's okay to look away?

1340
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,640
(Who exactly is in your heart?)
Why are you looking at Liu Fuyi?

1341
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,720
(I didn't mean to stroll
into your story)

1342
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,640
What does that mean?

1343
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,120
It's okay to look at others?

1344
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,640
She looked at Liu Fuyi and laughed.

1345
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,320
You didn't say we can't look at others.

1346
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,600
Liu Fuyi is the first.

1347
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,520
Liu Fuyi is the first.

1348
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,880
Liu Fuyi is the first.

1349
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,680
They were competing.

1350
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,720
Then she glanced at me.

1351
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,600
So she laughed.

1352
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:47,680
(Sister Mu is in charge of justice)

1353
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,280
(Continuing to amuse all)
Liu Fuyi, let's do it.

1354
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,040
Do we need to?

1355
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,640
We laughed like crazy
when they filmed it.

1356
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,600
(Never mind. Let's battle)
One, two, three. Go.

1357
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,624
(Eye attack)

1358
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,520
I can't see you.

1359
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,240
(Cross-eyed. Break)

1360
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,080
I can't see you.

1361
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,160
Are you cross-eyed?

1362
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,080
I'm cross-eyed too.

1363
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,000
(A pair of stooges)
No one can see each other.

1364
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,520
We didn't see each other.

1365
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,920
Our visions were blurred.

1366
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,520
We couldn't see each other.

1367
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,720
It's so heart-wrenching
when you look at each other.

1368
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,480
So,

1369
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,000
the first one.

1370
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,480
The second one.

1371
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,280
The third one and the fourth one.

1372
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,920
Okay.

1373
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:27,744
(Loading a memory)

1374
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,720
The first one is, of course, Xingbao.

1375
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,400
(Loading complete)
No.

1376
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,200
The second one.

1377
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,520
The third, the fourth,
and the fifth ones.

1378
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,920
(The best spot for the best Xingbao)

1379
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,280
Then let's welcome

1380
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,200
Yixu to come down from the aerial rig.

1381
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,640
Really?

1382
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,928
(I'm spoiling you for the last time)

1383
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,280
How could it be?

1384
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,760
(Provoking)
I think he must be too timid to come.

1385
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,680
I am here.

1386
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,560
(Wang Yixu, executive producer)
Hello.

1387
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,480
Hello.

1388
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,560
Let's welcome Xingbao.

1389
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,280
(Shy Xingbao)
Didn't expect such a grand entrance.

1390
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,400
Jiu.

1391
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,920
I'm here.

1392
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,680
Brothers and sisters,

1393
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,400
I heard you are going treasure hunting.

1394
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,600
I've sent someone

1395
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,040
to wait for you
at the treasure hunting spot.

1396
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,640
Okay.

1397
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,480
Have you sent one person

1398
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,400
or five ghosts?

1399
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,520
(I am Jiu, who brings warmth)

1400
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,800
You also have a secret code
for making contact.

1401
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,440
What is it?

1402
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Take it well.

1403
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:33,200
(There's a secret code.
Fuyi has received it)

1404
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,080
Wishing you a smooth treasure hunt.

1405
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1406
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,400
I'm leaving now.

1407
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,240
Don't forget to think of me,
the considerate one.

1408
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,080
Bye-bye.

1409
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,760
Jiu.

1410
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,400
Jiu.

1411
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:43,920
Bye-bye.

1412
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,240
(Human services on line)
Can you communicate?

1413
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:45,720
Yes.

1414
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,640
In the beach comb,

1415
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,640
did you find anything?

1416
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,880
I didn't find anything.

1417
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,360
Alright then.

1418
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:54,840
Thank you,

1419
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,360
Jiu.

1420
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:55,720
Thank you.

1421
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,520
It's okay. We'll help you tomorrow.

1422
00:50:57,824 --> 00:50:58,680
(Thank you, brother)
Off you go, Jiu.

1423
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,440
Bye-bye.

1424
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,280
Thank you, Jiu.

1425
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
We agreed that when reaching 30,000,

1426
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,960
we hope that Yixu could join us

1427
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,240
in the escape room game.

1428
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,880
(It's time to fulfill the promise)
I knew everyone loved him.

1429
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,240
So I wanted to motivate everyone.

1430
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,960
I didn't expect everyone
to love us so much.

1431
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,160
(Miaomiao has received all the love)
Then there are the Systems.

1432
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,640
You helped us break 30,000.

1433
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,400
So I discussed with Yixu

1434
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,640
that we must accomplish this

1435
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,280
to show our respect for all the Systems.

1436
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,040
(Thank you, Systems)
Great.

1437
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,160
Great.

1438
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,040
You kept the promise.

1439
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,240
(Focused on the mission)
What's our secret code?

1440
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,960
Our secret code is...

1441
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
This can be read, right?

1442
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,320
Take a bite of the apple rabbit.

1443
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,880
Mu and Yi fry chicken strips.

1444
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,160
I think this might be

1445
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,000
some key clue to the escape room.

1446
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,480
Take a bite of the apple rabbit.

1447
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,960
(How will the secret code work?)
Mu and Yi fry chicken strips.

1448
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,120
Alright, let's set off then.

1449
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:49,392
Let's go.

1450
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:55,264
(All members seated)

1451
00:51:57,712 --> 00:51:59,712
It turns out
that Wang Yixu is protected.

1452
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:00,672
Look, he is detained.

1453
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:05,184
(Hahaha)

1454
00:52:05,672 --> 00:52:06,792
I want to take him a photo.

1455
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:10,472
Detained.

1456
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:11,272
That's true.

1457
00:52:12,792 --> 00:52:15,072
How many people are there
in this one continent?

1458
00:52:16,152 --> 00:52:17,672
Is there an endorsement deal?

1459
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:19,632
Endorse seafood.

1460
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:20,552
Banana chicken.

1461
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:21,672
Let Liu Fuyi do it.

1462
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:23,992
Fry chicken strips here.

1463
00:52:25,472 --> 00:52:26,392
(Liu Fuyi's fried chicken strips)
They'll be even better.

1464
00:52:28,032 --> 00:52:30,432
We are about to reach our destination.

1465
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:31,672
We'll be there.

1466
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:33,152
(A bit excited)
Please put on your blindfolds.

1467
00:52:36,192 --> 00:52:37,072
The blindfolds?

1468
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:40,256
(Record can be checked)

1469
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:41,992
Please put on your blindfolds.

1470
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:48,472
We are getting off the bus.

1471
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:49,408
(Ah)

1472
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:51,424
(Mu Sheng.)

1473
00:52:51,507 --> 00:52:51,872
(Yes?)

1474
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:52,672
(Protect me.)

1475
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:53,440
(Okay.)

1476
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,040
(Liu Fuyi.)

1477
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:56,352
(I'm not here.)

1478
00:52:56,352 --> 00:52:57,998
(Protect us all.)

1479
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,195
(Did you hear me?)

1480
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,946
(I can hardly protect myself.)

1481
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:09,032
I'm here.

1482
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:10,312
Okay, Yixu is here to lead us.

1483
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,272
One person.

1484
00:53:11,672 --> 00:53:12,272
(Tentatively)
You lead me.

1485
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,232
And I will lead Zhu.

1486
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:13,752
Okay.

1487
00:53:13,752 --> 00:53:14,192
Zhu.

1488
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,112
Come on.

1489
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:15,912
I am here.

1490
00:53:16,408 --> 00:53:17,536
(Fumbling)

1491
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:18,592
Let me help you.

1492
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,272
Don't bump into anything.

1493
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:21,432
Both of you be careful.

1494
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:22,192
Yang Shize.

1495
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:23,112
Come on.

1496
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:24,552
Come on.

1497
00:53:24,552 --> 00:53:25,072
Okay.

1498
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:28,432
(Moving slowly)

1499
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:28,992
So dizzy.

1500
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:32,272
Who will be in the...

1501
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:34,432
The first one is Xingbao.

1502
00:53:34,432 --> 00:53:35,592
The second one is Liu Fuyi.

1503
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:36,552
This is Liu Fuyi.

1504
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:37,872
Then it's Zhu.

1505
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:38,352
Zhu.

1506
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:39,832
And I'm behind Miaomiao.

1507
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:41,872
(Looking for Miaomiao)
Where is Miaomiao?

1508
00:53:41,872 --> 00:53:42,952
Sheng, I'm here.

1509
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:43,352
Sheng.

1510
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:43,912
(Miaomiao and Sheng)
Miaomiao.

1511
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:45,072
Protect me, Sheng.

1512
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:47,112
Who is

1513
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:48,192
the second... third one?

1514
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:48,552
(It's Yao)
Me.

1515
00:53:48,552 --> 00:53:49,952
Okay.

1516
00:53:49,952 --> 00:53:50,512
Let's go.

1517
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:52,032
Follow me and move forward.

1518
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:55,192
I'm scared.

1525
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:08,712
You're off-key.

1526
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,832
Don't be afraid.

1527
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:11,152
Wait.

1528
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:11,672
Yao,

1529
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:13,432
ease up a bit.

1530
00:54:13,432 --> 00:54:14,392
Your hands

1531
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:15,752
make my trapezius muscle hurt.

1532
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,672
Trapezius muscle.

1533
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:18,552
Fifty meters.

1534
00:54:18,913 --> 00:54:20,378
(Approaching the destination)

1535
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,432
I want to go home.

1536
00:54:22,432 --> 00:54:23,232
What about you?

1537
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,552
Keep going.

1538
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:26,472
Keep going.

1539
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,432
Twenty meters to go.

1540
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,992
I want to go home now.

1541
00:54:28,992 --> 00:54:30,152
Go home.

1542
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:33,112
Ten meters.

1543
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,352
We have about three meters to go.

1544
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:37,712
Shall we leave?

1545
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:38,632
It's close now.

1546
00:54:42,464 --> 00:54:45,152
