1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,160
I feel like I had a very long, long dream.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,800
We will never be apart.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,160
But I feel

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,440
that all of this

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,880
is not a dream.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,440
Is this my first stop?

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,680
Through the ancient street behind the alley

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
The Qin opera breeze makes me feel the sunset

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,040
So beautiful

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,200
Feels like it could be the setting for many great movies

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,320
Which kitten is the most well-behaved

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Meow meow, I am Miaomiao

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,640
I am Miaomiao

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,040
The Bookstore on the Cliff

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,640
So beautiful

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,840
Welcome to "Shining Stars"

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,080
The ocean

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,360
Watching the sunset alone

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,360
feels like something is missing

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,280
If the three of them were here right now

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
that would be great

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Going to the sea

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,720
So many beautiful shells

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
There are such big shells here.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
I am so lucky today.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
I found so many shells.

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,120
What is that?

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
System.

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,680
You are the system.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,320
The panda boundary marker can serve as a system carrier.

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,600
But it is not the system itself.

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,960
System, how did you come here?

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,200
How did you come to the modern world, system?

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,920
Was it you who sent the mosquito to bite me, system?

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,200
Because the host's target's favorability reached 100%.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,760
And saved the monster-catching world.

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,880
The system decided to fulfill the host's wish.

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Arranged a special journey for the four heroes.

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,000
The system channel is now open.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,520
Please summon on your own, host.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
No problem.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,760
Summon the buddies.

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Where is it?

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
The summoning progress is zero percent.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Please use the summoning technique.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
Summon the Three Heroes of the Bamboo Forest.

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,560
I understand.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,720
I need to shape this shell.

49
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,960
This way, my friends will come out.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Did you see that?

51
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,200
Our slogan is love and peace.

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,000
The current summoning progress is twenty percent.

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,880
Only twenty percent? What should I do next?

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
Should I jump into the sea?

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Friends,

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,960
come out quickly.

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,320
Summoning the Four Heroes of the Bamboo Forest.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Summoning progress is at forty percent.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Forty percent.

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,640
Next, let's try another method.

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Summoning ritual.

62
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,920
Why aren't you here yet?

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,120
Summon my little buddies, summon

64
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
What percentage is it at?

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,800
The summoning progress is at sixty percent

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
Sixty percent!

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,760
Is this also my tool for summoning buddies?

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,320
So cute

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,320
Summon buddies

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
Did the buddies arrive?

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
Did they arrive?

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,960
Did they arrive?

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Successfully summoned the three heroes of the bamboo forest

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,800
Wait for me, friends

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm coming to find you

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
Where are you

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,280
Where are you

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,760
Miaomiao

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Musen

80
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,200
Miaomiao

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,640
Mu Sheng

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,320
Miao Miao

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,480
Miao Miao

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,800
Miaomiao

85
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
How have you been?

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
It's much better to see you.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,440
Musen

88
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Miaomiao

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
Do you have something you want to say to me?

90
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,880
How about

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,160
giving Miaomiao a pot?

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
No, give Miaomiao a bag.

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,760
Musheng

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,680
How do you know?

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,040
This is the most popular bag in our world.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Because a bag cures all ailments.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Musheng, you even carried memes in ancient times.

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
Asheng has grown up.

99
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,640
Alright, no more acting.

100
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,560
Friends,

101
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
welcome to

102
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,320
the support base I prepared for you.

103
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,040
This is each of your roll-up banners.

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
What is a roll-up banner?

105
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
Sister Mu,

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
a roll-up banner is something modern people

107
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,320
use for support.

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
Look at your photo

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
I printed it right here

110
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
Who is this

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
So handsome

112
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Who is this

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,760
Looks so much like chicken strips, isn't it

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,720
Thanks to Miaomiao for preparing these for us

115
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,600
No need to thank me, it's what I should do

116
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,480
A cute person with a kind heart

117
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,400
Thank you

118
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,800
There's a demon

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,760
Mosquito demon

120
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,560
What

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Quick, set off the fireworks

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,840
Set off the fireworks

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,480
Break

124
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Alright, stop acting

125
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,080
Now we need to awaken

126
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,720
our system lords

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
System lord

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Where are you

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Who woke me up

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,440
Come

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,840
Come over here

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,000
So it was you who woke me up

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So cute

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
I am Cold Spirit - Little 9

135
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,160
I received a commission from the system lord

136
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,480
to be your caring guardian

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
When you need me

138
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,600
you can use Little 9's special command to call me out

139
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Okay, what is your special command

140
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
Caring companionship

141
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Forever and ever

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,680
Okay

143
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I should go to sleep.

144
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,400
So soon?

145
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Don't forget,

146
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,200
we still have a task to complete today.

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
Drawing fans' wishes.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
It's drawing from this box.

149
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,920
Okay.

150
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,320
Bye-bye.

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,640
Bye-bye.

152
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm going to sleep.

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,240
You're going to sleep?

154
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
Bye-bye.

155
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,200
I really want to get off work.

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Three hours of makeup for two minutes of appearance.

157
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Then I'll draw this task card.

158
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
The Four Heroes of the Bamboo Forest.

159
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
Silhouette blockbuster.

160
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
We'll fulfill it right away.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
Yes, let's put this on our big brother Liu's head first.

162
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Let's go.

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,880
Let's go.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Come and get your luggage

165
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Don't play here

166
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,720
It seems someone is calling us to get our luggage

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,960
Musheng

168
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,440
Miaomiao

169
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,040
Let's go

170
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,520
Miaomiao

171
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,120
Musheng

172
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Miaomiao

173
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Left, right, left

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,040
One, two, three, go

175
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Left, right

176
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,400
Left

177
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
Turn right

178
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Not there yet

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,680
Feels like military training

180
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,240
We're here

181
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,840
Here is your luggage

182
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,640
Go get it quickly

183
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Let's go

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,280
Alright, follow me

185
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,000
Welcome everyone to Weizhou Island

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,080
We are about to start a three-day, two-night

187
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Four Heroes Team Spirit Trial Journey

188
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,200
First, let's play a little game

189
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,480
to test the team spirit index of the four of you

190
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,240
Okay

191
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Each of us will choose

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,920
one character from the phrase "Four Heroes of the Bamboo Forest"

193
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,640
Each person will claim a corresponding character

194
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
There must be some hidden mystery in it.

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Then I'll choose "Hero"

196
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,560
Because today I'm in a heroine mood

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,480
I'll choose "Four" because "Four" is next to "Hero"

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
Then I'll choose "Bamboo"

199
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
"Bamboo" is the first one

200
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Then I'm left with "Forest"

201
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,280
You can choose something else too

202
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,640
But we won't allow it

203
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,720
Won't allow it

204
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,080
Let's go with "Forest", "Forest" is pretty good

205
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
The next game will test

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,640
Will test the speed of the four demon hunters

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,880
Reaction

208
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,480
And endurance

209
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Sunflower seed spelling contest

210
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
The word "hero" is quite hard to spell.

211
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,160
The word "hero" is quite hard to spell.

212
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,560
Who is the "hero"?

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,560
It's

214
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,080
"hero"

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,920
You are the "hero".

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,960
Heroine

217
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,160
It's a bit difficult.

218
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,680
No worries, we will help you.

219
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Three

220
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Two

221
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,960
One

222
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,400
Start

223
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
I have an idea.

224
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,480
I finished it.

225
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,640
What are you

226
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,680
unable to see this?

227
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,720
What character is this?

228
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,520
"Four"

229
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,920
"Four" means the Chinese character "four"

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,480
Right

231
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Not the Arabic numeral "4"

232
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,880
Never mentioned

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
It is written there

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,640
Is it

235
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,840
unexpected

236
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,200
What was I again?

237
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,960
"Bamboo"

238
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,520
I need the Chinese character for "four"

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Not this Arabic numeral "4"

240
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,880
Never said that

241
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,000
It says there

242
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,640
The word "hero" is quite hard to spell.

243
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,560
You are a "hero".

244
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,360
Heroine.

245
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
It's a bit difficult.

246
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,920
Alright, it's done.

247
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,000
I finished mine too.

248
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,760
Brother Liu, you are too honest.

249
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
You put together a large floral character.

250
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,040
We are the

251
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,080
mini version.

252
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,480
Yes.

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
You are all the mini versions.

254
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,720
Then I really

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,680
restore Liu Fuyi.

256
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
It feels like Brother Liu

257
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,080
while eating these sunflower seeds,

258
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,800
is also gossiping about others.

259
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,160
It's very chaotic.

260
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,520
So, what do you think of these four characters now?

261
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,640
Have you developed a team spirit?

262
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,680
The three of us have team spirit.

263
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,640
But Brother Liu doesn't have team spirit.

264
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,080
This is so perfect.

265
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
This doesn't pass.

266
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,480
There's no room to stay in today.

267
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,400
You can stay in the lobby today.

268
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,360
They won't even let me stay in the house.

269
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,680
Quickly remove your makeup and then go back.

270
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,360
Thank you.

271
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,760
Do you want to check out the room first?

272
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
Sure, let's go.

273
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,840
Miaomiao

274
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,720
You can open this room.

275
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,080
Okay.

276
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,160
Leave the luggage here, otherwise

277
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,360
don't drag it back and forth.

278
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you, Musheng.

279
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,360
Welcome to our world.

280
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
Quick, sit down.

281
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
First time here

282
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,520
I was very excited

283
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
Yes, it's my first time too.

284
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
Participating in the group variety show.

285
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,440
I think it should be a lot of fun.

286
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,720
Can you talk about your thoughts on this group variety show?

287
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,680
This wish.

288
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,440
Right now?

289
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,520
Right now, my neck feels very sore.

290
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,800
My neck is a bit sore.

291
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,360
Are you sore?

292
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,960
Sore.

293
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,280
Sore.

294
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,720
No.

295
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
How about we support each other?

296
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,720
Turn your back to him.

297
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,520
Has everyone noticed the comments from netizens?

298
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
Actually, we are very happy.

299
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Just seeing others leave us comments.

300
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,920
And then it's like,

301
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,680
how should I say it,

302
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,360
I saw that they seem to

303
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,760
say they want us to make a

304
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,720
video with the four of us.

305
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Something like that.

306
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,000
And just be happy.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,800
Indeed.

308
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
I think all of us

309
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
are here,

310
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
we are together,

311
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,040
everyone is already very happy.

312
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Right?

313
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
Why didn't you turn around?

314
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,240
Didn't you say you would turn around?

315
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,640
I did turn.

316
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
We missed a shot.

317
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
Someone else filmed hers too.

318
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
The Four Heroes of the Bamboo Forest

319
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,400
Next, there is a mysterious mission

320
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,320
Please proceed to the other room one by one

321
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Okay

322
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,040
Who goes first

323
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,760
Let Liu Fuyi go first

324
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,840
This is the beginning of the secret room

325
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
Start doing the solo mission

326
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
Go to the mission room over there

327
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,880
What mission

328
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,800
Why is it so dark in here?

329
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
Are there any scary parts inside?

330
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,760
What do you mean?

331
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,560
What do you think it could be?

332
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,280
I am an undercover agent.

333
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
Do you want to be an undercover agent?

334
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Yes.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Do you think you can handle it?

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Challenge those three?

337
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,240
I think those three definitely won't suspect me.

338
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,200
Okay.

339
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Whose turn is it?

340
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,360
I'll go.

341
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,640
Why do you laugh like that when you come back?

342
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
I'll go experience it.

343
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
The local customs.

344
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
The princess is going out.

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,640
Which room?

346
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
Which room?

347
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
It can't be a ghost, right? I'm scared.

348
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,120
It can't be a "ghost," right?

349
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,160
I don't dare

350
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,760
I don't dare go into the secret room

351
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,560
Open the door

352
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,960
What's wrong, Miaomiao

353
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,760
Open the door

354
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,120
Let me tell you

355
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
I guessed it might be a secret room, right

356
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,880
Someone is scaring us, right

357
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,440
It must be

358
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
Musen, let's go together

359
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,000
I already guessed it

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,600
Let's go

361
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Musen, you have to protect me

362
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,200
You have to protect me

363
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Let's go

364
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
Protect Miaomiao

365
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
Let's go

366
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,560
What happened over there

367
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
I'll take you to see the scenery

368
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,640
No, I shouldn't go

369
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,720
Only Miaomiao and Asheng should go

370
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,640
Hurry up and tell me

371
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
We're in this together

372
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,080
You have to go too

373
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm not going

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,040
Tell me secretly

375
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,960
No one is recording inside

376
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,640
Secretly

377
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
No, can you stop acting?

378
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,440
There are almost three cameras.

379
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,600
If I had something, I would tell you.

380
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:49,960
Is that okay?

381
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,920
Let's make a trade.

382
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,600
I already know.

383
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
You don't need to tell me.

384
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,360
You're so annoying.

385
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Just wait.

386
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
You'll get what's coming to you.

387
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
No.

388
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
He's like this when filming.

389
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
He really keeps his mouth shut.

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can't pry anything out of him.

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,640
Hard to pry.

392
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
You tell me, then you tell me.

393
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,320
I'm really scared.

394
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm not scared.

395
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Listen to the sound.

396
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,880
Musen, you have to protect me, Musen

397
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,560
I will protect you

398
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,240
I will protect you

399
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,880
You protect me

400
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,920
You go in first

401
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,200
Then you tell me what it is

402
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,600
Still

403
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,840
come out

404
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,600
I saw you

405
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,320
come out

406
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,480
Your shadow gave you away

407
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,080
Did you set this up?

408
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Set up? When did I have time to set up?

409
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,000
Sis

410
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
Hurry up and open the door

411
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,600
Tell him I'm in the bathroom

412
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,320
Hurry up

413
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Your sister is in the bathroom

414
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,720
Okay

415
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,320
So scary

416
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,080
So scary

417
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,640
Where is Miaomiao?

418
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Too scary

419
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,800
Be careful later

420
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,600
What is it?

421
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Exactly

422
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,000
Tell Sis

423
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,360
Security check

424
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,920
Sis

425
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,360
What about you?

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,240
Can you get into character?

427
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,400
Quick, tell the security

428
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
I said

429
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,280
What, there's security over there?

430
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
No, just go check it out later

431
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
Anyway, be careful

432
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,080
Be careful

433
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,640
I see you

434
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
Come out

435
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
Your shadow gave you away

436
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Give me that light

437
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
Miaomiao is safe

438
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,200
What do you mean

439
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,840
Safe

440
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
Everyone come out

441
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,120
No

442
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Am I overthinking it?

443
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
It's just a little bunny apple

444
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,320
I overthought it

445
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
You're back

446
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,240
Come in

447
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,520
Isn't it scary

448
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,600
What's wrong

449
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,800
That secret room almost scared you to "death," right

450
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,640
Yes

451
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,280
So scary

452
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
Sis, there was a shadow just now

453
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes

454
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Sis, you didn't go, right

455
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,760
Go, it's super scary

456
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,560
Be very careful

457
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,880
Be careful

458
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,720
What's inside

459
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
There are a bunch of people to scare you

460
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
In some unexpected corners

461
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,760
Who will go with me

462
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,400
You go by yourself.

463
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,320
You go by yourself.

464
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,160
Then I'll go.

465
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Please sit.

466
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,880
I still want to say that...

467
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,120
I hope you can make me look smarter.

468
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,800
Do you think you're not smart enough?

469
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,000
The real me is very smart.

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,680
Satisfied.

471
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
There are eight rabbit-shaped apples on the plate in front of you.

472
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,440
You need to divide these eight among the other three people.

473
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,800
How will you distribute them?

474
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
This isn't some deep undercover mission.

475
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
Why are you being so mysterious?

476
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,760
Two for Musheng and Miaomiao.

477
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,680
Two each.

478
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,560
Four for Ayao.

479
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Because I think if Ayao cares about me,

480
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,360
she will definitely give me two back.

481
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,480
But if she doesn't return them,

482
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,680
she must have eaten them all.

483
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320
Four for Asheng

484
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,160
Four for Miaomiao

485
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,920
Then

486
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
Liufuyi doesn't eat

487
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,920
Why

488
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,480
Because I don't have any either

489
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,200
He accompanies me

490
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Through thick and thin

491
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Okay

492
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,640
Give everything to Miaomiao

493
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
The little rabbit apples are only related to her

494
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
So I give everything to her

495
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
If you think Miaomiao

496
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,520
How will she distribute these eight apple slices

497
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,200
The truth

498
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
is only one

499
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,960
Miaomiao will give me all eight apples

500
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Okay

501
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,960
Then I'll just divide them evenly

502
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,160
This big one can go to Liu Fuyi

503
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Like this

504
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
This pretty one can go to Sister Mu Yao

505
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
Be nicer to the girls

506
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
This one is good for Mu Sheng

507
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,320
Give one more piece to Brother Liu and Sister Mu Yao

508
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,440
Each gets an extra piece

509
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Ling Miaomiao will give me eight apples

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
all to me

511
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
because

512
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,880
these two look better

513
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,440
so I put the two high-quality rabbit apples

514
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,040
together

515
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,760
You

516
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,440
Musen, come sit over here

517
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Then sit next to me

518
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,120
I really like this relaxed feeling

519
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
Come a little closer

520
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,160
The famous gentleman

521
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,520
You two lean together as well

522
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
I want to see

523
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,560
You two do the same

524
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,320
Is it appropriate

525
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,960
I want to see

526
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,240
Then I'll be the big bird leaning on you

527
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
You be the ostrich leaning on me

528
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,120
He's coming

529
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,800
He's coming

530
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
Let me record this historic moment

531
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,280
How do you feel about coming to the island

532
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,760
First time coming to Weizhou Island

533
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,560
Seeing the local customs and culture

534
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
Where have you all been

535
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,920
We

536
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,600
The makeup room

537
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
You haven't been anywhere

538
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,320
We just went to the hotel

539
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
But I felt everyone's enthusiasm

540
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
During the three-day team building

541
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,720
What role do you think each of you will take on?

542
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,480
Evaluate what?

543
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,360
What role?

544
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
Sister's loading is always half a beat slow

545
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,760
Didn't hear clearly

546
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,440
Is it Musen?

547
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,160
Energy role

548
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,160
I think he is the reaction role

549
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,520
Just won't let the conversation

550
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:48,920
Yes

551
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Fall to the ground

552
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,680
Everyone has to respond

553
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,520
I should also be someone who doesn't let the conversation fall

554
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,200
The person on the ground

555
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,120
I am, I know I am the process advancement role

556
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
Inspiration role

557
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,880
Because she sometimes comes up with great ideas

558
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,440
Why do you look at people so affectionately?

559
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Because I have 600-degree myopia

560
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,560
Oh, I see

561
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
What about sister?

562
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,920
Tipsy expert

563
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,200
She must be the one

564
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,720
Delay expert

565
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,240
Why did you prop it up?

566
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
Praise

567
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,840
Praise

568
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,440
Praise, praise, then think about it later

569
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Beauty expert

570
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,960
Looks expert

571
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
Then I'll say Liu Fuyi

572
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,040
Otherwise

573
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,760
Liu Fuyi

574
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,040
He is the one who always talks too much.

575
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,600
He talks a lot, I'm telling you.

576
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,240
Whenever someone says one thing, he responds with two.

577
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,640
Are you trying to ruin the reputation of the famous Gentleman Fu Yi?

578
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,600
The one who talks too much.

579
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,320
What image is left?

580
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,840
Alright

581
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,520
Do you know what the plan is for tomorrow?

582
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,560
What is it? I'm so excited.

583
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,680
Are we going fishing tomorrow?

584
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,400
Didn't they say

585
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,280
She revealed it

586
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
My specialty

587
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,280
What is your fishing record?

588
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,440
The fishing record is to go

589
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,600
Deep sea fishing with my staff

590
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
After catching one

591
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,080
Because it was 100 kilograms

592
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,840
We were already too late

593
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,760
We didn't want to fish anymore

594
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,160
Caught

595
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,960
But they wanted to

596
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
They felt they had to bring back twenty

597
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,360
Performance targets

598
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,520
So they said no

599
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
Keep fishing

600
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,360
And they pushed us to the limit

601
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,280
Caught more than ten

602
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,240
I went deep-sea fishing once before

603
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Actually, after the boat set off

604
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,920
I got seasick

605
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,760
Yes

606
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
Then I got really excited

607
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,200
I said I was going deep-sea fishing

608
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,880
I was going out to sea

609
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,520
Where are the fish

610
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,440
Then after five minutes, I said I wanted to go back

611
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,440
So if we go out to sea tomorrow

612
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
We still need to

613
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
Everyone needs to take the seasickness medicine

614
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,880
And apply the seasickness patch

615
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,320
I won't take it first

616
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
I'll try it first

617
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,160
I want to be strong all my life

618
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,520
I really don't believe in bad luck

619
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,480
Then don't lie on the deck

620
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,920
Okay

621
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,400
Let's set a goal, everyone

622
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,600
I need to last at least ten minutes

623
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,760
Because I lasted five minutes last time

624
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,240
You all have a beginner's protection period

625
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,560
Why

626
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Sis, I just

627
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,640
Completely explained it

628
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,720
Why

629
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,200
So funny

630
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,840
Sister wants to catch some fish

631
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,160
I think

632
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,560
Because I haven't fished before

633
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
About ten

634
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
About ten

635
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,600
How many

636
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,960
Are you sure, sister?

637
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,840
I think that fish could pull you in.

638
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,760
How many did you catch?

639
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,480
I caught seven.

640
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
Because of that fish.

641
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,640
I don't know who is stronger.

642
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,280
You better catch a strong sea fish.

643
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,680
Not even one.

644
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,280
I need to hold on for at least ten minutes.

645
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,840
Because I lasted five minutes last time.

646
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
But I might be the first one to catch a fish.

647
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,160
Let's go.

648
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,560
The sunlight is great.

649
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
I'll take a picture for you.

650
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,480
So high.

651
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,120
Fairy.

652
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,880
Not bad.

653
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,720
Cowherd and Weaver Girl.

654
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,160
Muyao, look at him.

655
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,240
Okay.

656
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,280
You are really a great travel companion.

657
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,800
Thank you.

658
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,640
I need to hold on for at least ten minutes.

659
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,040
I feel like throwing up.

660
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,880
A little.

661
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,640
There are no fish down here.

662
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,680
We can't catch even one fish?

663
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,760
No movement here.

664
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
Come on, fish.

665
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
Come over here, there are fish.

666
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,600
Who caught it?

667
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,480
So many fish?

668
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
Fishing expert.

669
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
Look, is that a whale?

670
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,400
We saw a whale.

671
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,000
We saw a whale.
