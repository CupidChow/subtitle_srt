1
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:31,251
Mu Sheng, come here.
There are fish here.

2
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:33,395
Mu Sheng, let's do this together.

3
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,355
Cheers.

4
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:39,507
Cheers.

5
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,235
The Shining Stars.

6
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,680
=The Shining Stars=

7
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:53,920
(Weizhou Island Day 3)

8
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,120
(Guesthouse 9:00 AM)

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,320
What is this?

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,480
Is this today's task card?

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,200
The Shining Stars.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
So many words.

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,280
So cautious.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,160
Is this today's task?

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
Let me take a look.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
Why do I have to write papers?

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,760
(Lost control for a second)

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,560
Why do I have to write papers
in the morning?

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,440
What is this?

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Today is the third day
on Weizhou Island.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,000
You will experience

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,080
different professions as islanders,

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,280
to gain a deeper understanding
of three treasures of Weizhou.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,880
Predict what others will do today.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
The one who
makes the right predictions...

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,800
...will have the right
to let three others

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
fulfill his/her wish.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,600
So this is...

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
This is a prediction report.

30
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:56,992
(Prediction report?)

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Okay, now I need a pen.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,840
I don't have a pen now.

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,400
(Quiz: How will Mr. Fuyi obtain a pen?
A. Call for Mu Yao, B. Borrow one, C. Take out from the pocket)

34
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:08,224
(Mr. Fuyi)

35
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,792
(can do it himself)

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
I got a pen.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,280
Then, let me think.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,600
Shuxin.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,840
I predict...

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,200
I think,

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
based on my understanding of them,

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,720
someone will definitely write

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,000
I predict that Ding Yuxi will

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,800
tell clichéd jokes.

45
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:32,979
(I've already known your predictions)

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
The one who understands you best is me.

47
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:35,539
(Me too)

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,800
I think that Shuxin might say,

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,320
"Zhu, come here."

50
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,560
Then I say, "Okay."

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,120
For the last one,

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
I wrote a very long one.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Yao will...

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,680
A very long sentence.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
If she completes them all,

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I should get a high score.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,560
Right?

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,800
Such an accurate prediction.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
(Secret)
Then

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,040
we'll see the outcome.

61
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,600
And then,

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,560
I want you to see...

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
Sorry, Mr. Yang.

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,960
I want everyone
to see your profile picture.

65
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,419
(What?)

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
It's funny.

67
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,296
(What?)

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Next,

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,760
let's start our first islander lesson.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,040
The place we are going to today

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,480
needs to be conveyed in Hakka dialect.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Hakka dialect.

73
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,120
Please remember this dialect

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
and pass it on
to the next person in turn.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Okay.

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
(Haicheng District, Weizhou Town.)

77
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,696
(What?)

78
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,608
(Don't want to face it)

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,320
(The brain has burned out)
(Haicheng District, Weizhou Town.)

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
(No.89, Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.)

81
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:45,640
(Like a beast)

82
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Wait.

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,840
Bring the speaker closer.

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
Bring it closer. Put it here.

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
Wait, stop.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,600
Do you have paper and a pen?

87
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,280
(Someone, bring on the props)

88
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,400
(Second time)

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,360
(Haicheng District, Weizhou Town.)

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,000
(Writing)
(No. 89, Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.)

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,640
The first one should be

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,080
something like "young man".

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,280
This is

94
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,000
the address of our next destination.

95
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,192
(Address?)

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Address?

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
Alright.

98
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
Are you confident?

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm not, but we have Shuxin.

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
(Shuxin is always there)
So I plan to find Yu Shuxin

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,240
Hurry.

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,760
I can't remember too much.

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
Where is Shuxin?

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
I really can't remember too much.

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Haicheng District,

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,800
Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.

107
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,160
No. 89.

108
00:04:39,443 --> 00:04:42,360
(Yu Shuxin's room)

109
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
Coming.

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,840
Okay.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,160
No rush.

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
(No rush, no way)
No way.

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village,
Haicheng District.

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Blah...

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,240
Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,160
No. 89.

117
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Coming.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
No rush.

119
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,520
(Just accept it)

120
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Haicheng District.

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,880
(Anxious)
Blah...

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.

123
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,400
Come on.

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,280
Haicheng District.

125
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,760
Blah...

126
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,360
No. 89, Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Who are you?

128
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
(Replied randomly)
I'm fine, thank you.

129
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
(Xi is here)
I said "Who are you?"

130
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,960
Nice.

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
What do you want to tell me?

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
Haicheng District.

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
What do you want to tell me?

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,440
Haicheng District.

135
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,160
Blah...

136
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
(I'm asking)
Xijiao Village, Xijiao Road.

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
No. 89.

138
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,680
What does it mean?

139
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
He said it's an address.

140
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,080
You have to pass this message on to...

141
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,720
(Pass it on?)
Anyone?

142
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Any chosen person.

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,640
I want to write it down in my own way.

144
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,560
What? Say it.

145
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,272
(In same style)

146
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Haicheng District.

147
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:48,840
Sausage?

148
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
Is it a sausage?

149
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:50,707
(She is clever)

150
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:51,440
(He is confused)

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Haicheng District.

152
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
And then there is a part

153
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,240
that I didn't note down.

154
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,040
Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.

155
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880

156
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,680
No. 89.

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,960
Alright.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,040
Okay.

159
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
Then let's go find Sister Mu.

160
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Alright.

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
Good morning.

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Secret room?

163
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,400
(Islander Lesson 2:
Escape from the secret room again?)

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,120
(Naughty Cat)
What does it mean?

165
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,312
(Indulgent Leopard)

166
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,072
(Affectionate Sister)

167
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
I tell her, right?

168
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
Yes.

169
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840

170
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,360

Xijiao Village.

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,800
(Confused)
Xijiao Road.

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,920
(Want to leave)
No. 89.

175
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,280
(Choose to accept it)

176
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,560
A sentence?

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
Just a sentence.

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,520
We even missed a sentence.

179
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:07,027
(Missed a sentence)

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Haicheng District.

181
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,440
Blah...

182
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,720
(Entered the innovation scene)

183
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,400
(Obsessed with creating)
Xijiao Road.

184
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,440
And then?

185
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,680
No. 89.

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Alright.

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,840
I already know.

188
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,360
Then she'll go look for...

189
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,240
Brother Liu.

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
No.

191
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,168
(Doorbell search failed)

192
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
This is like a secret room.

193
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,736
(Same kind of surprise)

194
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Now I'll teach you the dialect.

195
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,440
Remember well.

196
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,840
Haicheng District.

197
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,760
Xijiao Village.

198
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,280
Xijiao Road.

199
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,840
(Staring)

200
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,760
No. 89.

201
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Say it again.

202
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,960
Well,

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
just write it on your hand.

204
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,120
Haicheng District.

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,560
Xijiao Village.

206
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,800
Then

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,880
Xijiao

208
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,680
Road.

209
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
No.

210
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
89.

211
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,080
Okay.

212
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,720
Done.

213
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
I trust you.

214
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:20,576
("Handwriting")

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,840
Where are we going now?

216
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
Is that front desk guy there?

217
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
Let's go.

218
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,600
Hello.

219
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Hello, welcome.

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
(Another day of socializing)
It's you.

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,600
It's me again.

222
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
So familiar.

223
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,080
I have a sentence,

224
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,120
and I need you to help me interpret.

225
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,120
Haicheng District.

226
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,760
Xijiao Village.

227
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,160
Xijiao Road.

228
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
No. 89.

229
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,920
It's an address.

230
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,680
It's an address.

231
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,760
An address.

232
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,640
We should go there to do something.

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,520
Please repeat it again.

234
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,040
Slower.

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Please say it again.

236
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,960
Haicheng District.

237
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Xijiao Village.

238
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,560
Xijiao Road.

239
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
No. 89.

240
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
(Original)
(Haicheng District, Weizhou Town.)

241
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,520
(No. 89, Xijiao Road, Xijiao Village.)

242
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
It should be

243
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
Haicheng District,

244
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,200
(This works)
Weizhou Town.

245
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
Xijiao Village,

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,520
Xijiao Road,

247
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
No. 89.

248
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,200
You can understand this?

249
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
So...

250
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
So, you were right just now.

251
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,720
This is the address by the crew?

252
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,960
(In that case)

253
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:30,099
(Everyone understands)

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes.

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,640
No matter what we say,

256
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,040
she can always tell.

257
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:36,608
(Why does the crew
give away the answer?)

258
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:38,720
(Half an hour ago)

259
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
Haicheng District.

260
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
Xijiao

261
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,080
Village.

262
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
Xijiao Road.

263
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,160
No. 89.

264
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,080
What does it mean?

265
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
It's difficult?

266
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay, we...

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,400
(Twenty minutes ago)
Thank you.

268
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,640
It should be some Village and Road.

269
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
What was it?

270
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
And then...

271
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,120
I can speak local language.

272
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,064
But I really don't understand it.

273
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:00,864
(Local decoding failed)

274
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,960
Hello.

275
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,560
Hello.

276
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,800
I have a sentence,

277
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,240
and I need you to help me interpret.

278
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Can you come over?

279
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,160
Xijiao Village.

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,240
Xijiao Road

281
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
No. 9 Haicheng.

282
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Haicheng No. 9.

283
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
Where is Brother Liu?

284
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,120
Are you sure this sounds right?

285
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:16,480
(Five minutes ago)

286
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:17,216
(Haven't they found it yet?)

287
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,163
(They've been asking
for half an hour now)

288
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,872
(How about we just tell them?
Okay, or it's impossible to complete)

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,600
This is the address by the crew?

290
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes.

291
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:29,560
(I find it difficult too)

292
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,280
Let's go.

293
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,640
Let's go.

294
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,680
Such a big sun.

295
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
The sunshine is so harsh.

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
So harsh.

297
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
I have to keep an eye on you.

298
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:44,160
(Eyes open wide)

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,960
Don't open your eyes so wide.

300
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,760
It's too deliberate.

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,880
Hurry.

302
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,600
Let's go, walk the runway.

303
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,920
One, two, three, go.

304
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,000
Are we going or not?

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Cooperate with me.

306
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
Who's driving today?

307
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,120
Me.

308
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,200
Let's go.

309
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go.

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's go.

311
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,960
♪Even if I encounter storms
and crash into flames♪

312
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,440
♪Even if the thorns cover me♪

313
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
Here.

314
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,640
I really want to fish.

315
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,440
Alright, let's get out of the car.

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,160
Let's go.

317
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:48,851
(Anticipating)

318
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
I feel like a kindergarten teacher.

319
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Let's get out of the car.

320
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,000
(Arriving at Island Cafe)
This way.

321
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,760
(Island Cafe)
Island Cafe.

322
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Sustainability concept brings benefits.

323
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,920
Complete any one of the following,

324
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
then you can get
a cup of coffee for free.

325
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,040
2.5 kilograms of ocean trash.

326
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
I like picking up ocean trash.

327
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,560
Hello.

328
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
Hello.

329
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,040
Hello.

330
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,640
Welcome to Island Cafe.

331
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,560
Hello.

332
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,200
So beautiful.

333
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
This is perfect for photographing.

334
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,520
It's really beautiful.

335
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm treating you to coffee today.

336
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Thank you.

337
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,000
Alright, now we can sit down.

338
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
Let me talk about the concept
of this cafe

339
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,360
and share the story with you.

340
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,600
Okay, manager.

341
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,600
You've arrived here.

342
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,280
And you've looked around.

343
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,680
What do you think of the sea here?

344
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,400
I think it looks quite blue

345
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
and clean.

346
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
We went out to sea
for fishing a few days ago.

347
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
We didn't see much garbage.

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,040
Yes, it's quite clean.

349
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,160
Actually,
I am the fourth-generation islander.

350
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,720
So why did you think of

351
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
opening a cafe like this over here?

352
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
When I was very young,

353
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
there weren't many tourists

354
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,600
and outsiders coming here.

355
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,080
The coral reef

356
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,640
was as tall as this house.

357
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
Before, there used to be

358
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,920
sharks this big.

359
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,040
They're gone now, right?

360
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,960
Very rare now.

361
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
Because we didn't understand

362
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,000
the importance of the marine ecosystem.

363
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,120
And during the development,

364
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,720
we have caused some pollution.

365
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,040
Because you love this place,

366
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,160
and when you watch it
become more and more polluted,

367
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
and you want to protect it,

368
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,560
so you open a cafe.

369
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,280
Yes.

370
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,800
Calling on more people

371
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
to pick up the trash in the sea,

372
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,480
and preserve this place

373
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,720
well together.

374
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

375
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,880
Because I have my own children,

376
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
the fifth generation.

377
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,880
I hope when they grow up,

378
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
they will see some recovery.

379
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,480
I invite you here today,

380
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
we also hope to appeal for our cause.

381
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,520
Yes, we're happy...

382
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,040
To protect this island.

383
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,000
(Island Letter/Island Environmental Volunteer)
Our cafe upholds

384
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,760
(Zero Waste Island)
the sustainable and environmentally friendly concept.

385
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
Here, you can get coffee

386
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
by exercising
and picking up marine rubbish.

387
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,560
As long as the island is clean,

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,040
the people living here

389
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,000
will have a much brighter future.

390
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,808
(Protecting the Marine Ecosystem,
Guarding the Blue Planet)

391
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I didn't expect that,
in just three days,

392
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,880
we could be part of

393
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,680
such a meaningful project.

394
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
I really love the sea.

395
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,840
So do I.

396
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,640
Let's all toast to you.

397
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:24,920
Thank you.

398
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,720
Thank you.

399
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,400
Thank you.

400
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,480
We hope

401
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,920
you to be store managers for an hour.

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,640
We will donate

403
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
all the money you earn

404
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,360
to a charitable

405
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,400
organization

406
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,040
for the island.

407
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
It's an organization.

408
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Then this guy will teach you

409
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
how to operation this cafe

410
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
and solve the problems.

411
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,120
Okay.

412
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,960
Alright.

413
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,680
Okay.

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,080
(Manager Xin is here)
Okay, as someone who has run a shop.

415
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,280
I will assign your tasks.

416
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,800
Okay.

417
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,480
Okay.

418
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
You two, go make coffee.

419
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,440
(How do workers sound?)
Okay.

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
- I'll go with Yang Shize.
- Right.

421
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
We will take the front desk.

422
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,520
(Humbly asking)
What do we do at the front desk?

423
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
We'll mop the floor first.

424
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,800
Just kidding.

425
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,520
Let's tidy up here.

426
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,000
Then you are in charge of the front.

427
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,080
We'll take care of the back.

428
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,320
Okay.

429
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
Let's pack up our stuff first.

430
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,552
(Let's get to work)

431
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
I'll make one for myself.

432
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,480
Sure.

433
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
Brother Liu, are you making coffee?

434
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
I'll learn.

435
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,160
Have you done it before?

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
I've made it at home before.

437
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:22,816
(Coffee with me)

438
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,040
If you can make

439
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
that kind of coffee with latte art,

440
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,040
that would be a miracle.

441
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,952
(Wait and see)

442
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,840
Ding.

443
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,400
What will you have?

444
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,480
I would like...

445
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,400
Which one...

446
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Which one that makes
Brother Liu perform a miracle?

447
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
(Sheng love miracles)
Then I'll have that one.

448
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,640
Any of them.

449
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,280
(Just place your order)

450
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,120
I want a latte.

451
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,200
Latte, okay.

452
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Coconut latte, thank you.

453
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,840
(Order received)
Coconut Latte.

454
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,600
Why...?

455
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
There is oilpaper.

456
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,280
Did I press down too light?

457
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,000
Next time, press down on it harder.

458
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Faster.

459
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:07,712
(False alarm)

460
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
So, I can just make it
with this one, right?

461
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,520
Scoop some ice cubes.

462
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,080
Some drink it with ice.

463
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
I thought you can do it.

464
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
You don't know how to do it.

465
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,160
I can do it.

466
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:15,968
(Sir, say something.)

467
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:16,659
(Get it)

468
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,880
He can do it.

469
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Iced or hot?

470
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
Hot.

471
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,600
Hot, then don't make it for her.

472
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,944
(Look at me)

473
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,480
(Wish you success)
What?

474
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
Nothing works.

475
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,448
(Man-machine shut down)

476
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,168
(It's hard to skip this)

477
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,400
This needs frothing?

478
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,560
She wants it hot.

479
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,360
Yes.

480
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
Can I get this?

481
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
See, you just can't do it.

482
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:42,400
(It's easier said than done.)

483
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,280
I really can.

484
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:44,512
Which button to press?

485
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,248
Which button to press?

486
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
The machine is different.

487
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,360
Even I can do it.

488
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,240
Downward.

489
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,520
Have you made it before?

490
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,520
I have.

491
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,680
But not very skilled.

492
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,400
Can you not watch?

493
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,040
I'll give you a surprise.

494
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,627
I don't want your surprise.

495
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,760
I need to watch.

496
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,440
Wait, teach me.

497
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,520
Raise it a bit.

498
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,320
Bigger.

499
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,120
It's not stirred well.

500
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,600
(A lot of room for improvement)
What do you mean?

501
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,720
You leave first.

502
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,320
Let me learn first, then you come over.

503
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,640
Look, when flushing, hold it higher.

504
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,960
This is okay.

505
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,720
Not mixed.

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,240
Yes.

507
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,400
Then make the pattern here.

508
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,360
Then swing.

509
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,280
Then push forward gently.

510
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,640
(Learn more)

511
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
I got it.

512
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,040
I got it.

513
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,960
Give this to...

514
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
Wait, I'll do it.

515
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,280
Right, give this to Ding.

516
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
I want this one.

517
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
Give it to me to drink.

518
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,520
I want this one.

519
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Let me have a drink.

520
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,760
You want one with latte art, right?

521
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,400
You make another cup.

522
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,960
Tastes excellent.

523
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,600
Tastes excellent.

524
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,080
Tastes excellent.

525
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,040
Really?

526
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,280
Tastes excellent.

527
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,760
Finished it all?

528
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,400
Can I get a refill?

529
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes, come on.

530
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,280
Give me a refill, please.

531
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,680
(Full of confidence)
Bro, let me try it myself.

532
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,480
Here, this one.

533
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,880
(Getting the hang of it)
You've learned it.

534
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,920
I've learned it.

535
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,600
Okay?

536
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
Okay.

537
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
Pour it in and mix.

538
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,720
Okay, raise it a bit.

539
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,960
Right, it should form a pattern now.

540
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,000
Push it forward a little.

541
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,760
Okay.

542
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,000
(The first miracle is born)

543
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
There's a pattern.

544
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
- Here.
- Thank you.

545
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
Classic latte.

546
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:27,480
(The miracle you love)

547
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,000
This is the heart he made for you.

548
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
Yang Shize, you did this?

549
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
Didn't make it well.

550
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,680
I want to show it to the camera.

551
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
I think it looks good.

552
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,080
(Indeed, it's a miracle)

553
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Yang Shize, it's not the gravity
of stellar that creates miracles.

554
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
It's you who creates miracles.

555
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,560
(More confident)
Really?

556
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,160
Like a garlic.

557
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
Yang Shize.

558
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The pattern you made

559
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,640
is a garlic, right?

560
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,440
(Limited Edition from Liu Fuyi, Garlic latte art)
It's a garlic.

561
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,040
What coffee should we recommend?

562
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,160
Our cafe's

563
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,400
plum Americano is quite tasty.

564
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,040
Plum Americano.

565
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,400
Will there be those finicky customers?

566
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
Shall we do a simulation now?

567
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
Just simulate the entire process.

568
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,680
I'll do it.

569
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,320
(Manager demonstrates personally)
I'll welcome the guests.

570
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I'll do the simulation.

571
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,400
I'll be a customer.

572
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280

Welcome.

573
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120

Welcome.

574
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
(Lofty)
Hello.

575
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
Miss, what would you like to drink?

576
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
Where does a princess sit?

577
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,800
The princess sits here.

578
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,760
Come here.

579
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Bonus.

580
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,960
Tips for this.

581
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,560
What would you like to drink?

582
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,640
Any recommendations?

583
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,080
(Getting ready)

584
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,880
Plum Americano here...

585
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,040
The Plum Americano is good.

586
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,440
One person is enough.

587
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:40,928
(Just let her)

588
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,360
Is the Plum Americano sour?

589
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,840
You could go pick up
some trash in the ocean,

590
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,360
we can give you for free...

591
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,320
(Princess loves eco-friendly too)
I do.

592
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,240
Well, Princess Shuxin,

593
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,600
we made the Plum Americano

594
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,720
ourselves here.

595
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
How do you know my name?

596
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,680
Yeah, because you are famous.

597
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:54,600
(Shuxin, you are quite famous)

598
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,720
You discovered our secret.

599
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,400
Yeah, by the way...

600
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:00,840
(Bold)

601
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Pay for that.

602
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
Pay for that.

603
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Brother Liu.

604
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,960
Well...

605
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,040
He broke the cup.

606
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,760
Even before we started.

607
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,160
May it bring peace.

608
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,120
A small cup was broken.

609
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,432
(Dare not open my eyes,
hoping it's an illusion)

610
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,680
Is it being filmed?

611
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,480
I'll take a close-up for him.

612
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,200
(Give me back the cup)
You...

613
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,080
You need to clean it up.

614
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,640
He broke a cup.

615
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:23,800
(I am the renowned Mr. Fuyi)

616
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm so embarrassed.

617
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,960
Why haven't we had guests?

618
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
Should we go attract customers?

619
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,080
(Slack Off Version 2.0 Lazy Customer)
Customers are so lazy, doesn't come.

620
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,120
Please try our coffee.

621
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,040

624
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,080

626
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,064

628
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,800

Hello, girl.

638
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,600
Do you bring ocean trash?

639
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,560
Yes.

640
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,920
Come, please have a seat.

641
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,120
We'll sit here.

642

Thank you.

643
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,480
What kind of trash do you bring?

644
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
Let me take a look.

645
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,760
Did you pick this up at the beach?

646
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,760
So much trash?

647
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,680
How long did you spend?

648
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
One hour.

649
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,440
One hour.

650
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,800
(Generous)
Then get three cups.

651
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,120
What would you like to drink?

652
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,800
Take a look at the menu.

653
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,080
Everything on here.

654
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,600
What do you want to drink?

655
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,320
Recommend something for them.

656
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,560
The Plum Americano is quite good.

657
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:48,800
(Always paying attention)

658
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
What about the kid?

659
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,480
Then the kid...

660
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,760
(Asking Shuxin)
Is it okay for the kid to drink coffee?

661
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
Does the kid like something sweet?

662
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,760
She can have orange juice.

663
00:21:59,187 --> 00:21:59,720
(Calmly recommends drink
suitable for the kid)

664
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,520
Okay.

665

(Manager is amazing)

666
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,680
Orange juice.

667
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,280
Where is it?

668

669
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,920
Plum Americano and

670
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,600
orange juice.

671
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,040
How about passion fruit juice?

672
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,984
(Recommends passion fruit)

673
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,840
(Passion fruit juice)

674
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,560
That's fine too.

675
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,360
Good.

676
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,840
(Crisis lifted)
Done.

677
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,280
(Plum Americano)
One Plum Americano,

678
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
(Passion fruit juice)
one passion fruit juice,

679
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,720
(Coconut Latte)
and one Coconut Latte.

680
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
Alright.

681
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,800
Please wait a moment.

682
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,680
Thank you.

683
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,640
Can you really handle it?

684
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,720
Of course we can.

685
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:46,272
(Prince Coffee)

686
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,760
It's ready. Plum Americano.

687
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,800
That was quick. What's this?

688
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,480
Plum Americano.

689
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,080
And then the plum is made by them.

690
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,880
Plum Americano.

691
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,160
Who's ordered Plum Americano?

692
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,120
It's for me.

693
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,920
Thank you.

694
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,440
This is our specialty. Please try.

695
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:09,536
(Sister who greets customers)

696
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:10,912
(Slipping away)

697
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:17,344
(Returning to the corner)

698
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,168
(Can't be social at all)

699
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,520
(Outgoing)

700
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,720
What's your name?

701
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,760
Little Lemon.

702
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Why does the waiter just sit down?

703
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,040
(Can't sit)
You shouldn't sit there.

704
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,352
(Obedient)

705
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,240
You should squat next to her to serve.

706
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:41,408
(Crouch down)

707
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:43,091
(Relieved)

708
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
The passion fruit juice is ready.

709
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Here, this is the passion fruit juice
for the little girl.

710
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,360
Thank you.

711
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,040
You're welcome.

712
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,880
Are you here to play?

713
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,560
To play here.

714
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,800
To come here to play?

715
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Have a try.

716
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Have a try.

717
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,760
You're scaring her.

718
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,280
Tastes good?

719
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,200
Tastes good.

720
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Like what you did in Chinese Restaurant?

721
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,528
(Give you an expression)

722
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
I remembered something.

723
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,680
What's wrong?

724
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
I used to work in a cafe before.

725
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,000
Why didn't I know it?

726
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
In high school...

727
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,720
The summer vacation
of my second year in high school.

728
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,920
I just suddenly remembered it.

729
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,880
Because this scene
feels very familiar to me.

730
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
How long did you work this job?

731
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Half a month.

732
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Then you should know
how to make coffee art.

733
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,760
No, they had a barista.

734
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,160
And I worked for cleaning up.

735
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,800
I think you are quite suitable
for Chinese Restaurant.

736
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,120
Shall I recommend you

737
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,280
to go?

738
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,600
I can't take pressure.

739
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,240
Well...

740
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,040
He can't take much pressure.

741
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,560
(Who says Ding isn't great? Ding is super great!)
I'm not good at it.

742
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:49,240
(Taking it slow
is a required course for growth)

743
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,880
See you.

744
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,760
We're leaving.

745
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,560
So soon?

746
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,320
To pick up shells.

747
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,040
Then take a little conch with you, okay?

748
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,120
Take a pretty little conch shell.

749
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,840
Thank her.

750
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,320
Bye.

751
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,360
Bye.

752
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,920
Little Lemon.

753
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,360
Thank you, Little Lemon.

754
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Thank him.

755
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,280
You've done something very meaningful.

756
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,640
Yes.

757
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,520
Thank you.

758
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
Alright, go tell your classmates.

759
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,640
Okay.

760
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,120
Good.

761
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,240
Thank you, Little Lemon.

762
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Bye, see you.

763
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,200
Bye.

764
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
Bye, Little Lemon.

765
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,080
What to do with the rest of this?

766
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Dump it.

767
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,064
(The customer didn't finish their drink)

768
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,840
Too much is left over.

769
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,760
Put it in.

770
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,840
(Disappointed)

771
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,360
Not tasty?

772
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,640
Is it not tasty?

773
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I would like an Americano, thank you.

774
00:25:49,203 --> 00:25:50,976
(I'm here to support you)

775
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,088
(Happy)

776
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,120
She feels like...

777
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,240
She's tipsy again.

778
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,920
Yao.

779
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Thank you.

780
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,720
You drank the most today.

781
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
You are the biggest fan

782
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,480
in this entire cafe.

783
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,040
Try if the plum flavor is too strong.

784
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,160
The plum flavor is strong?

785
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
It's very strong.
How many did you put in?

786
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Two.

787
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
Only two.

788
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
The taste is okay.

789
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,120
Just two make it particularly flavorful.

790
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,040
I'll put this here.

791
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Is it that delicious?

792
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:06,643
(Completely unaware)

793
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:22,432
(Before/After)

794
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Why is there less?

795
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
No, it's just like this.

796
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
The ice has melted.

797
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
I drank it.

798
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:33,536
(Shocked)

799
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,480
I didn't drink with a straw.

800
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,720
(Volume)
I just directly...

801
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
(You two enjoy being together)
I shouldn't be here, but under the car.

802
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,160
(See you)
I'm going to pick up trash in the ocean.

803
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,720
Do you want me

804
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,760
(I understand you)
to take pictures for you?

805
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm waiting for the customers.

806
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,920
Do they dare to come in?

807
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:14,656
(They've already come in)

808
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,680
Hello.

809
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,960
Miaomiao.

810
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,360
Hello.

811
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,160
Hello.

812
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,000
Miaomiao.

813
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,320
Please come in.

814
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Mu Sheng.

815
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Mu Yao.

816
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,560
And Liu Fuyi is also here.

817
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,600
Hello.

818
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,520
You are so beautiful.

819
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,800
Thank you. Please sit...

820
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Sit over there.

821
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,000
Miaomiao, look at it wearing an outfit.

822
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,640
So cute.

823
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
What's its name?

824
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,280
It's called Doudou.

825
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,360
What's its name?

826
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
It's called Mantou.

827
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,640
Mantou.

828
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
Just like the Mantou we eat.

829
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,560
Really cute.

830
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,200
This place is all yours now.

831
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,824
(I've occupied this place.)

832
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:50,080
(Hide)

833
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,960
Do you know you can

834
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,200
exchange collected ocean trash
for coffee?

835
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,440
Or you'll just buy coffee?

836
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
Yes, two ways.

837
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll just buy coffee

838
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,680
because I must
look after two little animals.

839
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,120
Alright.

840
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,880
Okay.

841
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,400
I want the Plum Americano.

842
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,280
I want the Coconut Americano.

843
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,760
Iced Plum Americano
and Iced Coconut Americano.

844
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
(Order received)
Got it.

845
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,123
(New customers have arrived.)

846
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,480
New customers have arrived.

847
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,840
Hello.

848
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,560
Hello.

849
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,520
Hello.

850
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,320
Welcome.

851
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,000
You...

852
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,280
You picked up trash, right?

853
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,440
Thank you.

854
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,320
Please come in.

855
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
Let them sit here.

856
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,160
Right here.

857
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,720
This is the coffee in my shop.

858
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,880
I recommend Plum Americano

859
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,600
and Coconut Latte.

860
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
They are quite tasty.

861
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
(Expertly)
We'll have them.

862
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,080
Do you want it iced or hot?

863
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,400
Iced.

864
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Iced.

865
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,600
Both iced?

866
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,080
Yeah.

867
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
Okay.

868
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,352
(Well done)

869
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,400
One Plum Americano.

870
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
One Coconut Latte.

871
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,280
Both with ice.

872
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,600
(Another order)
Alright.

873
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:54,480
(New customers came.)

874
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,960
Welcome.

875
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,760
Welcome.

876
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,920
Welcome. Please come in.

877
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,800
Orange Americano, please.

878
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,400
Plum Americano, please.

879
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,720
Okay, please have a seat.

880
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:04,512
(Rush of orders)

881
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,520
You can enjoy the sea view here.

882
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,360
Please sit.

883
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,280
Coconut Latte.

884
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,272
(New customers came.)

885
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Welcome.

886
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,400
Welcome.

887
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,520
Plum Americano and Coconut Latte

888
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,720
are quite good.

889
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,800
We want one of each.

890
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Alright.

891
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,131
(Waiting for coffee)

892
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,760
Are you okay?

893
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,960
Do you need help?

894
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,720
No, thanks.

895
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Let me help you.

896
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,960
You go inside.

897
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,120
You have the workstation.

898
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,200
I fear you'll get burned.

899
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
How do I do this?

900
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,640
Pour water.

901
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,800
Pour it in?

902
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,120
Where do I put the plums?

903
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,800
Put the plums in this one.

904
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,920
Put two in?

905
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah, then add some juice.

906
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,720
Okay.

907
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
The juice will
enhance the flavor, right?

908
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,440
Yes, not too much,

909
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
or it might get too sweet.

910
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,920
Three spoons,
as my lucky number is three.

911
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,200
Three spoons?

912
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,320
That much?

913
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,040
Plum Americano.

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
This is your Plum Americano.

915
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,920
Thank you.

916
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,000
It's ready as well.

917
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Give it to me.

918
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,720
This is the Coconut Latte.

919
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,200
Thank you.

920
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Thank you.

921
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,280
Enjoy it.

922
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
Suddenly, it feels like
we're in business.

923
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,720
So happy.

924
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,360
Yeah.

925
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Ding, come here.

926
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,880
Take pictures of the dog.

927
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,320
Mantou.

928
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,720
Look at the camera, Mantou.

929
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,800
Mantou.

930
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Over here.

931
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,360
Good boy.

932
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,280
Well done.

933
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,680
So cute.

934
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,960
So adorable.

935
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,960
Hello, Mantou.

936
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,600
Hello.

937
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,080
Mantou.

938
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,480
Hello, Mantou.

939
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,680
Look in the mirror.

940
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,200
Awesome.

941
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,400
So cool.

942
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,200
This scene is so lovely.

943
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's go.

944
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,160
We can't neglect other customers.

945
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm going in.

946
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,400
We're leaving now.

947
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,200
We can handle it ourselves.

948
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,160
Thank you all.

949
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,680
The coffee is good.

950
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,040
Thanks.

951
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,080
Yes, your coffee is so good.

952
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,040
Thank you.

953
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
Bye.

954
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll see you out.

955
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,240
Thank you, bye.

956
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,000
Bye.

957
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,360
(Finally feels relaxed)

958
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,040
Well,

959
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,080
my friend is your biggest fan.

960
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
He has a small request.

961
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,160
Could Mr. Ding take a photo

962
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,040
for us?

963
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,760
We will sit here.

964
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,160
You just take a picture of us.

965
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,920
There is someone

966
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,680
good at taking photos.

967
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,840
They need you.

968
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
He likes you.

969
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,560
Yes.

970
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:06,880
(Okay, got it.)

971
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,560
Come on.

972
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,520
Where do you prefer?

973
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:08,960
Here.

974
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Okay, I'll do it from outside.

975
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,360
The lighting will be better.

976
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,080
Miss Yu, do me a favor.

977
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,320
Miss Yu, do me a favor.

978
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,960
I didn't expect I actually completely

979
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,200
abandoned you.

980
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,680
Didn't you just help me take it?

981
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Like this.

982
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,160
Okay?

983
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,440
You can hold the coffee.

984
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,880
Okay.

985
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,280
Okay.

986
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,400
Then smile.

987
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,040
Okay.

988
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,960
(Third wheel)

989
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,520
Let's take a couple more inside.

990
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
Okay, it's done.

991
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,200
Okay.

992
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,920
Thank you.

993
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
You're welcome.

994
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Need to tidy up.

995
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,360
Shouldn't we make coffee

996
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,560
for the whole production team?

997
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,080
What's the matter?

998
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,000
You look stunned.

999
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
For the whole production team?

1000
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,480
That's too hard for me.

1001
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,960
Will there be more customers?

1002
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,680
I'll attract some customers.

1003
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,200
No more customers?

1004
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,640
♪On the edge of the cliff♪

1005
00:34:43,763 --> 00:34:45,152

1006
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,280
♪The next stop♪

1007
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,240
Sheng, what have you got?

1008
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,640
Trash.

1009
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,120
Ask Brother Liu to help me.

1010
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,240
He's making coffee.

1011
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,928
(Cleaning)

1012
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,552
(Tidying up)

1013
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,960
I'll help you.

1014
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,360
Let me try.

1015
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,240
It's too heavy.

1016
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,400
Okay.

1017
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:23,712
(Zero Waste Island)

1018
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,960
Hello, I'm back.

1019
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,840
Hello, boss.

1020
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,720
Hello.

1021
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,280
How is the business?

1022
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,800
We have

1023
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,400
made some sales.

1024
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,200
Well done.

1025
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,560
Two people picked up trash.

1026
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,200
And one cup was on the house.

1027
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,680
The method we chose was

1028
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,720
to pick up marine litter.

1029
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
If there's more coffee,

1030
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,600
we'll leave it

1031
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,360
to new customers.

1032
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,080
(All proceeds will be donated to the charity organizations.)
Okay, thank you.

1033
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,440
Thank you.

1034
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,800
This is a meaningful thing.

1035
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,360
Okay, thank you.

1036
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,640
You can go to the chicken coop later.

1037
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,520
What?

1038
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,720
Chicken coop?

1039
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,720
Someone is waiting for you.

1040
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,680
Who?

1041
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,120
It's a secret.

1042
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
A secret?

1043
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,520
Is it someone we know?

1044
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,280
Yes.

1045
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,640
Is it Jiu?

1046
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,720
Thank you.

1047
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,480
Thank you.

1048
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,160
Thanks.

1049
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,960
Thank you.

1050
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,640
Thank you.

1051
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,080
We got a sense of fulfillment.

1052
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,080
We're going to the next stop.

1053
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,704
Catch banana chickens.

1054
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,920
I love small animals.

1055
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,264
(On full alert)

1056
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,360
Chicken tenders.

1057
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:29,600
(Do not disturb)

1058
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Get off now.

1059
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,520
Banana chickens, here we are.

1060
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:36,832
(Enemies?)

1061
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:38,592
(Retreat)

1062
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,640
Such a little one.

1063
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:41,400
(On lookout)

1064
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
So cute.

1065
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,360
Can we sit here?

1066
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,080
Yes.

1067
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:48,224
(Sit right now)

1068
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,600
You catch them first.

1069
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Is this eatable?

1070
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,400
(Good question)

1071
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,360
You can try it.

1072
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,720
The yellow ones are ripe.

1073
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,280
What happens if I eat the green ones?

1074
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,040
You will get anxious
[*sounds like green banana in Chinese]

1075
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,712
(Anxious)

1076
00:37:00,307 --> 00:37:01,960
Good.

1077
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
Nice joke, Brother Liu.

1078
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:04,280
(Bad joker)

1079
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,360
I know it's a bad joke.

1080
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,120
I've been there.

1081
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,880
So I didn't want to embarrass you.

1082
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,040
You're a bad joker too.

1083
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:12,339
(Come on, Brother Liu)

1084
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,720
How could you...?

1085
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,680
So comfortable.

1086
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,320
So relaxed.

1087
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm about to fall asleep.

1088
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,480
So comfortable.

(Don't want to get down)

1090
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,120
I can't rock it.

1091

Could you help me?

1092
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:25,240
(No problem)

1093
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,920
It is like a rocking chair.

1094
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,520

We'll meet in our dreams.

(Struggling)
You guys wait.

1114
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,440
Let me come down.

(I'm fine)

1119
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,640
Well,

1120
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,960
cut out the moment I come down.

1121
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,440
Cut this clip.

(Unanimous opposition)

1123
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,560
Be careful.

It's okay.

1126
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
You get down.

(A bit hesitant)

1129
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,280
Give me a hand.

1130
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,280
We are going to play a game.

1131

(Failed to get the signal)

1132
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,280
How can they be so heartless?

1133
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,680
He just left.

00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,256
(Career-minded)

1135
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,800
Okay, let's start the game.

1136
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,800
(Fan the Ball into the Circle)

1137
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,080
Players will be divided into two groups.

1138
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
Within two minutes,

1139
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,240
blow the balloons into the circle
with a fan.

1140
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,720
For every balloon that goes in,

1141
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,280
you will get two bananas.

1142
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,480
The bananas obtained

1143
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,840
will serve as important props

1144
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,760
for catching chickens.

1145
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,920
(Joanna)
From now on, you'll be called Joanna.

1146
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,800
(Taming balloons)
It's your Cristina.

1147
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
Joanna, be good.

1148
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,760
Be good.

1149
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,520
Let's start.

1150
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,880
Well done.

1151
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,680
(No problem)
Come on!

1152
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,800
Come on, Joanna.

1153
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,840
Joanna.

1154
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Come on, Joanna.

1155
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,880
Joanna.

1156
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,720
Come on, Joanna.

1157
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,560
(Move forward steadily)
Good.

1158
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,600
Joanna.

1159
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,280
Your postures were quite similar.

1160
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,216
(Roughly consistent)

1161
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,440
Well done.

1162
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Joanna.

1163
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,200
Come on, Joanna.

1164
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,120
(Goodbye)

1165
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,080
Shuxin fanned the balloon
back to the hotel.

1166
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:11,520
(I'll handle it.)

1167
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
Go get another one.

1168
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,720
(Received)
I'll take care of this.

1169
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,640
(Taming balloons)
Listen, Rebecca.

1170
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,760
(Rebecca)
Aim for that circle and go in.

1171
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,152
(Balloon training)

1172
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,248
(Off you go)

1173
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:40,096
(A rebellious balloon)

1174
00:40:40,243 --> 00:40:41,600
(I beat you.)

1175
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:43,296
(I beat you.)

1176
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,024
(Three balloons)

1177
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,040
Go.

1178
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,640
Off you go.

1179
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,560
(Go fly)
It's flying, amazing!

1180
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
(Go fly)
It's flying, amazing!

1181

♪Even if I encounter storms
and crash into flames♪

1182

1183
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680

♪I should face every surging wave♪

1185
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,160
Countdown from ten seconds.

1186
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,920
Come on.

1187
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,232
(Time's up)

1188
00:41:33,043 --> 00:41:33,824
(Rebellious balloons)

1189
00:41:37,171 --> 00:41:39,328
(Balloons went wild.)

1190
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,360
(The harder you try,
the sadder you feel.)

1191
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,600
You are a variety show genius.

1192
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:48,992
(The most pathetic guy)

1193
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:50,720
(Second Group)

1194
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
Let's start.

1195
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,960
Let's do this.

1196
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:58,016
(Speed forward)

1197
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,520
(On balloon)
Good.

1198
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:02,208
(Get out)

1199
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,360
(Let's leave together.)
It's out.

1200
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,088
(Hopping)

1201
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:07,136
(Completely unaware)

1202
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,568
(Chasing balloons leisurely)

1203
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:16,576
(Fanning)

1204
00:42:18,624 --> 00:42:19,136
(I'm going.)

1205
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:23,200
(The balloons walk their own path.)

1206
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,000
Come on.

1207
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:27,123
(It's in?)

1208
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,200
It will come out.

1209
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,720
Not going in.

1210
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:37,120
(The more you fan, the farther it goes.)

1211
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,560
Look at her.

1212
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,400
Tipsy.

1213
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,360
So beautiful.

1214
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,240
Film her like this.

1215
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
She's looking for the camera.

1216
00:43:02,035 --> 00:43:03,315
(I'm spotted.)

1217
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,720
Is this pose beautiful?

1218
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,000
You know we're in a game, right?

1219
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:10,464
Hey.

1220
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:11,920
Hey.

1221
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
It went in by itself.

1222
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,280
Is this balloon voice-controlled?

1223
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,760
It's almost done.

1224
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,280
Do we need

1225
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,320
to fan a balloon together?

1226
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:19,264
(Hindsight)

1227
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,080
I want to go over there

1228
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,760
and fan away the balloons in the circle.

1229
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,840
(Don't listen to bad reviews)
Fan away the balloons in the circle.

1230
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,520
Four balloons.

1231
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,800
It's full now. Done.

1232
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:32,920
(Mu Yao and Liu Fuyi
gained four balloons.)

1233
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,720
Alright.

1234
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,800
You have gotten five balloons in total.

1235
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,640
So you'll have ten bananas.

1236
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,440
Next,

1237
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,640
you need to work together
to catch four banana chickens.

1238
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,040
Only then is the task done.

1239
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,200
Okay.

1240
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,000
Alright.

1241
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,360
Yellow ones or green ones?

1242
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,320
Either is fine?

1243
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,800
Take the yellow ones.

1244
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,360
Banana chickens like ripe bananas.

1245
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,120
(New knowledge)

1246
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,600
Okay, take ten.

1247
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,200
Two.

1248
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:57,960
(Shooting photos everywhere)

1249
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,800
Looks pretty good.

1250
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:04,032
(Looks good all the time)

1251
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,120
Good photo.

1252
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,880
Yeah.

1253
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Chinese style.

1254
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,920
Okay, take ten.

1255
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,440
They are moving on to the next one.

1256
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,920
Ten.

1257
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,680
Alright.

1258
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,400
Here's a fun trivia.

1259
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,360
(Share a fun trivia)
Banana chickens like ripe bananas.

1260
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,800
Let me show you

1261
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,560
a banana chicken magic.

1262
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,760
Okay.

1263
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,200

1264
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,000
Go ahead.

1266

That's unbelievable.

1267
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,000
It's so easy to catch them.
