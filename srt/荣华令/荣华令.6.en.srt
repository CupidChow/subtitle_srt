00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,000
General,

4
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,840
may I ask why my mother is there?

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
Who did you protect?

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
Madam, here's the thing.

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,240
The servants of the Shen Mansion said

8
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,320
they wanted to take Mrs. Shen back

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,080
because you returned.

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
But the brothers

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,240
were not as good as them.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,520
So they took Mrs. Shen away.

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,960
It has nothing to do with you.

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,520
Please don't misunderstand me.

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,760
It's my fault.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,640
I should be blamed.

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,240
Why don't you take your mother

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
to the Li Mansion?

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
You can stay with her all the time.

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,360
I...

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Forget it.

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,440
The Li Mansion is complicated.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm worried about her.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
But I have to thank you today.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,320
If you hadn't arrived in time,

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,920
I would have died in her hands.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,760
We are husband and wife.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
I can't just die.

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
Didn't you read the letter?

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,480
Letter?

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,040
What letter?

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Didn't you read the letter?

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,520
Why did you go there?

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,840
The servants of the Chusen Mansion said

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
your mother was taken away.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm afraid something is wrong

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,240
and they rushed back.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,120
It's late.

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Let's go back to the mansion first.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
Your mother needs to rest.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,200
Okay.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,000
Chu.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Chu.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,720
Your Ladyship, you're back.

45
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,560
Where is the letter?

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,200
I didn't wait for you to come back.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,640
I was afraid I would be late.

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,320
I just saw Deputy General Xu

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,880
and handed the letter to him.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
I see. You may leave.

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
Yes.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,200
Who else knows about

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,200
the assassination in the army?

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
No one knows about it

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,920
except for us.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,920
And it's not going to be spread.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
How did she know

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
about it?

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
What?

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
Could it be that

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,920
she was involved in the assassination?

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,400
No wonder she thought

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,320
I went to see her after reading the letter.

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
It turned out that she knew

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
I was interested in the content of the letter.

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Interested?

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
She really underestimated her.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Who is it?

69
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Did you read the letter?

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
How did you know

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
about the assassination?

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,040
I guessed.

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,360
You guessed?

74
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Yes.

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,280
I've been curious about something these days.

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
You released false news

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
and secretly returned to the capital

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
to hide your identity and come to the Shen Family to meet your relatives.

79
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
It's not reasonable.

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,520
If you want to confuse the enemy,

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,400
you should be in other countries at the moment.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
But you returned to the capital,

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,320
which means the murderer is in the capital.

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
And

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,440
others may not know it.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,360
But I've had several close contacts with you.

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
You have a smell of medicine.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,400
Why does she smell like medicine?

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
You're so bold.

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,520
as a accomplice?

92
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
As a accomplice,

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,280
you only know how to interrogate me

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,400
and not kill me.

95
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
You'll have no clue if I die.

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,600
It's not a good thing to know too much.

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,640
It's not a good thing

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,040
for a fool to know too much.

99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
But I'm not a fool.

100
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
I can help you.

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,640
You

102
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,240
can help me?

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Yes.

104
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
When you returned to the mansion,

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,480
you must have guessed that the murderer

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
is the one around you.

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm in the back house

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
and I'm with you.

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
Isn't it good for me to be your spy?

110
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Spy?

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
You even calculated me.

112
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,560
How could I believe you?

113
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
You're not worth the trust.

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
In that case,

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
I don't need you to interfere in my business.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
You'll get hurt if you don't do it.

117
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,600
Turn around.

118
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,880
What for?

119
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,640
You can't reach your back.

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,800
Let me help you.

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
No need.

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,320
I'll blind my eyes and not look at you.

123
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520
It's okay, right?

124
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,360
You're my husband and wife.

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Why should I be afraid of you?

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,080
You...

127
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
You're a woman.

128
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
When I'm really dead,

129
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,840
who would care about that?

130
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,020
My powered realtà doesn't tell if I have been in the past.

131
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,840
As if the end will never end.

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
Heartaches?

133
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,560
Why doesn't it hurt when you hit someone on the beach?

134
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm asking about the other things.

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
Does it still hurt?

136
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,520
General, you fought on the battlefield.

137
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,240
Does the wound you got hurt

138
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,280
still hurt?

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
The wound is already a month old.

140
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,680
It's painful and harsh.

141
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,560
But these wounds

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
will heal sooner or later.

143
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,360
Right?

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,880
General,

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
is it the night?

146
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,920
Yes.

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,200
It's the night.

148
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,920
Yao Chu is still injured.

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,400
General, please go back to the study tonight.

150
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
Okay.

151
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
Wish you a good recovery.

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,880
The

153
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,160
Yunxi.

154
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,840
Mother.

155
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Yunxi.

156
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Yunxi.

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,040
Yunxi.

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,080
The antidote.

159
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,960
The antidote.

160
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Give me the antidote.

161
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,360
The antidote is out.

162
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,600
The antidote is hidden.

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
You have to lock me up.

164
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,040
I can't find you.

165
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,440
You're useless.

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
You're useless.

167
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,280
Mother.

168
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,360
What should we do now?

169
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
When...

170
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,320
When time passes,

171
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,280
your father will be angry.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,640
I'll recover my face.

173
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
I'll beg him again.

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Your father will forgive me.

175
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,120
Mother.

176
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,320
What else can I do for you?

177
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Kill him.

178
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,320
Mother, I brought...

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,840
Mother.

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Yunxi.

181
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
No, I didn't mean to kill her.

182
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,400
Then why are you here?

183
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,040
I think...

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll kill you!

185
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,920
Brother,

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
why are you so interested in

188
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,360
coming to Anqi Talisman with me today?

189
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,640
I'm here for nothing.

190
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm just here for a walk.

191
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,520
Why didn't you ask your sister-in-law to come with you?

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
How did you know she wasn't here?

193
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
Stop!

194
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,480
It's her voice.

195
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
Shen Yunxi, stop!

196
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,040
Sister-in-law.

197
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
Don't come close!

198
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,160
If you come closer, I'll kill her.

199
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Let go of Wan'er first.

200
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,640
What's going on?

201
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,600
Shen Yunxi.

202
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,120
She killed my mother.

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
I didn't kill her. It wasn't me.

204
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,360
Brother.

205
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Brother, help me.

206
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,280
Brother.

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,160
What did I do wrong?

208
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,160
You're not as good as me

209
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
because you're pregnant.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,760
I can only be a virgin.

211
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,320
Why do you have to blame me?

212
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,600
My mother is now

213
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
being framed by you.

214
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,960
You can't get away with it.

215
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,720
Brother.

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,440
Are you all right?

217
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm fine.

218
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,800
It was like this.

219
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,560
What do you mean?

220
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,520
What did you say?

221
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,840
What do you mean?

222
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,960
What are you laughing at?

223
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm laughing at you.

224
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
What do you mean?

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,880
Shen Yunxi, what do you mean?

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,360
Do you think I really killed you?

227
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
I killed you.

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,840
You'll never know.

229
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,200
Shen Yunxi, talk to me.

230
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
You can't die.

231
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,280
Talk to me.

232
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,160
Get up.

233
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,600
Talk to me.

234
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,020
Subbers Alina, Sonia, TokI K

235
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,920
Short Video

236
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,900
Real Love

237
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Your reality has gone ahh

238
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,120
See you again

239
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,720
Right here

240
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,560
We performers paled by the gifts that are robbing us

241
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,120
At past, dreams made you potatoes

242
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,800
Although it was ember lasting, they can reach far

243
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,000
Getting broken is not enough to bring back so many spirit

244
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,720
My硦, my companions, I'm your pride

245
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,240
Whether the light of thousands of soldiers is on,

246
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm afraid.

247
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,280
Time has passed the years of memories.

248
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,120
Only you are the only one in the long night.

249
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,120
The regret I left behind

250
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,560
is buried in the bowl of you and me.

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,840
I touch a true heart and cross the mountain of heaven

252
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
just to return you a bowl of rice.

253
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:39,840
grit,
