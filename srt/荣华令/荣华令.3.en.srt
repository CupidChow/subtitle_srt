The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
General, I'm here to serve you.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
General, I'm here.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Only you?

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
General.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
General.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who are you?

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Who are you?

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who are you?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm the second wife, Tang Yizhu.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I just got married today.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who do you think I am?

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Madam, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You broke into my room without my permission.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You disturbed the night of the candle-waxing.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What should I do?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Just tell me.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why don't you go out?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, General.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Madam.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I didn't mean to disturb you and Madam.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's Aunt Qin.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She said you even hit Madam.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know what you're going to do.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was in a hurry.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's why I did it.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then I'll beg you.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You owe me a favor.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you, Madam.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
General, let's forget about it.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you, General.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're smart.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're using me as a favor.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You drove me out of the mansion on the wedding night.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You and I have a bad reputation.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're reasonable.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Behave yourself.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
General.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you going to leave with him?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Since you said you wanted to cooperate with me,

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I should see your ability.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll see how you'll deal with it tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There must be something wrong with Shen Yao Chu.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
General went to Shen Mansion today to overthrow the Shen family.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why did you change your plan?

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I thought I could overthrow Shen's family today.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I didn't expect he would be in such a situation.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If I don't let him in,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm afraid he can't survive.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This matter has already involved the Tang family and Qin family.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There's no need to involve a weak woman.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She's not weak.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Madam.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why are you here so late?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I heard that Madam Shen ran into Madam today.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was really worried.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So I came to see her.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your news is very clear.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The old marquis has been ill for three years.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have been working hard to take care of him.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm afraid he's not well.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The old marquis has been ill for three years.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You have been working hard to take care of him.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I admire you.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Madam.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are the model for the women in our house.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What do you want to say?

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I heard that today's matter was really angry.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shen's arrogance is unreasonable.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How dare he treat you like this?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I can't stand it.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a pity that

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm a concubine.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Shen's a concubine.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I have no filial piety.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I have no place to stay.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You should be more considerate for me.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If he made any mistakes

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and was kicked out of the mansion,

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I would be less worried.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will be considerate.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please rest assured.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll leave first.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Madam is here to greet you.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Greetings, Madam.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Shen's wife was kicked out.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Madam, please have some tea.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No hurry.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You haven't seen these two, have you?

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The second is Tang's family.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The third is Qin's family.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Although you are the main family,

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you are more stable than them.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You should learn from them from now on.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I heard that

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Jingchuan stayed in your room for only an hour yesterday.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is it true?

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
General said that

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
he had something important to do in the middle of the night.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So he went out.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you didn't serve him well,

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and let him leave,

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wouldn't blame you.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But such a big thing

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
can't be told.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why should I lie?

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know it well.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's hard to know.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The third is Tang's family.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Madam, please have a look.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The newlywed couple was not married.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How dare you

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
hide your unmarried life

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and marry into the Marquis' family.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't even care about our family.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Shen,

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
why are you explaining this?

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't need to explain it.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please find the general

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and share it with him.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I understand.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please find the general and share it with him.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Put the tea down.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Did I ask you to get up?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
General.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The general is here.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Madam, what do you want?

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
On your wedding night yesterday,

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Shen's soft-sleeved girl, Wu Ruohong,

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
was sentenced to death

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for this.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But she insisted on seeing you.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Tell me why.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This...

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Brother.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Xingwan.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Brother, you're alive.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Great, you're still alive.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I thought I would never see you again.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Brother.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's okay.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Waner,

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
look at you.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Greetings, Mother.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Didn't I ask you to pray in Guanyin Temple?

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why did you come back alone?

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I heard that you came back safely this morning.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I was so anxious.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So I couldn't help it.

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I came back without telling you.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Please forgive me.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Enough.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You are...

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sister-in-law?

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sister-in-law, you just got married.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Brother came back safely.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're so lucky.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Waner,

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
how dare you

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
stay by her side?

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Shen,

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I've called Jingchuan here.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Tell me.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you want to say?

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Madam, actually I...

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's wrong?

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've been kneeling for a long time.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm a little numb.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Get up.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let her explain it clearly.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Last night,

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I met you for the first time.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We were so close.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know I'm seriously injured.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's really hard for me.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But I couldn't stop my feelings.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you went out in the middle of the night.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm afraid you hurt me.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As for the handkerchief,

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
General said

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
it's our love token.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He took it with him.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I don't know

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
where it came from.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why did you frame me?

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I took it from your bed.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't talk nonsense.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Jingchuan,

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is what Shen said true?

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Well...

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is it true?

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Look at your arm.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is there a handkerchief in your arm?

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You said you'd take it with you.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You won't lie to me, will you?

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You didn't lie to me.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm really touched.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How could you

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
touch it?

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're not a bad person.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Throw it away.

208
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's our love token.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll keep it.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Enough.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's a small matter.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm tired.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can go back.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Wait.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You insulted me.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You said I was innocent.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you didn't love me

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and kept the handkerchief,

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be framed by my mother.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't.

221
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Madam.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
General.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He's mean to me.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You mean

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I joined hands with him

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and framed you?

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Madam.

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You should be responsible for me.

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Enough.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a misunderstanding.

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It almost made my daughter-in-law die.

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't let it go so easily.

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What do you want?

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I've just arrived at the Marquis's Mansion.

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm afraid others will say

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm treating them badly.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If I don't punish them severely,

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
others will say

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
it's because Madam was rude.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If that's the case,

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Madam Sun.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You'll kneel on the tomb

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
for five hours.

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Madam.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Madam.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's up to you.

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Madam.

250
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You can't leave me alone.

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Madam.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Sister-in-law.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You...

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Madam Sun.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Brother.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Kneel on the tomb.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you can stand up,

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we'll meet again.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Your eyes are like the winter flowers.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
When I look back from the clouds,

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll see you.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The wind and frost turn into dust.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In my dream, you're the one who changes.

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The wind blows deep and leaves deep feelings.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I've been alone for too long.

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I miss your hug and kiss.

267
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Does the light on the thousand-magnet lamp

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
shine for me?

269
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've been thinking about the years of our memories.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Only you are the warmth in the night.

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The memories I've kept.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
They'll be stored in our hearts.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll cross the sky with my heart.

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I only want to give you a kiss.

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll never give up on you.

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We'll grow old together.

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll never give up on you.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll never give up on you.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll never give up on you.

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll never give up on you.

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll never give up on you.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll never give up on you.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll never give up on you.
