Episode 16

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
After all this time,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
our lady must be hungry.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Feed her something good.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you have something to say, come at me.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't touch my mother.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Xie Siyi,

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
even if my mother dies,

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
my father will only care about her mother.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can't be a real woman in your life.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I almost forgot.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You can't get hurt.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're getting married.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Liu Ma.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mother.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Stop.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mother.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sisi.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mother.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sisi.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sisi.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Will you marry or not?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I will.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Easy to say.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Look.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your mother doesn't have to suffer this punishment.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's General Li, who has made a great contribution.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You married him to be a wife.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's the blessing you've been training for your whole life.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But he's a dead man.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you let me go,

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll go with him.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't marry,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
he's the one who's dead.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Xie Siyu,

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you're a bad person.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Aren't you afraid of being punished by Heaven?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Heaven?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The fate of this world

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is only in your hands.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm in your hands.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm in your mouth.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't blame others for being clumsy.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're just too thin.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's almost time.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Put on your makeup.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Xie Siyu.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If anything happens to my mother,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I won't let you go.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mother.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Father doesn't know about this.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You have to send that bitch out

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
while she's away.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But don't be nervous.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When did she care about this couple?

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're right.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But Shen Yaochu will have the right to leave home one day.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The right to leave?

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you think this girl

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
can survive tonight?

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's almost time.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now there's the son of the young general,

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Li Jingchuan,

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
who's coming back from the West.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The son of the young general,

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Shen Yaochu,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
who's coming back from the West.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I didn't treat you well

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
even though you married at night.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Look at this beautiful couple.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll be obedient

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
if you send my mother to Guanyin.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you offend the Li family,

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
my father won't forgive you.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll send her tomorrow.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's time.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You still want to bargain with me?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's time.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You don't have time

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to respond to the plan, do you?

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Xie Yiniang.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think it's almost time.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The wedding team of Li's Mansion

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is coming.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They're together in the yin and yang.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They'll live together forever.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They'll live together forever.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They'll live together forever.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll send her away now.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to see her go.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shen Yaochu.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't play with me.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You know

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
even if I don't kill her,

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can make her

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
die a terrible death.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Stop dawdling.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The wedding time is coming.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Li's Mansion

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I wish you and General Li

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
a happy marriage

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and a long-lasting friendship.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Xie Yiniang.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you want me to go with you,

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
we'll die together.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Madam.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Madam.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Help.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Someone's killed.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm Shen, the son of General Li.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you for stopping me.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please help me.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shen Yaochu.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mother.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When did I stop you from marrying?

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you for saving me.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who are you?

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm Xu Shen, General Li's father.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
General Xu?

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you for stopping me from marrying

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and making me marry someone else.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll try my best to escape.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Please take me away.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When did I stop you from marrying?

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It was you!

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hong.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are you so infatuated with General Li?

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Of course.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was lucky enough to see him many years ago.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll never forget that day.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I admire General Li for his contribution to the country.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Even if he's not here now,

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm willing to marry him.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You've seen him?

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of course.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Shen Yaochu.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're lying.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're the one who killed me.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, will you let me marry or not?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Of course I'll marry you.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Take me away.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Here comes the rain.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Please go to bed, Madam.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's time.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Madam, please go to bed.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Go to bed.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Even if he's in Li's Mansion,

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
he'll still be buried with General Li.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Mother, I wonder if Mother is safe.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't die.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If Xie Yiniang kills my mother,

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I won't waste my time.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't die.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
General Xu.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What's the matter, Madam?

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Please come in.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Madam.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I need to be treated by Guan Yinan's master.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Please send me to Guan Yinan.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll invite the doctor to Li's Mansion.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Please wait a moment.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you mean?

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll send you to Guan Yinan.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why do you want to go to Guan Yinan?

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I have my reasons.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How dare you!

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You've seen everything

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've done today.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't have to hide it from you.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So it's not that Xie Yiniang stopped you from marrying.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's that you don't want to marry.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Change the way.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Go to Guan Yinan.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Interesting.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have my own secret in Guan Yinan.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll make your heart first.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's go.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Your eyes melt into spring

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Look back at the cloud

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Dream of you

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The wind and frost on the way turn into dust

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You are the one who makes the dream come true

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The wind blows and leaves deep feelings

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Too many absurdities

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I miss you and hug you

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Is there a light in front of me?

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Light for me

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Time goes by and memories last

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Only you are a kind of warm spring

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The past is left behind

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Re-laying on the edge of you and me

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll set off a heart that crosses the mountain of heaven

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Just to return you a kiss

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I wish I could never let go of you

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And grow up in the middle of the world

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want to be with you

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I want to be with you

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I want to be with you

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I want to be with you

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I want to be with you

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I want to be with you

209
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I want to be with you

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I want to be with you

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I want to be with you

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I want to be with you

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I want to be with you

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to be with you

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I want to be with you

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I want to be with you
