00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When the sadness fades like a dream

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Flowers wither and fall, there's no way to make up for it

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sighing that this life is too short

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wish to cut off the thread of fate

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Snow falls, melting and fading

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Blame the fate for leaving me

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The color of love and hate

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The moment I love you

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Legend of Chusen

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Madam is just a little cold.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The rest is fine.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She won't wake up until now.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you, Doctor Zhang.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
General, you're welcome.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll go down and prescribe a prescription for Madam.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Luo, see her out.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're awake.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why do you say I'm still alive?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've calculated so much.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To save my mother's life,

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I should have done this today.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I should have buried with your doctor.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Maybe

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
my mother could still be alive.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So your life is not a life?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
My mother died.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's the point of me living?

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I just want to

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
live a normal life with my mother

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
after finding my sister.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why can't I do that?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why do I have to fight with my mother?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why can't I be obedient?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why can't I be the one now?

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yaoshu,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you have to live.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not as a daughter or a wife,

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but as a knife.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A knife that cuts all the injustice in the world.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You have to live.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have to avenge your mother.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've sent people to check the body.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The murderer may not be Shen Yunxi.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How did my mother die?

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The coroner has verified that

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
your mother was poisoned first

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and then cut by a knife.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What poison?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Phanxia poison.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This poison is from the Western Regions.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've sent people to Shen Yunxi's house.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I have to find someone

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
who killed your mother.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe someone else.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What are you doing?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
General.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a weak woman.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have no one.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have only one life.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you can help me

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
find out my mother's death,

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
my life is yours.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I promise you.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I promise you.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mother.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mother.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chuan.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mother.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Chuan, why are you here?

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mother.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go away.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Mother.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Go away.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mother.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Your father doesn't like you to see me.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go away.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mother.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mother.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They all said you were dying.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can't die.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't leave me alone.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Mother.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Chuan.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Listen to me.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can't give you anything now.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In this mansion,

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you must live well.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You must live a good life.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Otherwise,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you won't die.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mother.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mother.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mother.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mother.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
General.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have one more thing to ask.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
My mother's biggest regret

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is that she didn't find my sister, Shen Yun Ge.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please help me find her.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You have a sister?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But when she was still in the fortress,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Xie Siyu sold her to a mute.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,500
She still has no silver

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and there is a birthmark

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
on her left shoulder.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a flower pattern.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
My mother carved this jade pendant for her.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's the same shape as her birthmark.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I just don't know

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
whether she is still alive.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll help you find her.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you, General.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it true?

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I just sent someone to inquire.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Not only Shen's mother was killed,

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but also her third sister was injured.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But Shen's family

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is so embarrassing now.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Such a family

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is really ungrateful.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're right.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But now,

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Jing Chuan is very protective of her.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry for your loss, General.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll try my best.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll try my best.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Never mind.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When a man is in love,

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
he's usually blind.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But the house

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
is still the world of women.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Jing Chuan will leave the palace

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in a few days.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're leaving again?

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm tired recently.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't take care of these things.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll give you the power of the steward.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You should also practice.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Really?

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you, Madam.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I...

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I won't let you down.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll get ready.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Stupid.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Madam,

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Madam didn't want to see you,

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but she came to see you.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's the point?

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now,

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't get your happiness,

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
nor Madam's.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How can I live in this huge mansion

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
in the future?

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Madam.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What did you bring?

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Who died?

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who died?

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing?

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Tell me.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who's going to die?

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or Madam?

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Who died?

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let me go.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Who died?

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You can't fight me after all.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're not dead.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Your mother

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
died.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Shen Yaochu.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You made me like this.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I couldn't protect your mother.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You lost.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Even if the general is protecting you,

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
you can't beat me.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You gave Shen Yunxi the poison.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What poison?

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yunxi?

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Where is Yunxi?

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where is Yunxi?

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Your mother died of poisoning.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You asked me to use the antidote.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Tell me where Yunxi is.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll give you the antidote.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not you.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not me.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's me.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I killed him.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It has nothing to do with Yunxi.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I killed him.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Where did you send my sister?

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Your sister?

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You want to find your sister?

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Ah.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Back then.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I sent her to the police station.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Guess.

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Guess what she's like now.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Shen Yaochu.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Now you take me back to the mansion.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
As your mother,

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll tell you where the girl is.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How is it?

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You don't go.

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't go.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tell me.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Where is Yunxi?

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Right.

218
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Shen Yunxi assassinated the head of the army.

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He kidnapped the three young ladies of the mansion.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He was killed in the city.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
No.

222
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No.

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Impossible.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
