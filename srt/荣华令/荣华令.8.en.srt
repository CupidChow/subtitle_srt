The Legend of Chusen

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When the sadness fades like a dream

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the blood is all wet, there's no way to heal it

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sighing that this life is too short, I'm willing to be separated from you

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You imagine that

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Snow falls like meteorites

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,780
Blame others for values of Bro和Yan

Episode 18

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Your Ladyship,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
you haven't recovered yet.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
You should go to bed and rest.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,000
It's all right.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,400
Your Ladyship,

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
I heard that

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Mother Sun knelt down before.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Her Ladyship,

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
because she had served her for years,

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
gave her some food and sent her out of the mansion.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But who knew that

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
she met bandits on the road?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
She died on the road?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,400
All the thoughts and feelings are the cause.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
What we are suffering now are the consequences.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,800
People used to be swords,

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
I was fish.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Now I want them to taste

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
the taste of the deep.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Your Ladyship.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I have military affairs to attend to.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
I have to leave home tomorrow.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
I've sent someone to check the poison.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Take care of yourself.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Thank you, General.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
General,

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
let me serve you to rest.

38
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,400
No need.

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't want you to beg for help.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm not interested in such a relationship.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll help you.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,800
I have my own reason.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't feel wronged.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm your wife.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Besides, I think you're right.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
From now on,

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
I should live for myself.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,800
What do you want me to do?

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
I want to be the head of the family.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,960
The

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Nuo'er.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Nuo'er.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Your Ladyship.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Where did you get the medicine?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
The fire was made by the servants.

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
What's wrong, Your Ladyship?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A bowl of grass and water.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
And a fanxie.

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Your Ladyship hasn't recovered yet.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
How dare they do this?

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll go find them now.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,600
I came to send money and charcoal to you.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Wait.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
The profit per month is 20 taels.

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Why is it only 10 taels

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,200
when it comes to you?

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm also

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
doing as Qiyi's order.

69
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
What about coal?

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
According to the rules,

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
the most top-grade

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
silver and bone charcoal

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
should be in your room.

74
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
How can you use

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
the black charcoal on the altar?

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Besides, it's less than a catty.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not enough to burn for a day.

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Your Ladyship,

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
there's only black charcoal in the mansion.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
And when the charcoal was just burned,

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
it was less.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
If you're not satisfied,

83
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
you can go to Qiyi.

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,800
We'll do as you say.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
By the way, Your Ladyship,

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
you know it's cold outside.

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Don't go outside.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Stop right there!

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Come back.

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Your Ladyship,

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Qiyi is really too much.

92
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,200
They clearly

93
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
want to break your body.

94
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
The more you go too far, the better.

95
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
You'll be bitten by a dog.

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Your Ladyship,

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
how much is it?

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
It's ten taels a month.

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,400
Even if we drink porridge and eat salty food every day,

100
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
it's ten taels a month.

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Plus, it's made from rouge and water.

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
It's enough for daily use.

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
Ten taels a month

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
is not enough.

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Qiyi is too much

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
after being scolded by Her Ladyship.

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
You're a concubine.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
How can you suffer like this?

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm telling you.

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
I heard that it's not easy for Her Ladyship to live here.

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
She can live in this mansion.

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
She can't live here.

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
She can't live here.

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
She can't live here.

115
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
It's already good enough

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
to live in this mansion.

117
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Then...

118
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Then we can't only eat steamed buns and salty food.

119
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,400
General is not at home.

120
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,200
How about

121
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,200
you go talk to Her Ladyship?

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Her Ladyship doesn't even see me.

123
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
How can I talk to her?

124
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Xiaoru,

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I have some precious rouge and water in my dowry.

126
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
You can take it all.

127
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Qiyi,

128
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
we don't need to

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
take your dowry.

130
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Yes.

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't need it.

132
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Ladyship, why are you here?

133
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
I'll tell you the truth.

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I've been here for a while.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Then what I just said

136
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
was all heard by you?

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't worry.

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Sit down and talk.

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
I'd better not sit down.

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,200
You're quite good at math.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
I often helped my father

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
to look at the accounts when I was in my mother's house.

143
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,000
I can do this.

144
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
I can do this.

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
Then can you do me a favor?

146
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
It's also for yourself.

147
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
What do you want me to do?

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Today is not the day

149
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,000
when the moon rises in the mansion.

150
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
Why are you here so early

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
to greet me?

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
I just thought of a way

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
to choose some managers

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
among the servants

155
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
and give them

156
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
the money.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
In this way,

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
not only will it be more efficient,

159
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
but also more convenient

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
for daily management.

161
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
I didn't choose the wrong person

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
when you handled this matter.

163
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a bit too early

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
for you to say that.

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Shen Shi,

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
what do you mean by that?

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Your Ladyship,

168
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
I know that you want me to manage

169
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
the mansion, but you are not satisfied.

170
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,000
But

171
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,200
you can't talk to me like this.

172
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Mrs. Qin,

173
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
you'd better read these first

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
before you blame yourself.

175
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Sister-in-law, what's wrong with them?

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Mr. Zhang,

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
on the ninth day of last month,

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
you brought the female officer of Hongxiu House

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
back to the mansion.

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
She left the palace at noon the next day.

181
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Yesterday,

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
she broke a pot of iron tree with wine.

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Sun Bao'er,

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,200
on the thirteenth day of last month,

185
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
she broke the glass bottle of liulipen

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
and found someone to stick it on the bottle.

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
She was so happy.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Tang Xiaowan,

189
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
she asked the guests to buy some gifts

190
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
and secretly sold them to the city.

191
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Your Ladyship,

192
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I dare not do it again.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Actually, these things

194
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
can be discovered by a little bit of attention.

195
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
I thought Mrs. Qin

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,600
was going to settle the score in the autumn.

197
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I didn't expect

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
these people were not punished,

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
but were promoted.

200
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Your Ladyship,

201
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
I don't know about these things.

202
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
If I knew they made a mistake,

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
I wouldn't have let them get married.

204
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Really?

205
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
Then the Yin and Yang accounts

206
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
are also made by the servants?

207
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Show me.

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,200
The Yin and Yang accounts are also made by the servants?

209
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
After Mrs. Qin became a midwife,

210
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,800
the servants in the mansion all had a higher salary.

211
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
According to the accounts,

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
the Li family's salary

213
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,800
is 116 taels per month,

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
even the lowest government official

215
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
has one tael of salary per month.

216
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
But I asked them.

217
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Madam,

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,680
I did only pay three thousand yuan.

220
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
I thought I did something wrong.

221
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
But after asking around, I found out

222
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,880
that someone had deducted my money.

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Please punish them

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
and get justice for me.

225
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
Madam, please investigate it carefully.

226
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,040
I did deduct money

227
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,120
from the money I spent on the things in the mansion.

228
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,600
I didn't deduct money either.

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
I did it according to Madam Qi's order.

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240
I can pay you back.

231
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,080
It's not bad at all.

232
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
According to what you said,

233
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,360
the mansion has more than 1,700 taels of silver.

234
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Now there are less than 700 taels left on the account.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,160
If you didn't do it,

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
who would have used the 1,000 taels of silver?

237
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,920
Who else could it be?

238
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
You deliberately promoted the wrong person to be the manager.

239
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,480
Isn't it just to make them

240
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
do what you want?

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,040
Don't slander them.

242
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,080
Hmph.

243
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
The rules of the Li family

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,520
are that the one who pays the money

245
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,040
will be sent to jail.

246
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
Please

247
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
be wise.

248
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
Madam, please be wise.

249
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,080
You can go to my room and investigate it.

250
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,840
If I really

251
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,040
took the 1,000 taels of silver,

252
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,440
there must be evidence in the room.

253
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,000
The

254
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The

259
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Sister, you're still wise.

263
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,480
Otherwise,

264
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
we would have been in trouble.

265
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,040
He's a good man.

266
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,960
He's always wrong.

267
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,120
Of course it's easy to investigate.

268
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
But

269
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,000
it's a good thing that you're a good account.

270
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Otherwise,

271
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,240
it's not that easy for us to solve this matter.

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,200
You're overpraising me.

273
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,320
But

274
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
Madam didn't punish her.

275
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
Is she trying to solve this matter?

276
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,640
We haven't found the 1,000 taels of silver

277
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
that she stole.

278
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
There's no evidence to prove

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,360
that it was from Concubine Qin.

280
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
I have to think of something.

281
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,360
Concubine Qin looks weak on the surface.

282
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,760
I didn't expect her to be so cruel.

283
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
With her temper,

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,840
I don't think it's easy to solve this matter.

285
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:44,600
mighty

286
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,080
Sir,

287
00:11:46,200 --> 00:12:10,040
we've cleared the

288
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,240
Hey, little beauty, don't run away.

289
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Just obey me.

290
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,600
Isn't there a boat?

291
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Oh, a beauty can play.

292
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,560
I'm coming.

293
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,360
Ah!

294
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
Ah!

295
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,640
Beware of fire.

296
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Beware of fire.

297
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,240
You can't even control a woman?

298
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,760
Nonsense.

299
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Who knows this woman is so fierce?

300
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I stole it.

301
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,520
You have to pay me more.

302
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,360
I can pay you more.

303
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,520
But you have to play another show for me.

304
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm not going to play with you.

305
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm going to play with you.

306
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm going to play with you.

307
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm going to play with you.

308
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm going to play with you.

309
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm going to play with you.

310
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm going to play with you.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,280
I'm going to play with you.

312
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm going to play with you.

313
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm going to play with you.

314
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm going to play with you.

315
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm going to play with you.

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm going to play with you.

317
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm going to play with you.

318
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm going to play with you.

319
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm going to play with you.

320
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm going to play with you.

321
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm going to play with you.

322
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm going to play with you.

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm going to play with you.

I'm going to play with you.

I'm going to play with you.

I'm going to play with you.

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
I'm going to play with you.

328
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I'm going to play with you.

329
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I'm going to play with you.

330
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm going to play with you.

331
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm going to play with you.

I'm going to play with you.
