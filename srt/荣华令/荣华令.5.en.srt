00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Isn't this General's wife?

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What?

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
General Li didn't come back with you?

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
General has work to do.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He might be late.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't think General Li wants to come.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He's not with you on the day of your return.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Even if you marry General,

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you won't have a good life.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm also a concubine.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The child is also the enemy.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This will not change no matter what.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Am I right, Mrs. Xie?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's really different

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to have a wife.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Since General didn't come today,

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it's our family feast.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've prepared a special dish

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for you.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Come in and have a try.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You don't even dare to come back?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hope that letter

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
can be sent to Li Jingchuan.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where is General?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
General went to train soldiers outside the city early in the morning.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then you can wait at home.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When he comes back,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
give this letter to him.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you like

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the gift I prepared for you?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Here.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Here.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Chicken leg.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mom.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mom, this...

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yao Chu,

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you haven't told me

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
whether you like

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
this gift.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xie Siyu,

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not going to tell you.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Xie Siyu,

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
why is my mom here?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When you come back,

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
your mom will be here.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Xie Siyu,

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
how dare you do this to my mom?

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you again?

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If Li Jingchuan didn't come back,

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the wedding night would be your death day.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now the husband is not happy,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the mother is not lucky.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Only a crazy mother like you

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
dares to laugh at me.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You think there's no one in the Commandery Prince's Mansion?

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's almost time.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's almost time?

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mom.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Mom.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're so vicious.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What did you do to my mom?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I didn't have a back-up,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wouldn't have forced you to save the criminal.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is the medicine I got.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It won't hurt anyone.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It will only make people

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
feel pain and pain.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mom.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can't die,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but you can't live.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Even if I'm alone now,

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm the wife of General Youge.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How dare you touch me?

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of course I won't touch you.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll let you do it yourself.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let her go.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The antidote is with me.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I'm happy,

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll give her the antidote.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Kneel down.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Mom.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Kneel down.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mom.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mom.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mom.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You brat.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How dare you

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
scare me

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
with the title of General's wife?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Come here.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Give me the pen.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you doing?

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want you to write down

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the confession letter.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Admit that you're rude,

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
rude, ungrateful,

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and even malicious.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't deserve to be the General's wife.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You want to cut your hair and become a slave.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You want to leave Jingchuan

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and divorce.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So the heart of a loving mother

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is also faked.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You have a good place to go.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can't live in the capital.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a good place to go.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You don't care about your mother's death.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If so,

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the antidote...

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My sister.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
My sister.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mom.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Gun.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
General.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Today is the return day of the wife.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Aren't you going?

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This morning,

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the Shen Mansion sent someone

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to pick Mrs. Shen up.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
After all, when the wife returned...

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You mean Mrs. Shen was taken back?

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, no.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shen Yaochu.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Write it down.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You'll be more tired

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and your mother will be more upset.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Master.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Master.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Dad.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're back.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Dad.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You called me back in such a hurry.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is it just to watch

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
such a drama?

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Master, I...

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Dad.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mrs. Shen married me to Li's Mansion

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
while you were away.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She was divorced.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now she's torturing my mother like this.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Dad.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please save my mother.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Master.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mr. Shen.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Shen is also

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
doing this for the Shen Family.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I know it.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Dad.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The antidote is in her hand.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
My mother is weak.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She can't stand this torture.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She's crazy.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Master, let go.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Master.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Master.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
She's crazy.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think she's crazy

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because she's with Madam.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If she's crazy in Li's Mansion,

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
how can we explain it?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why don't we

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
keep her here

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and tell the world

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that she's having a sudden attack.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We won't

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
get caught up in this.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Master.

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Master.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Master.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Master.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Master.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OK.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Shen Zhen.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The blood dog knows you're here.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let go of the concubine

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and kill her.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're going to

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
ruin your own family.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You...

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're a father.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Shut her mouth.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes.

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go down and wait for me.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When I'm done,

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll send her

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
to you.

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let go of her.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mother.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
General Li.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mother.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Madam.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
General Li.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why are you here?

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My wife's mother

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is here.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What's wrong with you?

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm fine.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm fine.

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why are you here?

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to

210
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
visit my wife.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But I came late.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I saw my wife

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
being humiliated

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
in her mother's house.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Mother.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You said General Li

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
didn't like her.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How could it be?

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
General Li

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is the son-in-law of the Shen family.

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But this is our family matter.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Please don't misunderstand.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why don't you drink some tea?

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You're not the one who should talk.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Lord Shen.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You treated

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
your wife and daughter

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
with respect.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is this

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the rule of the Shen family?

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No.

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Open the cage.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hurry up.

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mother.

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Lord Shen.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm waiting for your explanation.

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is...

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let me explain.

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Madam Xie sent me

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to the Li family for a marriage.

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I wanted to sell

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
my affection to the Li family.

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I could get rid of

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
my daughter.

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Am I right?

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Lord Shen.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I...

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I did it for the sake of

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the Shen family.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I...

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Since my sister went missing,

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you gave my mother

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
an incurable drug.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You locked us

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
in the backyard.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You didn't even

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
give us a bite.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm just a child.

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm a maid.

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm not good at keeping guard.

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm a beggar.

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I used my mother's dowry

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
to get an incurable drug.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Shen Cheng'an.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you're not blind

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
or a fool,

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
you should know

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that we're not

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
as poor as dogs.

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Come on.

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your Majesty.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
His Majesty is in love with you.

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Lord Shen treated his daughter

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
so badly.

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He's really a bad man.

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you still want

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to be the head of the army?

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
General.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm confused.

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I heard

281
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what the poisoner said.

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I hope you...

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I hope you can

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
help me

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to tell His Majesty

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
about the incident.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tell me

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
how to deal with it.

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
My Lord.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've been guarding the Shen Family

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
for more than 20 years.

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I even gave birth to Yunxi for you.

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can't be so cruel to me.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, Father.

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You can punish me.

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't punish my mother.

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You kicked Xie's family

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
out of the Shen Mansion

299
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and locked the second lady

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
in the backyard.

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Without my order,

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
you can't go out.

303
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
My Lord.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Father.

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I was wrong.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait.

307
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Isn't the punishment too light?

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Madam.

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You decide.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You want me to decide?

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Xie's family committed many crimes.

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They made trouble.

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's all because of his good mouth.

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You little bitch.

315
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Shut up.

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Lord Shen.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Slap Xie's family

318
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
100 times.

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No.

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Xu Shan, wake up.

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Lord Shen,

323
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
wake up.

324
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I...

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
My Lord.

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't be afraid, Mother.

327
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't hit my mother.

328
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't hit my mother.

329
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Li Dazhu.

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
General Li.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
General Li.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Shen Yaochu.

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Shen Yaochu.

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let my mother go.

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Shen Yaochu.

336
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mother.

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Mother.

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you okay?

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's okay.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We can let her go.

341
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No.

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Xie Siyu.

343
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Xie Siyu.

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
When you made these mistakes,

345
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
have you ever thought

346
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that you would be repaid

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
for these tricks one day?

348
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I won't kill you.

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I will add you

350
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to the pain

351
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
of our mothers.

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I will give you back one by one.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mother.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Mother, are you okay?

355
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Mother.

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you okay, Mother?

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Take your mother away.

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Slow down, Mother.

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Slow down, Mother.

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yaochu.

361
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Since you are out of breath,

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
then you and...

363
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You and General Li

364
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
stay here

365
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and have lunch.

366
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Shen Cheng'an.

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
From now on,

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we will live or die.

369
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It has nothing to do with your Shen Mansion.

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The wind blows in the way,

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and the flowers turn into dust.

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I became serious

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
because of you.

374
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The wind blows,

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and the leaves grow.

376
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Even if I'm alone,

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I have so many dreams.

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I miss you,

379
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and I want to hug you.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you have

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
thousands of lights

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to light up my life?

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Time has passed

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and memories have been lost.

385
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Only you

386
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
are in the long night.

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The regret

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I left behind

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
is buried in our foreheads.

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I touch a heart

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
that has crossed the mountain of heaven

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
just to give you a kiss.

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I wish to stay with you

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and grow old with you.
