The Legend of Chusen

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Episode 19

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Go.

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,920
Your Ladyship,

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
the Li family is here.

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,560
I can't go in.

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,400
I can't live in there.

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,600
General Li won't let you die.

9
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,920
Please.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Stop.

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,320
Stop.

12
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,480
Are you Shen Shi?

13
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,440
Yes.

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm Shen Yao Chu,

15
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,680
the eldest daughter of the Commandery Prince.

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
How dare you!

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Now you're in my Li family.

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
You can only call yourself Shen Shi.

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,280
May I ask you something?

20
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,680
I've been serving you.

21
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,520
Can you call me Ma Ma?

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
You're a servant.

23
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm getting married to General today.

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,520
You sent a servant to welcome me here?

25
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,600
You're not feeling well.

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,440
I'll welcome you on behalf of you.

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Since you're in my Li family,

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
you should follow the rules of my family.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,760
You came from outside the mansion.

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,360
You're covered in filth.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,160
Please take off your shoes

32
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
and cross the fire.

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,200
Only then can you get rid of the filth.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,240
Take off your shoes and cross the fire?

35
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Your Ladyship, please.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
General Li has donated his life for the country.

37
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,480
He didn't even return home.

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
None of you in the Li family

39
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,400
came to welcome him.

40
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,800
You even embarrassed his wife.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,760
What kind of behavior is this?

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
How dare you!

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
This is the rule of the Li family.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
How dare you!

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
How could you become the official sis of the Li family?

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,560
Yes, I'm well-behaved.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Your family will marry someone else.

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,480
Men!

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,160
Your Kreash is insisting evil.

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,600
lowering his shoes and climbing up foyer

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,760
and taking off his clothes.

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,600
Emu Emu Emu Emu Emu Emu.

53
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Emu Emu Emu Emu Emu.

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
What are you arguing about?

55
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,800
Ha ha ha ha.

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Where's the stdep?

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Good.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
Your Ladyship,

59
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,160
Xinfu is defiant.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
He's reckless.

61
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,420
I am

62
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,880
mourning for her.

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
Should I make it or not?

64
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,080
It's lucky to have

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
Zhen Barr dismissed by you.

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,060
I now celebrate

67
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,740
be sad,

68
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,900
proud and reporting reach and die.

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,980
Take橋 together,

70
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
for mourning and burial!

71
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,940
I can't die.

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,660
Prime Minister is immediately cremated

73
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,860
to honor King Council

74
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,780
in order to honor Li Byun젠 ofâtá.

75
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,660
Wait and see

76
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,860
for what executing세

77
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,780
Lady Yacht,

78
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,420
how dare you PE taste wáet me?

79
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,220
What's wrong ?

80
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,740
How dare you?!

81
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:32,940
YouKO General lord

82
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:46,100
please

83
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,060
I

84
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,660
I've lived here for over 80 years.

85
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,660
I can't make things even worse for myself.

86
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:01,540
Master Jing in front of Wanyuan

87
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,380
couldn't have kept save his Royal Father.

88
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,980
I am seriously impacted by this.

89
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,420
No wonder Ziyu didn't Popcorn this board.

90
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,540
He's Li Jingzhua.

91
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,460
Why don't you

92
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,900
greet the old lady?

93
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,420
How dare you!

94
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,780
How dare you disrespect the general!

95
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,020
Old lady,

96
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,780
do you think I need to kneel?

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,460
We are mother and son.

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,340
Of course, we don't need to be so polite.

99
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,700
But since ancient times,

100
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,580
the late emperor and the late emperor were always the father and son.

101
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,940
According to the etiquette of the five dynasties,

102
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,500
should the old lady

103
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,060
kneel to me first?

104
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,380
Just kidding.

105
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,100
Why does the old lady take it seriously?

106
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,860
I heard that Miss Shen asked me to die in battle.

107
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,940
I felt so sad.

108
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,100
She wanted to die with me.

109
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,700
Miss Shen is so devoted to me.

110
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,820
It's really touching.

111
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,940
I said

112
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,300
General Li wouldn't let you die.

113
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,540
Thank you for marrying me.

114
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,620
The coffin is placed in the courtyard.

115
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,780
It's really not a good time.

116
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,180
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,220
I'll let you go.

126
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,940
Stop crying. It's so annoying.

127
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,420
Sister Tang.

128
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,060
We've waited for you for two years.

129
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,780
But who knows

130
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,260
you're dead.

131
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,660
Then we'll have to

132
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,620
stay in the Marquis' Mansion forever.

133
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,940
If he's dead, we'll leave the Marquis' Mansion.

134
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,900
The world is so wide.

135
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,380
Can't we accommodate two women?

136
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,140
But we're married.

137
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,780
We can't stay here.

138
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
Sister.

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,540
General is not dead.

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,500
What? What did you say?

141
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,460
Why can't I hear it?

142
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Sister.

143
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,060
General is not dead.

144
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
General is back.

145
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,260
General is not dead.

146
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,860
General is still alive.

147
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,220
He's not dead. Why are you crying?

148
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm happy.

149
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,260
But I'm still a little sad.

150
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Why?

151
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
Sister, think about it.

152
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,420
Today, Madam

153
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,700
married General for a good reason.

154
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,460
She thought she was here to die.

155
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,540
But since General is back at this time,

156
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
tonight

157
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,980
will be their

158
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,660
wedding night?

159
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,660
What else?

160
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,700
We've waited for General for two years.

161
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,260
Even if we're going to have a wedding night,

162
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,020
we should have a first-come, first-served.

163
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,860
But the interrogation is a serious matter.

164
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,140
We should have a first-come, first-served.

165
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,220
You're right.

166
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
It's over.

167
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,180
Can I go now?

168
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,580
It's not over yet.

169
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Tomorrow morning,

170
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,740
you have to greet Madam.

171
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
General.

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,300
Today is our wedding night.

173
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,740
If you don't stay,

174
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,740
how can I explain to Madam tomorrow?

175
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,300
What do you want?

176
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,700
Let's make a deal.

177
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,980
Tell me.

178
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,020
His Majesty

179
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,060
is the most important family member of the family.

180
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,340
He's filial.

181
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,460
So Madam has sacrificed so many concubines.

182
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,300
She wants to marry you

183
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,740
and stop the gossip.

184
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,660
But today,

185
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,300
I see the differences between you and your son.

186
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,100
I heard that before General returned,

187
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,340
he married a concubine for you.

188
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,460
I'm afraid the house is not safe.

189
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,820
If the house is not peaceful

190
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,380
and the Emperor is shocked,

191
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,460
it's not a good thing.

192
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Sister.

193
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,540
Shicai and Xiao Cui told me

194
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,140
that Shen Shi

195
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
is going to meet Madam

196
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,500
in the hall today.

197
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,420
If he plays the role of general tonight,

198
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,740
we'll play the role of you and me.

199
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,900
We'll use some tricks

200
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,460
to trap General's heart.

201
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,820
You and I

202
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,340
are going to have a stupid mistress.

203
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,260
What are we going to do

204
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,980
in the future?

205
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
Sister, wait.

206
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,300
I have an emergency.

207
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,580
You go to sleep first.

208
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,860
Have some melon seeds.

209
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,820
I have an emergency. I'll go out first.

210
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Idiot.

211
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,900
I'm here to replace the house of General.

212
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,180
You're here to protect Guan Yi'an, right?

213
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,540
Who is Guan Yi'an to you

214
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,660
that you care so much about?

215
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,700
Mother.

216
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
All right.

218
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,380
I'll think about it.

219
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,620
But don't make any trouble.

220
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,740
It's not impossible

221
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,140
to have your mother

222
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,500
to be with you every day

223
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,340
when I have a child.

224
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
General.

225
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,140
It's useless for me

226
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,260
to work hard alone

227
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,900
and you have to do something.

228
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,300
You're a woman.

229
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
You're too bold.

230
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,540
What you said is not true.

231
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,540
Even if someone did hit me,

232
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,780
I don't mean bad thing to you.

233
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,140
That's not true.

234
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm here to face her

235
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,300
to protect my mother.

236
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,740
It's not impossible.

237
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:13,380
Do you have the light of the thousand-year-old?

238
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,380
Time has passed the years of memory

239
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,380
Only you are the only one in the long night

240
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,380
The regret left by the past

241
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,380
The end is in the end of you and me

242
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,380
I touch a true heart across the sky

243
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,380
Just to give you a kiss

244
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:40,380
I wish to stay with you forever
