00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,200
General.

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Mom Sun touched her hand and feet on the pot.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,400
Didn't you say last night

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,200
that you'd see how I'd deal with it?

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Are you satisfied with the result?

9
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Is that why you...

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the right

11
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,520
to negotiate with you.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,680
Can you help me now?

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,720
Fine.

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,120
I promise to protect your mother.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,720
Thank you, General.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
But if you're exhausted,

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,880
how can you comfort her?

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,720
You've been fighting outside for years.

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,480
You don't know the way to deal with the poison.

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
If I need your help every time,

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,800
how can I help you with the internal battle?

22
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Let's go.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
I'll take you back.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,080
You're in the play.

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,000
A couple is meant to comfort their wives.

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
You don't have to worry about it.

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Shen Yaochu.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
You're not a good woman.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,200
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Here.

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,560
Fine.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,040
As you wish.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you for your concern.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
How could I not know

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
about the dirty and evil things

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
in the back house?

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,440
Li Jingchuan

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,880
is torturing me

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,440
and trying to be a good person.

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,440
There's really no good person in this mansion.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,280
Sister-in-law.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
May I come in?

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Come in.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Sister-in-law.

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
Your knee is badly injured, right?

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
Let me send you some medicine.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
I...

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,240
I...

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,720
Sister-in-law.

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,000
You're really strong.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,560
It hurts so much.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,880
You have to bear it.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,160
Mother Sun has been with Mother for many years.

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,120
She has always been very fond of her.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,240
So Mother doesn't really care

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,000
about her sinister tricks.

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,040
Today,

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
you punished Mother Sun

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
for me...

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
For those who

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,720
suffered from her evil tricks.

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
Has she treated you like that?

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,200
Aren't you the First Miss of the Li Mansion?

64
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,600
How could she dare...

65
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Third Sister.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
How could she dare...

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
Sister-in-law, you may not know that

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,480
I was adopted by the Li Mansion.

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
If I hadn't been given a meal by the Li family,

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,040
I would have starved to death on the street.

71
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
So these things

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
are nothing to me.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
I've been best friends with my brother since I was a child.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
If he likes you,

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
I like you too.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Sister-in-law.

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Can I come to you often in the future?

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Of course.

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm here to see you.

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,120
It seems that Li Jingchuan

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,120
is a good man.

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,400
What did you say?

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
Li Jingchuan is still alive?

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,160
He's back?

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes.

86
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,960
Today, the banquet of the mansion

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
is held by General Li.

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
So

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,160
Shen Yao Chu is still alive?

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
You may leave.

91
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,520
Yes.

92
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Mother.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,560
Mother.

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
What should we do? Shen Yao Chu is still alive.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
She's become General's wife.

96
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,280
If she asks General Li to come back to take revenge on us,

97
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
we... we...

98
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,400
Don't panic.

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
Li Jingchuan

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,120
can destroy our mansion.

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,200
But if I were to marry him,

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,320
I would be General's wife.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
You're silly.

104
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
Mother.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,960
Are you going to marry him and die with him?

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,960
Isn't Li Jingchuan still alive?

107
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,320
What's the point of marrying him?

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Li Jingchuan is not the wife of the old lady.

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,800
If he hadn't left the mansion to join the army,

110
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,960
he would have died.

111
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,040
But he's in a high position now.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,680
What if Shen Yao Chu comes back to take revenge on us?

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Now,

114
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,760
write to your father

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
and tell him to come back as soon as possible.

116
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Tell him that there's an emergency at home.

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,320
I think he should stop searching.

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,160
Go.

119
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,080
Okay.

120
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
Shen Yao Chu.

121
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Shen Yao Chu.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,520
Shen Yao Chu.

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
You're so lucky.

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
But

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,440
I still have your mother.

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,720
I think you can't afford to be romantic.

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
Hasn't she woken up?

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
No.

129
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,440
I can only kill her

130
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,280
if I find a doctor.

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Talk to your father.

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Maybe he can hear you.

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
No need.

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,080
Your son is here to see you.

135
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,960
Did you hear him?

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,560
Do you like

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Jing Chuan more

138
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,480
or Jing Xu more?

139
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,760
This is the hairpin you gave me on the wedding night.

140
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,120
I look at it every day.

141
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,840
I always think about the promises you made to me.

142
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
But what about you?

143
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
You lied to me.

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,200
You let that woman marry that woman with a child.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
You let that woman in the brothel

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
ride on my head.

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,680
You made me a joke in Tianjin.

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,880
So I want you to die.

149
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I want you to see

150
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,800
how I destroy that woman.

151
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,680
That woman's child.

152
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Your Ladyship.

153
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
How is it?

154
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,040
Your Ladyship, I found out

155
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,560
that a Lady Shen lives in Guanyin.

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,720
I heard that the general also took care of her.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
The masters took good care of her.

158
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
That's good.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,960
Your Ladyship,

160
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
the day after tomorrow is your return day.

161
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Do you need me to prepare it in advance?

162
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
Return day?

163
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
Where is the general now?

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
He just passed by the study.

165
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,920
The lights are still on.

166
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,600
He hasn't taken a rest yet.

167
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,440
Your Ladyship,

168
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,000
is the general not going to rest here today?

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
He's not coming.

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
Let's go and invite him.

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,320
Your Ladyship, please forgive me.

172
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Greetings, General.

173
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
Who told you to come in?

174
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,680
Although I married into Li's Mansion early,

175
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,480
I never asked for your help.

176
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,880
I only saw you today.

177
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,240
I came to pay my respects.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
I see. You may leave.

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
You're busy with work all day.

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,760
Why don't I give you a massage?

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
My husband.

182
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
Why don't you go back to your room?

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Your Ladyship.

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Shuyu.

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,120
This is...

186
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
Concubine Qin.

187
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,400
Is Concubine Qin here too?

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,880
She didn't disturb you, did she?

189
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,760
I know I'm disturbing you. I won't go out.

190
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,600
What's going on?

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Does she like this kind of style of Concubine Qin?

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,080
Concubine Qin is so pleased with you.

193
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
She can help you solve your problems.

194
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,880
I want to learn it too.

195
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,200
You want to learn it too?

196
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,560
Who brought it here?

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,320
It's mine.

198
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,960
It's the thing I hate the most.

199
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,400
Where's the general?

200
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't worry about me.

201
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
You may continue.

202
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,720
I'll just watch.

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm going to bed.

204
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
It's enough.

205
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
You may go back.

206
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
General.

207
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,600
I said it's enough.

208
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,480
Get out.

209
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
You're not tired, Concubine Qin?

210
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,560
I want to learn it from you.

211
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
Concubine Qin is back.

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
Concubine Qin, you're still not leaving?

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Don't be so rough.

214
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,920
Let me go.

215
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,560
Sometimes, people can understand

216
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,800
when they are jealous.

217
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
General, let's go.

218
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,880
Let's go back to our room and have a rest.

219
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,560
I'll sleep in the study today.

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,280
You think I don't know how to massage.

221
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,840
I'll massage you.

222
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
Stop.

223
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,160
What do you want?

224
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
I wonder if you have time the day after tomorrow.

225
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
The day after tomorrow?

226
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,920
Yes.

227
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
The day after tomorrow is your return.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Do you want me to go back with you?

229
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,320
Yes.

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
But you said

231
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
you didn't need my help in this house.

232
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
You are so narrow-minded.

233
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
You still want me to help you.

234
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm so speechless.

235
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,080
Don't take it to heart.

236
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
The oath you made yesterday

237
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,880
is abandoned today.

238
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
How can I trust you in the future?

239
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm sorry for you.

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
Don't pretend to be pitiful.

241
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,360
I know what you are thinking.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Since you know it,

243
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,440
I won't force you.

244
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Have a good rest.

245
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,520
You can go back if you want.

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Madam, are you sure you don't want to go?

247
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,040
It's okay.

248
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,280
I have my own way.

249
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,580
renovation peque

250
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,600
My mom prepared a present for you.

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Do you like it?

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I miss you, holding you in my arms

253
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Is there a light in front of me?

254
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Time has passed by the years of memories

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Only you are the only one in the long night

256
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,840
The regrets I left behind

257
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,840
are all over you and me

258
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,840
I touch a true heart and cross the mountain of heaven

259
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Just to give you a kiss

260
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,840
I wish I could stay with you forever
