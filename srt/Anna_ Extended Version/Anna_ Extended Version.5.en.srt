1
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,387
Stop, Anna.

2
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:01,122
Why do you keep rushing towards the end?

3
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,677
Because it segues into that part.

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,323
Because it segues?

5
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,319
Your notes are unclear
because you're focused on the speed.

6
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:14,172
Make the beginning simple
to make the ending shine.

7
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,383
Clean and long sounds.

8
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:25,153
It's what we focused on last week.

9
00:01:26,596 --> 00:01:27,559
Yes.

10
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,898
Try again all the way to the end.

11
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:31,305
Pay attention to your breathing too.

12
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:50,754
I wonder why you do this.
Is there a reason?

13
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,081
No, there's no reason.

14
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,356
Why didn't you practice?

15
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,769
- I did.
- How many hours?

16
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,608
Practice more.

17
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:09,946
Also, your attitude today is unacceptable.

18
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:14,249
We're not here for a battle of egos.

19
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,765
I thought
you wanted to continue playing in the UK.

20
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,077
There's a limit to how far you can go
with just talent.

21
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:28,155
Why do I bother...

22
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,694
The name Lee Anna is suspicious.

23
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:12,781
Also, the Alumni Association?

24
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:18,081
That's even more suspicious.

25
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,874
I called the number here
because I was curious about Lee Anna,

26
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,721
and they told me right away.

27
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,579
My goodness.

28
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,468
I had my reasons.

29
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,107
I don't want to know.

30
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:49,902
Am I wrong?

31
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:53,505
There's no reason that can make it okay

32
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,217
for someone like you
to teach at a university.

33
00:03:57,116 --> 00:03:59,888
I mean, do people buy this?

34
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,688
Seriously?

35
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:09,910
I didn't do it intentionally.

36
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,281
Professor Lee.

37
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,670
If doing things unintentionally
makes it okay,

38
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,319
why do you think we have laws?

39
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:34,391
This is fraud.

40
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,839
What should we do?

41
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:42,271
Well?

42
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:46,853
Lee Anna.

43
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:49,935
What should we do now?

44
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,041
I'll stop.

45
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,722
Please give me some time.

46
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,032
How is it so easy for you?

47
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,987
How can it become like it never happened?

48
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,528
You stole someone else's life,

49
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,505
so you must pay for it.

50
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,206
Don't you think so?

51
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,153
Nice.

52
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:50,451
You have overwhelming support
from the young and the established,

53
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,677
while your wife is especially popular

54
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,451
among the marginalized groups.

55
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,794
I'm lucky.

56
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,799
It's true she's playing an important role.

57
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:05,226
So what you do want to do?

58
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,903
What do you think about
having her run a school?

59
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,759
The chairman of Dongsung University
is regretting

60
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,339
after buying the school.

61
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:19,832
The professors don't listen

62
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:25,227
and the students are always complaining
and stirring up noise.

63
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,722
He says it's a headache.

64
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,555
Or perhaps

65
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,175
a scholarship foundation geared towards
public interest might be good.

66
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,482
It doesn't cost much,

67
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,825
and it's quite effective.

68
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,600
A scholarship foundation?

69
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,758
It would be much better than

70
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:47,101
having her stand at a subway station
with your campaign jacket on.

71
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:51,012
- It's different.
- Yes, it's different.

72
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,659
Why not?

73
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,890
Work on it, but keep it low.

74
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:04,914
Okay.

75
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,959
By next month,

76
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:21,305
bring me three billion won.

77
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,040
What is it?

78
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,248
Do you prefer criminal punishment?

79
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:33,108
You didn't think
it would be so expensive, right?

80
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:38,732
That's how it is with degrees.
They're expensive.

81
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,300
You should demand what's possible.

82
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,772
I don't have anything.

83
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,565
That's not my problem.

84
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,786
That's your problem.

85
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:05,366
It's your problem for stealing my life.

86
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,444
What would be the point of accepting
an apology from someone like you?

87
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,626
Forgiveness?

88
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,736
Where would you use that?

89
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:36,159
I don't need that.

90
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,774
This is the wisest
and rational thing to do.

91
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,188
Don't reflect on yourself in front of
a judge who has nothing to do with me.

92
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,841
Pay me back with money instead.

93
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:45,762
Understand?

94
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:58,555
Does your husband know this

95
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,965
about you?

96
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,345
You're really something.

97
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,161
Hey. You should keep on using the stairs.

98
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,264
Last year on New Year's Day,

99
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,541
Choi Ji-hoon

100
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,693
took his executive team hiking
on Bukhan Mountain.

101
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,766
When they were almost at the top,

102
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:42,966
he told his secretary
to go buy some Starbucks.

103
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:46,389
- He's out of his mind.
- He's insane.

104
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:50,118
But secretaries have to do
what they're told.

105
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:54,000
At first, they started to walk down
without any doubt.

106
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,287
Then, they started to have
all kinds of thoughts.

107
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,199
An awakening.

108
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:00,848
Exactly.

109
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:03,590
There's no way of fixing it
when a laborer wakes up.

110
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:07,886
So they just went straight home.

111
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,384
To be honest,

112
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,888
people like Lee Anna
because she's rich and beautiful.

113
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,420
- Am I wrong?
- That's true.

114
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:18,187
Something's unrealistic about her.

115
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,643
I'm sure we'll find some dirt on her
if we dig enough.

116
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,674
Don't bother waking up.

117
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,547
We shouldn't be digging people
on our side.

118
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,143
Just dig into more drinks.

119
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,433
They wouldn't consider us their people.

120
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,643
Only our company is their connection.

121
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:37,430
Right, someone has a connection.

122
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,614
Our Ji-won.

123
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,456
I wouldn't call it a connection.

124
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:51,911
Anna and I
are just ordinary university friends.

125
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,126
Also, I don't know Choi Ji-hoon at all.

126
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,222
What?

127
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,825
- Isn't he backing you?
- No.

128
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:04,759
Not anyone can get into Bokuk.

129
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:08,529
I mean it. Seriously.

130
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:10,085
Hey, newbie.

131
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:16,694
I'll show you
what a real welcome party looks like.

132
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:19,806
Get up.

133
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:25,622
Did you just laugh?

134
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,100
Aren't you going to get up?

135
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,338
That's enough.

136
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:33,700
No, no.

137
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,847
Call me "honey" just once.

138
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,743
Then I'll let things pass.

139
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,739
"Honey".

140
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,561
Honey. Honey.

141
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,704
She got up. She got up.

142
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:52,801
What is this?

143
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:54,798
What's with the face?

144
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,335
Will you look at that?

145
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't reflect on yourself in front of
a judge who has nothing to do with me.

146
00:12:01,123 --> 00:12:02,769
Pay me back with money instead.

147
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:04,884
Understand?

148
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,160
What is it at this hour?

149
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,756
I'm sorry to call you so late.

150
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,835
Yes?

151
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:22,155
I think Mr. Choi
fell asleep in the parking lot.

152
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,896
You should check on him.

153
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,804
This is the police.

154
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,747
Good evening.

155
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,528
I want to report someone
for drinking and driving.

156
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,527
- What?
- My wife's waiting for me at home.

157
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,740
Let me hail a taxi for you. Taxi!

158
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:17,200
Hey, no. No.

159
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,798
I can walk home. I live close.

160
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:22,212
I started to get a belly.

161
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:24,461
Are you going to walk
all the way to Yangjae-dong?

162
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,842
It's faster that way. There's traffic.

163
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:28,976
It's close if I take the highway.

164
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,393
Yes, that's faster.
The city streets are packed.

165
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:35,624
You can just go up that way
to take the highway.

166
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:36,872
Isn't it that way?

167
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,485
Is it that way?

168
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,766
Hey mister, follow me.

169
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:42,035
There.

170
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,205
Follow me. I'll show you.

171
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,792
- What?
- I forgot my bag inside.

172
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,846
- Your bag?
- It's right here.

173
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:52,975
Where did that come from?

174
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:55,305
Hey, wait for me.

175
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:57,814
Let them be.

176
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,594
If you stop them,
you'll have to see them home.

177
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:04,611
Goodnight!

178
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,188
- Bye!
- Goodnight!

179
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:12,061
Once they start walking along the highway,

180
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,174
the police will get them
after seeing them on the security camera.

181
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,030
What a pain.

182
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,092
I'm sure you prepared yourself mentally
before joining the team.

183
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:28,510
You must know already,

184
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,179
but I didn't get hired
through open recruitment either.

185
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,045
I heard rumors
that there's a lot of internal bullying.

186
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:39,859
But don't they feel guilty
while writing such articles?

187
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,730
I'm in no place to promise to help you.

188
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,923
Just hang in there.

189
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:49,378
I'm off.

190
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,622
Okay. Bye.

191
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:00,711
Nag all you want, I won't budge.

192
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,553
Why did the police come
in the middle of the night?

193
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:28,831
It was nothing much.

194
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,226
Why would they come here
if it's nothing much?

195
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,217
I'm going to establish
a scholarship foundation under your name.

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,764
What?

197
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:43,995
You'll be the chairperson.

198
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:50,858
Do I have to do it?

199
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,683
What's with the reaction?

200
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,752
It's uncomfortable to be someone

201
00:16:01,104 --> 00:16:02,355
the media talks about.

202
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:08,027
We wear nice clothes and drive a nice car
for other people to see.

203
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,419
This country is harsh
to those who are weak,

204
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,003
and generous to those who are established.

205
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,986
Just look on the Internet.

206
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:24,688
People are so interested

207
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,304
in the rich and their families.

208
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:31,800
The election isn't something simple.

209
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:37,502
Even the way we breathe has meaning
and we can get evaluated on it.

210
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:38,998
Okay?

211
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,921
Do you want me to hire a driver for you?

212
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:50,495
I prefer going around alone.

213
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,095
Why don't you get more helpers?
Everyone has 3 or 4 at home.

214
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,061
Didn't I tell you?

215
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,916
My assistant will join me
to and from work starting today.

216
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,843
- Mr. Jung?
- No, my secretary.

217
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:12,988
You're here.

218
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,783
Wait a minute.

219
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,336
Hello, Professor Lee.

220
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,422
My name is Cho Yu-mi.

221
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,971
I look forward to working for you.

222
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:35,435
Hello.

223
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,791
Ms. Cho...

224
00:17:40,148 --> 00:17:41,431
Yu-mi...

225
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,511
Please sit down.

226
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:46,441
That's okay.

227
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,766
I can wait here until Mr. Choi is ready.

228
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,990
Please speak comfortably to me.

229
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:02,590
Get up.

230
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,406
Get up.

231
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:17,255
Hey. What are you going to do?

232
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:20,677
What is this?

233
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,470
Explain it to me.

234
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:25,093
Who told you to use this building
as collateral?

235
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:28,552
What is it? It's too early for this.

236
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:31,907
Hyun-joo, get up. Get up.

237
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,412
Hyun-joo,

238
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:36,793
what did you do?

239
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,766
Did you buy more stocks?

240
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:42,730
Wake up and talk to me.

241
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:43,869
Yes.

242
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,088
"Yes"?

243
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:51,873
Gosh.

244
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:59,065
I'll die before my time because of you.

245
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:01,721
How could you...

246
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:04,915
You...

247
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:08,064
You're out of your mind!

248
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,274
How could you blow off this building?

249
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,953
What's wrong with you?

250
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:19,713
Just go kill yourself.

251
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:22,355
Hyun-joo, we should die together.

252
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,411
Why would we die because of this?

253
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:27,980
I'll take care of it.

254
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,853
Take care of what?

255
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,226
I'll just pay back the three billion won.

256
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,913
It's nothing.

257
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:38,976
What?

258
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:44,399
I said I'll take care of it.

259
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:47,018
Please stop it!

260
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,337
You only know how to spend money.
You've never earned a cent in your life.

261
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:58,060
How can you take care of anything?

262
00:20:02,564 --> 00:20:04,051
- Yu-mi.
- Yes?

263
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,683
- Let's go.
- Okay.

264
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:08,937
I'll take that for you.

265
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:24,859
I'm sorry,
it's because it's my first time.

266
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:27,712
Yes, it's your first time.
Just press this.

267
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:31,232
Okay?

268
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:35,775
I'm leaving.
Don't forget the gathering this evening.

269
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,982
From now on, Yu-mi will remind you.

270
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:49,705
Hello, Professor Lee.

271
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:51,300
My name is Cho Yu-mi.

272
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:57,542
Even the way we breathe has meaning
and we can get evaluated on it.

273
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,765
You didn't think
it would be so expensive, right?

274
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:05,260
That's how it is with degrees.
They're expensive.

275
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:08,437
Three billion won.

276
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,318
Hey.

277
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:25,941
What brought you here?

278
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:31,271
Our company is planning a small exhibition
and the person who was on the project

279
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:34,280
ended up giving birth
earlier than she thought.

280
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,824
We need some help.

281
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,766
I see.

282
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:39,878
LITERATI PAINTINGS

283
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:42,472
Joseon literati paintings.
It's your specialty.

284
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:43,783
Do you want to take over?

285
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,912
Why don't you do it yourself?

286
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,460
It's too small for me to do.

287
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,639
The people who own these works
want to sell the paintings,

288
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:56,926
but you know these kinds of works
don't increase in prices.

289
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,459
The exhibition will be held
so we can promote the pieces.

290
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:02,521
I don't know.

291
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:11,512
There's no pressure
since it's not about making money.

292
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:17,346
There's enough time to prepare it too.

293
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:23,273
What is it? Is it too lame?

294
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,367
I used to take jobs like this
at first too.

295
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:33,665
No, it's not that...

296
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:37,254
Can't you help me out this once?

297
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,472
How much

298
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:44,929
will they pay me?

299
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:49,547
Come on, you know this won't pay much.

300
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,129
It's not like you're looking for money.

301
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,137
Please do it for me.

302
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:59,345
You'll do it, right?

303
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:02,995
Democratic Republican Party's Choi Ji-hoon

304
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:05,091
is making prominent progress,

305
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,835
but as factions
of the 51 newly-elected members

306
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:11,333
out of the 117
in the National Assembly are unclear,

307
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:14,155
it's hard to predict the result.

308
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:16,066
Currently,
the Democratic Republican Party...

309
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:17,264
Mr. Jung.

310
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,029
What should we do with Min Jun-won?

311
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:25,546
Don't mind him.

312
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,607
It's good to have a pace maker.

313
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:33,789
Doesn't he have a son?

314
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,655
Yes, he does.

315
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:50,292
Should I dig about his son?

316
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,804
Is that necessary?

317
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:03,021
We need something on him
since he's bothering us.

318
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:07,087
Okay.

319
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:17,130
You're right. It's his one and only son.

320
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,520
There must be something about him.

321
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:29,112
Professor Lee.

322
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,344
Professor Lee.

323
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,503
I have something to ask you.

324
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,906
My kid is getting a surgery tomorrow.

325
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:52,646
I wonder if I could have tomorrow
and the day after off.

326
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:55,818
It's nothing serious,

327
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:58,767
but my kid is still in middle school,
so...

328
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,584
Why is...

329
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,840
everyone doing this to me?

330
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:20,895
You can't do this all of a sudden.

331
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:27,751
Don't you know that the campaign team
is having a meal here tomorrow?

332
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:34,327
Why are you so selfish?

333
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,290
Please don't worry about that.

334
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:39,347
I already prepared everything,

335
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,322
and someone else will come instead.

336
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,018
Someone I don't know is coming?

337
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:48,529
No, no. It's not a stranger.

338
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:50,937
It's Yang Soo-jin.

339
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,112
She came several times before
whenever we had big events.

340
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:59,400
You know, the tall girl with short hair.

341
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:02,526
You'll recognize her when you see her.

342
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,868
I see.

343
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:18,912
Now that I think about it,
it might inconvenience you.

344
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,192
I'm sorry,

345
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:25,871
please don't mind me. It's okay.

346
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,541
How can I act like nothing happened?

347
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:34,608
Why are you making me
look like a bad person?

348
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,198
Are you going to cancel the surgery?

349
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:41,651
No, it's not like that...

350
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,010
Why do I have to

351
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,778
humor you too?

352
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:49,140
Why do I have to pay attention
to such things?

353
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,336
It's fine.

354
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,195
Just take two days off.

355
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:22,976
I'm sorry, Professor Lee.

356
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:25,920
I asked you too last minute.

357
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,528
It can't be helped

358
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,521
in your situation.

359
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:37,179
Sorry I'm a little sensitive today.

360
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:40,742
We'll eat out tomorrow.

361
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:46,946
What is it?

362
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,899
I came to get you for the dinner.

363
00:27:56,271 --> 00:28:00,530
From now on, call me from downstairs.

364
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:02,654
Yes, Ma'am.

365
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:09,664
She usually never yells.

366
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:13,803
It's because I made a mistake today.

367
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:20,955
IT Solid's stock price from four years ago
looks strange?

368
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:23,779
So what?

369
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:29,653
The election is around the corner.
Why are you snooping around?

370
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:33,074
We need to verify since it's a company
related to a strong candidate.

371
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:37,107
Do you have time on your hands?

372
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:43,881
Are you acting like you don't know,
or do you really not know?

373
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,843
You'd be writing multiple apologies
if it wasn't for the HR team.

374
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,980
You know that?

375
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,320
I find you

376
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:53,737
extremely difficult.

377
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:55,878
Pardon?

378
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,447
You're so dense!

379
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:13,834
Ms. Cho,
how long have you worked in this field?

380
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:16,661
This is my third year.

381
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:20,401
It's been a year
since I worked for Mr. Choi.

382
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:23,802
How did you get involved?

383
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:28,897
I was studying to take
the civil service exam for five years,

384
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,246
but it didn't work out.

385
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,346
I felt so guilty towards my parents

386
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:37,056
since I spent a long time studying.

387
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,184
I was getting depressed too.

388
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:46,422
You might not be able to understand
my situation.

389
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:52,157
Are your parents happy now?

390
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:57,422
I guess they're disappointed.

391
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:04,334
They tell other people
that I'm a civil servant now.

392
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:06,978
Everyone lies a little

393
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:13,381
to save face.

394
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:18,178
I feel uncomfortable

395
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,727
since it's a lie.

396
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:34,305
Ms. Cho. You must be someone honest.

397
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:38,077
No, I'm just someone ordinary.

398
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,236
Isn't it hard working for Ji-hoon?

399
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,130
Not at all.

400
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:49,808
I know this job
doesn't allow any time off.

401
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,963
But it's a precious opportunity for me,

402
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:56,538
so I want to do my best
and get recognized.

403
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:04,600
Also, he's very nice to me.

404
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,608
See?

405
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,008
Everyone lies.

406
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:15,872
No, I'm telling you the truth.

407
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,177
Ma'am, he's asking you to wait 20 minutes.

408
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,338
Why?

409
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:35,004
He says you should come in
after everyone arrives.

410
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:37,823
I'll go in and check first.

411
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:04,829
- I don't think he's here yet.
- What?

412
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:08,068
I checked
with the restaurant manager twice.

413
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:10,275
What a joke.

414
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,435
It'd be ridiculous to wait here.

415
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:15,816
Let's circle around.

416
00:32:16,506 --> 00:32:17,396
Yes, Ma'am.

417
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:26,183
Hey, Mom.

418
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:28,568
Can I skip this meeting?

419
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:34,501
I think he's crazy.
That stupid doctor isn't here yet.

420
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,410
Let's go in. Everyone's here.

421
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:08,411
LEE ANNA

422
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,399
YALE UNIVERSITY,
MASTER OF ARTS IN EAST ASIAN STUDIES

423
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:24,015
I'm afraid it won't be possible
to speak to him directly at the moment.

424
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,773
Yes, Mr. Choi is in a meeting.

425
00:34:29,856 --> 00:34:32,899
It's not like everything always goes
the way you want.

426
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:34,375
No, of course not.

427
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,792
It's the will of the people
and the will of the party.

428
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,789
But if the will

429
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,603
keeps on changing,

430
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:48,943
the people will get confused.

431
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,379
Things change by the day.

432
00:34:53,462 --> 00:34:55,448
I don't know what to tell you.

433
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:59,117
It's okay.

434
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,372
You were elected four times
and you'll act as my pace maker,

435
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:03,825
so I'm happy.

436
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,828
You say it's urgent,
so could you tell me what it's about?

437
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,588
Here.

438
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,718
- Please have a drink.
- Okay.

439
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:17,855
Sir.

440
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:20,743
Thank you.

441
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,413
It's been so long since we drank.

442
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,326
What is it? Can't do it?

443
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:29,705
To be honest, if he becomes the mayor,

444
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,764
he'll lift the constraints
on green belts first, right?

445
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:36,288
That shouldn't happen.

446
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:37,905
Pardon?

447
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:42,690
Nothing.

448
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:48,116
It shouldn't be the green belts
he works on first.

449
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:50,618
We need to keep
the public opinion in mind.

450
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:54,386
Of course. Things must be done in order.

451
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,259
But we believe in him.

452
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,517
We got that land as inheritance,
and it's been such a nuisance.

453
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:05,823
You know, inheritance tax.

454
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:10,870
You never know what will happen, right?

455
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:16,076
If you had to pay inheritance tax,
the land must be over 700 million won.

456
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,469
You shouldn't put it like that.

457
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:25,798
Those who work at a convenience store
on an hourly wage still pay their taxes.

458
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:31,397
Come on. I'm just saying.

459
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,116
He needs to get elected first.

460
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:37,788
Just as you said,

461
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,324
you never know what will happen.

462
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,874
By the way,

463
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:49,152
I sent my kid to the UK to study.

464
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:53,425
I thought of you
when we went there last week

465
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,761
to drop him off at the dormitory.

466
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,854
What is it?

467
00:38:01,937 --> 00:38:04,681
It's nothing much.
I don't mean anything by it.

468
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,453
I'm sure you have more beautiful
and precious stuff,

469
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,578
but this is a gift from my heart,
so please accept it.

470
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,785
I'll pick up the bill.

471
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,739
Take your time.

472
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,615
Yes.

473
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,598
She's young, but very stubborn.

474
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,707
Not once
did she look at me with warm eyes.

475
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,096
She's super rude.

476
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:51,239
Do you think so?
Is it because she lived abroad?

477
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:54,456
Maybe she doesn't know much about Korea.

478
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:04,601
Jae-ho.

479
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:08,492
Why didn't you call me in advance?
Do you want some coffee?

480
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,989
No, it's okay.
I stopped by on my way to the airport.

481
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,718
- Are you going to the US?
- Yes.

482
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:18,330
By the way, you changed companies.

483
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:19,414
Right.

484
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:27,901
"Bokuk"?

485
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:30,342
Isn't it the biggest one in Korea?

486
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:31,635
Yes.

487
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:35,605
I didn't make the cut
when I took the entrance exam before,

488
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:37,284
but I'll work hard from now.

489
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:40,100
The elections are soon, so it's hectic.

490
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:43,457
Good for you. I think you'll do well.

491
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,632
Thank you.

492
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:47,809
By the way,

493
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:51,560
I doubt you came here just to see me.

494
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:00,082
Is this

495
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,439
Lee Yu-mi?

496
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:06,351
Yes.

497
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,918
I didn't want things to be awkward,
so I never brought her up.

498
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:16,096
I'm not going to live in Korea anyway,

499
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:17,966
so it doesn't matter what she does.

500
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:23,437
But I thought I should tell you
why I broke up with her.

501
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,388
Jae-ho, let bygones be bygones.

502
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,852
It's not that, Ji-won.

503
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:33,126
Lee Yu-mi

504
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:36,890
didn't go to your school.

505
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,451
What?

506
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:44,406
I have no idea how she graduated
from NYU and Yale

507
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:46,588
to become a professor,

508
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:50,819
but she was a fake university student
when we were dating.

509
00:40:50,902 --> 00:40:52,251
She was preparing for her SATs
a third time.

510
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:54,809
Lee Anna?

511
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:58,970
I don't trust that name either.

512
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:05,778
What are you talking about?

513
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:39,778
Hey.

514
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,762
It's about 100 million won.

515
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,705
It's the best I can do.

516
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:04,441
Yu-mi.

517
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:09,344
Everything in this world
is possible with money.

518
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,939
But if something's not possible,

519
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:16,430
you should ask yourself
if it was because there wasn't enough.

520
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:20,862
Hey. Don't be so disappointed.

521
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,893
You still have time.

522
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:27,631
I know you're smart.

523
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:32,006
Or you should just confess to your husband
and ask for some money.

524
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:34,261
Should I call him for you?

525
00:42:40,914 --> 00:42:42,855
You know I'm impatient, right?

526
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:47,111
Make sure you meet the deadline.

527
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:57,599
Right, Yu-mi!

528
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:02,097
Stay out of my sight

529
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,488
and use the stairs, will you?

530
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,247
LEE ANNA, DONGJIN UNIVERSITY

531
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:24,024
SEOUL MAYOR CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE
PROFESSOR LEE ANNA

532
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:27,133
PROFESSOR LEE ANNA UNEXPECTEDLY INTERPRETS
SIGN LANGUAGE AT THE SCHOLARSHIP CEREMONY

533
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,343
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

534
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:40,635
You lived in America, so why are you
going back to study English?

535
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,722
My question exactly.

536
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:43,609
No, I still have a long way to go.

537
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,972
I'm so jealous.

538
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,445
I'm the most jealous about her parents

539
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,308
letting her go with her boyfriend.

540
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:50,327
Same.

541
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,670
They tend to be open-minded

542
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:54,766
since they live abroad.

543
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,045
You're so lucky.

544
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:59,332
Will you get married after graduating?

545
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:00,467
Really?

546
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:02,946
No way.

547
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:04,906
Yes.

548
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:06,059
Really?

549
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:08,660
- I'll sing at your wedding.
- I'm so jealous.

550
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:10,588
Okay. I'll be the MC.

551
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,567
Did you hand in your leave of absence?
When are you leaving?

552
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:14,522
In one week.

553
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:16,717
Which school will you go to?

554
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:20,024
I'll probably attend
the same one as Jae-ho.

555
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,977
- Columbia?
- Columbia?

556
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,576
The tuition must be crazy expensive.

557
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:25,760
- Really?
- Yes, it's in New York.

558
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:27,142
Wait, guys.

559
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:32,770
We all pitched in to get this.

560
00:44:33,262 --> 00:44:34,781
What is it?

561
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:36,566
- Open it.
- It's nothing much.

562
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:40,575
I'm already so thankful
that you prepared a goodbye party.

563
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:42,110
Isn't it pretty? Aren't we thoughtful?

564
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,860
- It's the scent that's important.
- Take a sniff.

565
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:44,922
Isn't it pretty?

566
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:46,874
- Put it on.
- Hurry, hurry.

567
00:44:57,774 --> 00:45:01,384
Hello. I'm Reporter Han Ji-won
from Bokuk Daily,

568
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:03,062
and I'm an alumna.

569
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:06,807
Yes. I called because

570
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,253
I want to know how I can look up
previously admitted students.

571
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:14,262
No. Not a graduate,
but someone who was admitted.

572
00:45:15,436 --> 00:45:17,432
There were seven people

573
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,360
in the 10 years between 1995 and 2005

574
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:22,894
with the name Lee Yu-mi.

575
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:25,198
But no one was in Aesthetics.

576
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,688
Could I ask you to check one more person?

577
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,653
- Sure.
- Lee Anna.

578
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,416
Can I also check
if she ever took a year off?

579
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:04,919
Ma'am.

580
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:09,231
Look who it is.

581
00:46:09,314 --> 00:46:10,562
Do you remember me?

582
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:13,242
Of course I recognize you, Ji-won.

583
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:15,058
We lived together for four years.

584
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,354
Are you done with the boarding house?

585
00:46:17,437 --> 00:46:20,602
Yes. The world changed.
I manage studio apartments now.

586
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:21,670
Studio apartments.

587
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,830
We built it three years ago.

588
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:27,325
Wow, you're a landlord. I envy you.

589
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:31,116
Lee Yu-mi? Of course I know her.

590
00:46:32,394 --> 00:46:34,556
I'd never be able to forget her.

591
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:36,482
Why not?

592
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:38,590
When she moved out,

593
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:42,249
she ran away without paying me
the last two months' rent.

594
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,355
She ran away?

595
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:49,097
She is really good-looking and pretty.

596
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,256
I ran my boarding house for 20 years,

597
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:53,341
yet I fell for it because of that face.

598
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:56,924
She did that?

599
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:59,819
She was behind by two months,

600
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:02,073
but she didn't come home for days.

601
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:03,778
She wouldn't pick up her phone either.

602
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:07,219
I called her parents back home

603
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:10,410
and learned that she had left for the US
without telling me.

604
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,597
She left all her belongings behind too.

605
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,115
When I cleaned out her room,
I found so many clothes.

606
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:23,733
I went all the way
to Gangwon Province then

607
00:47:23,816 --> 00:47:27,517
to get the two months of rent

608
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,625
and my transportation fare
from her father.

609
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,607
Where in Gangwon-do? Do you remember it?

610
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,668
Hongcheon.

611
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:35,471
Hongcheon...

612
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:37,849
I remember because it was where my son
went for his army service.

613
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,614
They ran a tailor's shop
at the entrance of the market.

614
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,375
The market?

615
00:47:43,116 --> 00:47:45,967
When I visited them,
things didn't look so good.

616
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:49,987
They were really devoted
to supporting their daughter.

617
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,960
They always sent me a melon
every Thanksgiving.

618
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,758
It was very expensive back then.

619
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:01,334
Right. Melon...

620
00:48:03,996 --> 00:48:06,083
Wow, Choi Ji-hoon.

621
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:09,273
Isn't it considered cheating to found
a scholarship foundation at this time?

622
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:11,999
- What is it?
- Take a look.

623
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,765
LEE ESTABLISHES SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF PREPARATION

624
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,010
It's nothing much.
I don't mean anything by it.

625
00:48:43,894 --> 00:48:47,378
This is a gift from my heart,
so please accept it.
