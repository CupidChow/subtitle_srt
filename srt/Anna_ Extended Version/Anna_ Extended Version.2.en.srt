This number is turned off.
You'll be connected to voicemail after...

3
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,855
- Hello--
- How dare you lie so shamelessly?

4
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,887
If you call Jae-ho one more time,

5
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,096
I'll hunt you down and teach you a lesson!

6
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,319
Where are you right--

7
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,765
Hey, Mom.

8
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,560
Sorry I called you so late.

9
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,780
I've been so busy
I didn't realize a week passed already.

10
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,884
Mom, what's wrong?

11
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,923
- Yu-mi.
- Mom, let me talk to Dad.

12
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,860
Yu-mi, it's your neighbor.

13
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:20,050
Hello. Can you--

14
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,741
Don't be startled.

15
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,364
Your father passed away.

16
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,693
He lost consciousness two days ago,

17
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,730
and he passed away this morning.

18
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:33,245
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:35,898
Can you come?

20
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,791
Yu-mi.

21
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,023
He had cancer.

22
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,685
They were going to tell you
before you left,

23
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,053
but your father wouldn't allow it.

24
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,678
He didn't want to get in your way.

25
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,015
Yu-mi...

26
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:40,039
LATE LEE SANG-HO

27
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,369
I'll

28
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:58,718
just try my hardest now.

29
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:05,071
I'm sorry for everything.

30
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:13,663
Hey, Yu-mi.

31
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,953
Hi, Jae-ho.

32
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,230
Why do you live your life like that?

33
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,008
Shouldn't you at least make an excuse?

34
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:30,391
I was

35
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,553
planning to tell you first,

36
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,597
but it was too hard.

37
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,510
You're crazy.

38
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:09,615
Hello, Sir. This is Yu-mi.

39
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,966
Yes, Yu-mi from Baekma.

40
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,751
Is it possible to sell our shop?

41
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:22,863
Even if it's for cheap?

42
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,247
Okay, I understand.

43
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,838
YU-MI, 300,000 WON

YU-MI, 7.3 MILLION WON

47
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:58,779
Who are you?

48
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,370
I heard the owner here passed away.

49
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,699
Yes. Why do you ask?

50
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,868
He borrowed money from me last month.

51
00:07:11,384 --> 00:07:14,747
Now, who do I get that money back from?

52
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:26,741
Please call me if anyone
shows interest in buying the shop.

53
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:28,981
I'll send mom's living expenses monthly.

54
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,502
Don't worry about her.

55
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:32,428
It's better she stays with me.

56
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,410
Focus on your job.

57
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:40,335
Don't worry.
Call me and visit me often.

58
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:43,938
I'll get going.

59
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,197
Bye, Mom.

60
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,044
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,719
Take care.

62
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,541
If you want to become
a ninth-grade civil servant in Seoul,

63
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:30,173
it's mandatory to take Korean,
English, and Korean history.

64
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,384
You have to take two electives too.

65
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,005
The comprehensive course
is 450,000 won per month.

66
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:37,666
BALANCE: 1,510,400 WON

67
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,911
Okay, I'll call back later.

68
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,118

00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,166
Which one?

84
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,165
Dunhill.

85
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,076
Which Dunhill?

86
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:10,147
1mg.

87
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,144
It's 2,500 won.

88
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,786
No, not that one.

89
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,878
This is 1mg.

90
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:25,386
You know, the other one. The thin one.

91
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,768
Do you mean Fine Cut 1mg?

92
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,107
No, not that one.

93
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,692
Then what? What do you want?

94
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:36,629
The one that costs 2,000 won.

95
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,002
- Pocket 1mg?
- Yes, that one.

96
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,314
Give me one of those.

97
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,625
It's 2,000 won.

98
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:02,788
Geez. Does it have to be this hard...

99
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,170
to buy cigarettes?

100
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:10,547
Is it that hard?

101
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,993
Goodbye.

102

Hey.

107
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:52,592
Are you still waiting?

108
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,048
Right!

109
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:15,177
You're waiting for me, right?

110
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:17,089
I'm sorry.

111

Dad!

112
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,564
Just tell my dad you'll work hard,

113
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,960
and he'll hire you.

114
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,334
Hey. Where's Dad?

115
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,432
He went to a church event
with Big Director.

116
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,488
I see.

117
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:35,705
They said they'll be home late.

118
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:37,720
You can do the interview
and make the decision.

119
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,313
- I'm going out.
- Me?

120
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,784
Why not? I'll give Dad a heads-up.

121
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:46,107
Yes? Hello?

122
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,216
Yes.

123
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:51,393
I thought she was taking her time
with the interview.

124
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:52,626
It's all right.

125
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,529
It's family-run here,
so it's a bit different.

126
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:00,326
Tell me right away
if it's not for you.

127
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,308
Some people don't show up
after just a day or two.

128
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:05,026
That can take a toll on us too.

129
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,912
Okay.

130
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,852
The owner was born and raised here.

131
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:17,160
I heard he majored in the arts,

132
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,616
but none of us know exactly what.

133
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,335
They all call him Designer Lee.

134
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:27,911
RESUME

135
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:29,865
You only graduated high school.

136
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,701
Yes.

137
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,896
I'm only allowing it
because my daughter wants to hire you.

138
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:40,975
Ms. Kim must have told you already,

139
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:45,688
but tardiness and no shows
aren't tolerated.

140
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:47,958
I understand.

141
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,736
Make sure nothing makes
Hyun-joo uncomfortable.

142
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,156
Stick by her side and focus on that.

143
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:55,864
The most important thing to me
is keeping promises.

144
00:16:58,453 --> 00:16:59,592
Can you do it?

145
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,775
All the furniture here

146
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,125
are by famous designers
and were imported from abroad.

147
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,005
They're expensive.

148
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:12,855
That little chair costs 15 million won.

149
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,993
Patoulji Melissa Manu.

150
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,217
I got it right.

151
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:20,737
I memorized them all.

152
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:34,029
Herman Miller.
Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman in white.

153
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:39,058
The Olive Garden is managed
by Mr. Lee's wife.

154
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,690
We call her Big Director.

155
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,668
She often holds church gatherings here.

156
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,932
In addition to nurturing our bodies,

157
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:52,077
please allow our spirits to be nurtured

158
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,259
as well.

159
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,681
Thank you, Father.

160
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:00,215
We'll enjoy the food.

161
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,454
- Amen.
- Amen.

162
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,407
What is this?

163
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,407
Gosh, what is this?

164
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:17,762
What is this, Deaconess?

165
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,352
It's thanks to you
that my daughter's marriage is in talks.

166
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:23,649
This is the least I can do.

167
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,928
Your daughter is already perfect
in every way.

168
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:27,960
She doesn't need us to get married.

169
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:33,443
It was my wish to get a doctor son-in-law.

170
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:35,212
My wish is going to come true.

171
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,579
I'm thankful for all the support from you.

172
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:41,106
If you wanted a doctor in the family,

173
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,472
why didn't you raise her to be a doctor?

174
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,481
Gosh, how could I make my child
have such an exhausting job?

175
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,343
Yes. They say you should never
raise your child as a doctor or a lawyer.

176
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:51,463
You can just hire them.

177
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,207
You're right.

178
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,941
That's true.

179
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,748
- We'll enjoy this.
- Thank you.

180
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:02,055
You met Little Director earlier.
She's Mr. Lee's daughter.

181
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,421
I bought this.

182
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,084
Welcome back.

183
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,035
She's the only child, so she's fussy.

184
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:11,501
She moved back from the US last year,

185
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,394
and runs a prop shop.

186
00:19:15,264 --> 00:19:16,290
Isn't it pretty?

187
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:21,433
I went to the store,
and this was the last one left.

188
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,970
I wanted the orange one too.

189
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,395
You can have this.

190
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,303
I'm okay.

191
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,879
What's the matter?
Is it because it's used?

192
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:48,049
You should dress up a little.

193
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,470
This is expensive stuff.

194
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,397
Thank you.

195
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:07,554
I went to the car wash
to wash my car this morning,

196
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:10,576
but I walked there since it was close.

197
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:16,460
Little Director is often away,

198
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:20,703
so the person in charge of this place
will only get a day off in a month.

199
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:26,616
Some of the items
are imported from abroad,

200
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:29,534
but most of them are from the market.

201
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,271
Is this from Namdaemun Market too?

202
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:34,358
Yes.

203
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,959
How much is that one you're holding?

204
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,127
This is 66,000 won.

205
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:45,812
That?

206
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,503
The finish is lousy.

207
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:55,149
Place it beside the ivory mirror.

208
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,853
Mark it as 260,000 won.

209
00:20:57,936 --> 00:20:58,907
Okay.

210
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:04,105
To be honest,
it's more of an administrative position

211
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:05,736
than an office job.

212
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,379
You'll be paid 1 million won for 3 months.

213
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:13,662
After that,
it'll be 1.3 million won a month.

214
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:16,490
Hello?

215
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:27,349
You only worked part-time for five years.

216
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,612
This will still be better
than a part-time job.

217
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:34,581
At least you get an insurance.

218
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:49,156
Mom.

219
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,979
We have health insurance now,

220
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,247
so make sure
to go to the doctor regularly. Okay?

221
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:58,330
Tap twice if you understood.

222
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:15,302
What? Is that a fire?

223
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,153
Where?

224
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:18,951
There.

225
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,846
Gosh, how did that happen?

226
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,612
There's a fire.

227
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,662
My goodness.

228
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,616
We just received breaking news

229
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,025
that Korea's number one national treasure,
Namdaemun, is on fire.

230
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,940
Reporter Kim Jung-hoon,
please share the story.

231
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,159
For the first 30 minutes
after the fire was spotted,

232
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:39,142
smoke rose above the rooftop.

233
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:42,856
The fire remained out of control
even after an hour.

234
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,230
At 9:59 p.m., the fire authorities

235
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,527
declared level two in fire emergency,

236
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,012
but the conditions continue to worsen.

237
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,326
I don't like doctors.

238
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:57,085
Hyun-joo, he's not an ordinary doctor.

239
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,862
He'll inherit his father's hospital
and his mother's gallery.

240
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,149
He looks like a dork when he smiles.

241
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,717
He's not attractive.

242
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,852
His background is attractive.

243
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:14,333
None of your friends
who married after dating are doing well.

244
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:18,123
Ji-soo. Ji-soo's doing well.

245
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,642
Geez.

246
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,581
Enough.
When the gallery director comes later,

247
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,793
I'll make a natural introduction.
You need to come and say hello.

248
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:35,836
Sit up, this is too revealing.

249
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,109
That shirt is too low too.

250
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:44,381
Gosh. Your bra strap is showing. Please!

251
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,077
I'm glad you can see it.

252
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,966
These were expensive.

253
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,715
Yu-mi?

254
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:00,678
Yes?

255
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:03,623
Go to Hyun-joo's house
to bring her some clothes.

256
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,936
Something that covers up all her skin.

257
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,636
Bring several outfits.

258
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:11,397
Gosh. Gosh!

259
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:06,073
Wow...

260
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:41,779
She studied Fine Arts at NYU,

261
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:44,755
then she studied Asian Art Studies at Yale

262
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:46,937
before returning to Korea last year.

263
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,669
Gosh, you're so beautiful.

264
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:52,651
I only have three sons,
so I envy people with daughters.

265
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:58,054
But people tend to stereotype

266
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:01,821
when we tell them she studied art.

267
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,557
That's why she got her master's in theory.

268
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,213
No wonder everyone at church
complimented her.

269
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:09,649
Gosh, really?

270
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:13,357
It's the first I've heard of it.

271
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,837
Who could've complimented her?

272
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,156
They were just kind to say nice things.

273
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,106
You raised your daughter well.

274
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:27,878
Until middle school,
she played the violin in the UK,

275
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,183
and people called her gifted.

276
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:36,045
But playing an instrument
is physically so hard.

277
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:39,070
I couldn't get myself to force my child

278
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:41,550
to continue something so strenuous.

279
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:45,662
But people called her gifted
when she started drawing too...

280
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,840
SEOUL CYBER UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT CENTER

281
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,746
REGISTRATION FEE: 748,800 WON

282
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:33,018
One hundred
and twenty thousand won, please.

283
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,367
Yu-mi.

284
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:06,648
Yes?

285
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:09,103
Lee Yu-mi.

286
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:11,657
I'm coming, darn it.

287
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,918
Coming!

288
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,020
Ms. Lee.

289
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:48,226
Hey.

290
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:53,328
Today's the day we promised
to give the director the documents.

291
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:58,536
In the drawer over there.

292
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:09,592
Do you only need my school papers?

293
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,065
Yes, I have everything else.

294
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:16,938
You could even get a loan under my name
if you wanted.

295
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:22,046
You know my credit card password
and have my bank certificate too.

296
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:24,501
There are several copies.
Which one should I take?

297
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:27,303
I don't care. Just take them all.

298
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,191
I got several copies when I graduated,

299
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,682
and now they're finally being put to use.

300
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:38,700
Whatever.

301
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,062
Is it Tuesday today?

302
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:55,085
Can you go to the department store
and pick up my coat?

303
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:56,757
I exchanged sizes.

304
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,621
Yu-mi.

305
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:02,567
Here's a watch.

306
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,757
It's a brand from Switzerland.
I only wore it once.

307
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,531
Don't tell the other employees.

308
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:34,999
I'm here to see Director Song
for a meeting at 2:00 p.m.

309
00:31:35,082 --> 00:31:36,319
Are you Lee Yu-mi?

310
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:37,445
Yes.

311
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:41,013
I'll show you in.

312
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:49,454
Lee Yu-mi from Marais is here.

313
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,424
Hello, Director Song.

314
00:32:12,507 --> 00:32:14,775
I'm here to deliver
Ms. Lee Hyun-joo's documents.

315
00:32:14,858 --> 00:32:15,918
I see.

316
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:27,239
They are her family relation certificate,
health exam result,

317
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,109
and her diploma.

318
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,804
How long did you work for her?

319
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,517
This is my third year.

320
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,644
What is Director Lee Hyun-joo like?

321
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:47,230
She's responsible, considerate,

322
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,149
and nice to me.

323
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,936
I think I asked the obvious.

324
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,009
Please wait while I review them.

325
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,053
Okay.

326
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,337
Try it on.

327
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,359
Pardon?

328
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:37,325
It's made of organic cashmere.
It's super light.

329
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:40,306
It comes in these three colors.

330
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:42,328
I see.

331
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:45,840
Try it on.

332
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:49,691
It's a muted tone,
so it's easy to wear daily.

333
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:51,743
It goes well with the coat you bought too.

334
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,546
Nice, isn't it?

335
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,207
It's on sale as of yesterday.

336
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:11,380
I see.

337
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:21,772
I'll take it.

338
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:24,456
Sure. I'll pack a new one.

339
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,443
It's 621,000 won.

340
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:48,748
Pardon?

341
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,479
It's 621,000 won
with the 10 percent discount.

342
00:34:54,478 --> 00:34:55,389
I see.

343
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,371
Do you want to pay in installments?

344
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:02,674
No, I'll pay at once.

345
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,149
Come in.

346
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:17,963
Is it your day off?

347
00:36:18,498 --> 00:36:20,336
- Yes, Manager.
- Good.

348
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:22,133
If you didn't have dinner,
let's eat together.

349
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,764
It's okay. I'm not hungry yet.

350
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,732
Come on. I don't want to eat alone.

351
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:35,719
Okay? Let's go.

352
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:38,456
FATHER'S LOVE BUFFET

353
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:39,621
It's over here.

354
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:42,766
Hurry up.

355
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,967
I was going to treat you,
but you paid already.

356
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,088
I think this place

357
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:12,351
is the best value for money in the area.

358
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,447
Enjoy.

359
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:26,588
What's the matter?

360
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:31,363
I have to go to the dentist,
but I didn't get to yet.

361
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:32,531
It's okay now.

362
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:35,067
The dentist?

363
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,232
It can be scary.

364
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,087
Did you know
I'm studying for the bar exam?

365
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:45,747
Really?

366
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,150
I've been warming up last year,

367
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:52,819
and I think I'll make it this year.

368
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,674
I have a feeling.

369
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:57,719
It must be hard to study.

370
00:37:57,802 --> 00:37:59,803
I'll get married right away
if I pass the bar.

371
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:08,518
You've known me for a while.

372
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:10,668
What do you think

373
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,807
about dating me?

374
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:19,965
Pardon?

375
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,947
You can support me while I study.

376
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:26,596
When it comes to studying,

377
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,965
one definitely needs someone
to support them.

378
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:42,084
You jerk.

379
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,365
Do I look easy to you?

380
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:02,881
I think you misunderstood.

381
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,129
What did I misunderstand?

382
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,098
Well...

383
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,200
A punk like you
is going to become a lawyer?

384
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,979
Do you know why a woman pays first?

385
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,808
So that a loser like you
won't get the wrong message.

386
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:19,568
We do it to avoid getting into
this kind of disgusting situation.

387
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,145
Understand?

388
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:24,370
Yes.

389
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:42,564
MARAIS LITTLE DIRECTOR

390
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,756
Yes, Ms. Lee.

391
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:48,594
Yu-mi, I can't find a driver.

392
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,512
Can you come pick me up?

393
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:15,657
Hey.

394
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,639
Yes, Ma'am. I'm here out front.

395
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:21,245
Already? Why did you come so soon?

396
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,254
I didn't come early...

397
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:28,197
One friend just came.

398
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:30,778
You didn't eat yet, right?
Come in and eat.

399
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,276
I'm okay.

400
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,116
No one touched that.

401
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,488
I used to hang out with them in the US.

402
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,464
They're professors in Korea now.

403
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:42,903
They have no conscience.

404
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:49,271
See? It's impossible to get a taxi too.

405
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,694
What will you do when I get married?

406
00:41:55,351 --> 00:41:58,148
What do you mean?

407
00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:59,283
Didn't you hear?

408
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:04,234
Mom says she'll rent out the store.

409
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:08,114
Do you mean I have to quit?

410
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,449
No, well...

411
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:16,117
Even if I want to get you a job
at Director Song's gallery,

412
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,133
your academic background comes short.

413
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,406
You should've tried harder.

414
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:30,341
It's so warm.

415
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:55,344
YU-MI, I GOT A PONE. I LEARNED HOW TO TEX.

416
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,484
I MUSS YOU. MOM

417
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:06,556
I'LL VISIT YOU TOMORROW

418
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,025
Why tomorrow?

419
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,324
Can't you start doing better now?

420
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:14,611
Okay, Sir. I'll start right now.

421
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:16,851
Go on.

422
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,722
What is it?

423
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,913
Do you have something to say?

424
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:38,611
Well...

425
00:43:43,504 --> 00:43:47,107
May I have a day off tomorrow?

426
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:50,218
My mother back home...

427
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:06,045
Why are you making me
look like a bad person?

428
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,017
Pardon?

429
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,767
Don't you remember the conditions
for working for us?

430
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:16,445
It's not that--

431
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,404
No, no. Don't try to get away with it.

432
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:23,175
I'm sorry, Sir.
I wasn't thinking straight.

433
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:30,113
Do you think we're easy
now that you know us?

434
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,952
Why don't any of you
ever keep your promises?

435
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:41,302
I don't understand it!

436
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:45,901
Do you know what your problem is?

437
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,297
You're all lazy and stupid,

438
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,503
but you want to live like
everyone else. That's what!

439
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:55,767
Do you want to live like that
for the rest of your life?

440
00:45:24,603 --> 00:45:25,819
Book me a flight.

441
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:30,521
I'll fly out next Wednesday
with a day stopover in Paris.

442
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,274
I'll spend a week in Helsinki.

443
00:45:32,787 --> 00:45:35,046
- Helsinki?
- Yes.

444
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,311
I'm cold and depressed,
so I'll go to a spa.

445
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:44,555
What's the big deal about weddings?
It's dragging and complicated.

446
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:46,220
I'm annoyed.

447
00:45:49,128 --> 00:45:51,867
Don't you pity me?

448
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,571
Pardon?

449
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:57,660
You know...

450
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:02,797
Happiness is always a little vague.

451
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,725
But misfortune is clear.

452
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:09,187
I'm totally unhappy these days.

453
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,032
Yes. Hello?

454
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:15,909
Yes.

455
00:46:17,004 --> 00:46:19,518
If it's a Hilton affiliate,
I have a membership.

456
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:23,440
You do too?

457
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:43,235
Hey. If Mom asks, I'm going with a friend.

458
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:47,669
Don't worry.

459
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:51,164
We met at a gathering,
and we're not serious.

460
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:57,412
Why would I worry about you?

461
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,722
Oh, I'm hungry.

462
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:05,419
Is Mom here?

463
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:22,822
Hey, do you even know
who the current president is?

464
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:25,143
You think so lowly of me.

465
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,570
I have no interest in politics,

466
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:30,622
but you're the worst.

467
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:34,173
Too be honest, who cares?
It's all the same no matter who it is.

468
00:47:34,256 --> 00:47:38,422
That's not the point.
Who's the prime minister? What's his name?

469
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:40,649
- What is it? Tell me.
- Well...

470
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:42,997
Isn't it common knowledge?

471
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,768
The only reason you know his name
is because you're friends with his son.

472
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:49,042
What? No way!

473
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,192
- I'm right.
- No, you're wrong.

474
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,270
Excuse me.

475
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:54,536
What is it?

476
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,513
Your passport expires in a month.

477
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:01,174
Get it reissued.

478
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:09,446
It's something you should know
to do automatically.

479
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,000
Okay.

480
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,205
Get it expedited.

481
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,586
Do I have to tell you everything?

482
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:22,844
No.

483
00:48:31,753 --> 00:48:33,491
She can really get on my nerves.

484
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:39,341
You can go back to work.

485
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,180
That looks delicious.

486
00:48:55,289 --> 00:48:57,222
You're not going anywhere.

487
00:48:57,305 --> 00:48:58,844
Yu-mi is here.

488
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:03,278
It's the end of the year.
We should have a nice time too.

489
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:05,747
She's right. The mafia family is out.

490
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:08,494
Turn off the carol.

491
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,827
It makes me want to throw up every season.

492
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:15,758
I heard Big Director talk earlier,

493
00:49:15,841 --> 00:49:17,716
and Little Director is getting married
next spring.

494
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:21,036
It's taking so long to plan this marriage.

495
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,029
Has it been two years now?

496
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:27,100
They're rich,
but the family isn't that powerful.

497
00:49:27,183 --> 00:49:29,278
- With that hospital owner's son?
- Yes.

498
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:33,647
What is that about? I saw Little Director
get picked up by another guy earlier.

499
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:38,352
Everyone in this family
has dual citizenship.

500
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,597
It's the American way.

501
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:48,941
Yu-mi, were you upset earlier?

502
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,545
Little Director made it worse.

503
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:57,928
One day they tell you you're inflexible,

504
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:59,803
then on another,
they're strict about principles.

505
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:01,525
Why didn't you tell me?

506
00:50:02,964 --> 00:50:06,683
You have to start flattering him
a few days before asking for a day off.

507
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:09,709
It's really hard for us and Yu-mi.

508
00:50:09,792 --> 00:50:11,692
We take turns taking a day off a month.

509
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,420
He's right.

510
00:50:13,503 --> 00:50:16,081
I'm always so tired
the day after we receive a delivery.

511
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,433
He called us stupid and lazy.

512
00:50:32,334 --> 00:50:34,978
I thought about it all day long
after hearing that from him.

513
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:38,153
It offended me too.

514
00:50:38,932 --> 00:50:41,391
Mr. Lee is especially harsh on Yu-mi.

515
00:50:41,474 --> 00:50:44,710
He looked down on her last time
for not having a degree.

516
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:47,535
If they're so educated,

517
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:49,944
why sell stuff from the market?

518
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:51,206
Watch what you say.

519
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,648
We know what Mr. Lee is like.

520
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:56,689
This is how it works in the real world.

521
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:57,952
It's normal.

522
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,845
Ms. Kim.

523
00:51:04,877 --> 00:51:07,463
Does it taste good to drink stolen wine?

524
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:13,241
Do you hear yourself?

525
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:16,497
Don't be like that, Yu-mi.

526
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,725
As for me,

527
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,565
I don't have the courage
to live like this forever.

528
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:26,494
Geez.

529
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,517
So what will you do?

530
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:46,029
I want people to fear me.

531
00:53:23,715 --> 00:53:25,049
I'll take one of these.

532
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:36,502
Wait! Just a minute!

533
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:38,807
Just a minute.

534
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,999
Thank you.

535
00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:45,760
SEOUL TO HONGCHEON

536
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,623
Don't go. Just five more minutes.

537
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:59,218
Wait here.
I'll make you something delicious.

538
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:01,510
Something delicious? Okay

539
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:25,548
22 MISSED CALLS: MARAIS MS. KIM

540
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:30,169

DELETED

543
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:48,401
JI-WON

544
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,705
Hello?

545
00:55:02,223 --> 00:55:03,375
Hello.

546
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:05,192
Yes?

547
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:11,023
Is this Ji-won's number?

548
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:13,360
Yes, it is. Who is this?

549
00:55:15,373 --> 00:55:16,807
It's me, Yu-mi.

550
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:18,811
Yu-mi?

551
00:55:18,894 --> 00:55:20,351
Yes, Yu-mi.

552
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:27,519
So, were you in America all this time?

553
00:55:28,581 --> 00:55:30,686
Yes. I went to school there.

554
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:38,635
Why do you feel so much calmer?

555
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:41,234
I don't think I would've recognized you
on the streets.

556
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:44,236
People aren't as conscious
about other people there.

557
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:47,207
So? Are you back for good?

558
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,453
Yes, I'm back for good.

559
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:53,663
I came back,

560
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:56,732
but I'm not sure where to start.

561
00:56:04,802 --> 00:56:08,188
I see. But I don't know either.

562
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:11,020
I didn't get into
any of the places I wanted.

563
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:13,138
The place I'm at now is tiny.

564
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:18,918
But at least you became a reporter
like you wanted.

565
00:56:20,064 --> 00:56:21,806
It's just my luck.

566
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,787
It takes forever
whenever I try to do something.

567
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,415
It took me two years
to get admitted to our university.

568
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,441
You're just a late bloomer.

569
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:34,153
Actually, I hated this company at first.

570
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:39,319
Oh, well. How I got here isn't important.

571
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:42,556
The issue is how I'll handle it
in the future.

572
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,248
So, what kind of work do you want to do?

573
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:48,582
I have connections.
I work for the alumni association.

574
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:51,910
No, no. I didn't call you
to ask you for a favor.

575
00:56:52,786 --> 00:56:54,743
Do you want to teach kids part-time?

576
00:56:54,826 --> 00:56:56,967
People would welcome
someone like you with open arms.

577
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:02,464
What kind of job is it?

578
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:05,295
I know someone who runs an art academy.

579
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,474
Her academy is big and famous.

580
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:10,438
Your degree is in the arts, right?

581
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,305

ACADEMIC BACKGROUND

583
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:32,171
How I got here isn't important.

584
00:57:32,254 --> 00:57:35,337
The issue is how I'll handle it
in the future.
