1
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:35,107
Thank you.

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,708
SEOUL MAYOR CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON

3
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:45,640
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi JI-hoon!

4
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:51,373
Let's go.

5
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,040
Yes. Thank you.

6
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,058
Thank you.

7
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,984
Thank you.

8
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,170
Thank you.

9
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,338
Good luck, Choi Ji-hoon!

10
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:07,136
Bye.

11
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:19,987
You have a meeting in an hour
with the Secretary for Political Affairs.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,032
I'll take you right to the meeting place.

13
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,159
Also, here.

14
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,902
Here are the interview questions
for tomorrow.

15
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:40,752
You knew from the start,
and you're looking after him even now.

16
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:41,831
Got it?

17
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,913
We purposefully waited
until the bad comments reached its height.

18
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,338
You can cry a little too.

19
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,283
If you can't make yourself to cry,
it's fine.

20
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,458
The candidates continue on
with their enthusiastic campaigns.

21
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,065
He's getting more malicious comments
ever since the news about his son,

22
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,845
but the number of supporters grew.

23
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,586
Becoming the mayor isn't his goal.

24
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,358
He'll start preparing
for the presidential election now.

25
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,855
I wish the elections would end soon.

26
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:20,388
Same. So many people are sacrificing

27
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,561
to get him that title.

28
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:26,175
Do you think it's really him
that got him so popular?

29
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:29,003
If you look up on the Internet,
people only talk about Anna.

30
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:34,578
Right,
you're interviewing Anna tomorrow, right?

31
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,684
- What?
- That's right.

32
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,518
I'll finally get to meet her in person.

33
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,619
Anna's lipstick is trending right now.

34
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,640
YSL Vol... What is that?

35
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:47,752
Volupte.

36
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,645
I know. Volupte Shimmer.

37
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,991
- Shine.
- Shine.

38
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:54,883
They're optimized to receive attention.

39
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,595
Whenever Anna changes her outfit,
someone will write an article.

40
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,883
She has three million Instagram followers.

41
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,428
I'm one of them.

42
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:08,021
Hey. Is she always that graceful?

43
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:12,123
Right.
How come you never write about Anna?

44
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,499
Are you stupid?

45
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:15,699
Because I know her.

46
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,222
Is that so?

47
00:03:17,305 --> 00:03:19,878
How professional you are.

48
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,984
She has such upright work ethics.

49
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,404
- Are they at it again?
- You're right.

50
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:24,709
Should we praise you for that?

51
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:46,489
The Secretary for Political Affairs
will be 20 minutes late.

52
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:47,510
Okay.

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,262
You must think I don't know anything

54
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,541
since I feign ignorance.

55
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:12,280
No, I know you're a good actress.

56
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:15,889
On our wedding day,

57
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:21,055
we took a picture with your nephew
named Choi Min-jae.

58
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,911
Yes. When I think about it now,

59
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,703
it was definitely strange.

60
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:31,973
And also,

61
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,623
Im Soo-yeon is nowhere to be found.

62
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:37,644
Hey.

63
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:45,407
Ms. Lee Yu-mi,
the daughter of Baekma Tailor's mute.

64
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:54,149
Did you suddenly become curious
about the truth?

65
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,736
Im Soo-yeon was a kind person

66
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,519
who sacrificed herself for you for years.

67
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,323
She apparently went to Jeju Island

68
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,876
right after giving birth,
and was found dead from falling.

69
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,539
How did that happen?

70
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,168
Was it really an accident?

71
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,644
You must have nothing to fear

72
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,359
now that Lee Hyun-joo is gone.

73
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,792
Does it look like that?

74
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,964
I'm glad you noticed.

75
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:49,195
Do you know how tiring it was for me
because of Hyun-joo?

76
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,827
All you needed was for her to disappear.

77
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,895
And I made that happen for you.

78
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:07,071
But still,
how could you do that to someone?

79
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,768
You even changed your name
to live like her.

80
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,558
Why are you complaining?

81
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:18,021
I see.

82
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:26,025
Are you saying I'm just complaining?

83
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,816
Didn't you want that woman dead?

84
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,130
You're an accomplice anyway.

85
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,964
Just a minute.

86
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,451
Let's be good, okay?

87
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,397
Come in.

88
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,387
Secretary Lee Chang-yong is here.

89
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,507
Gosh, I'm late.

90
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,855
Sorry. I was suddenly called by the VIP.

91
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,542
That's okay, Sir. We just arrived too.

92
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,623
Really?

93
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,071
Honey, say hello.

94
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,193
Nice to meet you.

95
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:20,304
Please sit down.

96
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,639
How do you feel
with the election around the corner?

97
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,134
CHOI JI-HOON CRIES FOR STRONGER SEOUL
PROMISES TO BUILD A HAPPY CITY

98
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,363
CHOI JI-HOON CRIES FOR STRONGER SEOUL
PROMISES TO BUILD A HAPPY CITY

99
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,743
CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON AND WIFE LEE ANNA
POUR THEIR ALL INTO THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN

100
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,688
What?

101
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:02,433
The rumor about a ghostwriter
writing my thesis isn't important to me.

102
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:08,215
I think some people
want it to be the truth,

103
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,510
but there's no reason
for me to explain myself anymore.

104
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,942
I can handle such a gossip.

105
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,576
But

106
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,837
having a sick child

107
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:33,189
become a part of this controversy
is hard to bear.

108
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,158
My husband and I

109
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:42,993
will not let such speculations and rumors
about the birth mother bother us,

110
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:47,190
and we won't be taking any legal measures

111
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,739
against Hanbit Daily either.

112
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:57,123
We believe the voters will be able to see
our family's sincerity.

113
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,095
Are we done?

114
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,148
Yes.

115
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,341
Thank you for your time.

116
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,557
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

117
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:27,913
It seems like Professor Lee
accepted some money.

118
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,276
From whom?

119
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,023
What is this?

120
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:46,372
"Lee So-hyun, Lee Bo-ram, Han Ji-hye..."

121
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,909
How much is all this?

122
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,116
What we were able to find out
seems to add up to 2.7 billion won.

123
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,062
Do you mean there might be more?

124
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:00,125
Yes.

125
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,845
She's trying to pull a trick.

126
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,771
Is she preparing to fight me?

127
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,409
- Pull over.
- Yes, Sir.

128
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:27,885
Get out.

129
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:34,100
DR. LEE JAE-EOL

130
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,936
Hello, Dr. Lee.

131
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:47,105
Are you well?

132
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:49,127
Yes.

133
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:51,586
Things are hectic, of course.

134
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,585
It's nothing much,

135
00:11:55,668 --> 00:12:01,356
but my wife
is emotionally unstable these days.

136
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:05,847
Yes, yes.

137
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:09,150
It impacts her daily life.

138
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,159
It's election season,

139
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,448
so let's wait until after.

140
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:23,806
I want her to take a break
somewhere quiet.

141
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,751
Getting her admitted would be good too.

142
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:30,439
BUILDING SEOUL'S FUTURE TOGETHER,
LEAVE IT TO CHOI JI-HOON

143
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,736
I like this one. What about you?

144
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,724
I like this one too.

145
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,692
It's hard to pick one
since you only took nice pictures.

146
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,506
You're too kind.
It's because you're beautiful.

147
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,924
I heard you're very close
with Reporter Han.

148
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:55,071
We're not that close.

149
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,008
Is she well?

150
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,866
Yes. I don't know what she's up to
but she's really busy these days.

151
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,175
Really?

152
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,800
It's been a while since I saw her too.

153
00:13:17,813 --> 00:13:21,161
You didn't know
what Professor Lee was up to?

154
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:24,807
She didn't meet that many people

155
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,504
while I was escorting her.

156
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:31,969
When she met with Madam Lee So-hyun,

157
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:35,514
I thought it was a bit strange,
but I had no idea.

158
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:39,528
You should've reported it
if you found it strange.

159
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:44,248
To be honest, I can't do anything

160
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,094
if she goes out without telling me.

161
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,887
Why can't you do anything?

162
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,245
Do you hear yourself?

163
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,565
Are you a civil servant
who only does what you're told?

164
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:01,178
This is why we shouldn't have picked
a woman to join our team.

165
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,978
She knows very well

166
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,954
I was ordered by Mr. Choi to watch her.

167
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,323
She would never do things like that
out in the open for me to notice.

168
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,239
Darn it. Shut your mouth.

169
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,934
You'll be responsible for this.

170
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,050
Write a written apology

171
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:30,013
and make a copy of her phone.

172
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:36,731
Also,

173
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:42,990
we received two calls today
asking if Lee Anna is her real name.

174
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,219
Check them.

175
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,536
HIDDEN LOVE OF LEE ANNA,
THE WIFE OF CANDIDATE CHOI JI-HOON

176
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,229
- What's with this comment?
- Isn't it crazy?

177
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,268
Scroll down.

178
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:58,379
How compassionate.

179
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:02,429
People can be so simple.

180
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:09,197
Do you think that interview was sincere?

181
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:12,954
You're so inflexible.

182
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,727
It doesn't matter
as long as it speaks to people.

183
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,238
Did you find her beautiful in person?

184
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,104
Yes.

185
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,514
I can see why people like her so much.

186
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,767
She smiled at me
and my heart skipped a beat.

187
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,359
- Right?
- Yes.

188
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,654
Hurry up and join her fan club.

189
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:31,724
I should.

190
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,327
I was going to sell your name
to get close to her,

191
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,221
but she told me she doesn't know you well.

192
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,725
See?

193
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,677
I told you we're not close.

194
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:52,669
I'm off.

195
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,227
Bye.

196
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,042
You have arrived at your destination.

197
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:53,715
Mom.

198
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:06,836
My daughter is in the US.

199
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,489
Can you help me write a letter to her?

200
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:15,484
I cannot talk,

201
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,544
so I can't call her.

202
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:33,280
What would you like me to write?

203
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:36,422
That her mom

204
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:41,331
misses Yu-mi.

205
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,424
IS THIS THE RIGHT THING TO DO?
IS THIS SOMETHING I CAN HANDLE?

206
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,265
Who is it?

207
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,647
Ji-won.

208
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:22,583
It's me, Yu-mi.

209
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,446
Yu-mi.

210
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,265
I'm sorry I came over so early.

211
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:36,151
It's okay.

212
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,521
Come in.

213
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,631
This is so awkward.

214
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,613
I don't know where I should start.

215
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,486
Maybe how Lee Yu-mi became Anna?

216
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,245
So you know everything.

217
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:28,705
I was really confused at first,

218
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,516
but I was able to put things together.

219
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:35,622
When I thought about it,
there wasn't a single thing

220
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,325
I knew about you.

221
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,023
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:43,324
Why did you do that?

223
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:50,511
It's hard to explain.

224
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:58,087
Not all who had a hard time growing up
live like you.

225
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,190
I tried my best,

226
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,622
but it didn't work out.

227
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:08,636
Is that all?

228
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:13,128
I envied

229
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,111
Lee Hyun-joo.

230
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:27,926
Since Lee Anna is someone
who is influential in our society,

231
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,493
I decided to tell the world about you.

232
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,211
Before, I was afraid

233
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,090
of being found out.

234
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,390
But not anymore.

235
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,941
I want you to write about me

236
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,652
and let the Prosecution know too.

237
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:10,620
What is this?

238
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:13,948
The story

239
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:18,371
of Lee Anna and Choi Ji-hoon.

240
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,283
Lee Hyun-joo didn't commit suicide.

241
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:28,555
Ji-hoon's previous wife Im Soo-yeon
didn't have an accidental death either.

242
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:34,908
Stock manipulation,
embezzlement, and dodging taxes.

243
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,517
VICTIM, WITNESS

244
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,445
There is a list
of the bribes Lee Anna accepted too.

245
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:44,244
You'll be surprised once you open it.

246
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:48,601
Choi Ji-hoon's son,

247
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,513
and Lee Anna's ghostwriter...

248
00:21:52,254 --> 00:21:53,891
I tried to expose them myself,

249
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,880
but I was stopped.

250
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:02,270
You were the one?

251
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:03,806
Yes.

252
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:10,424
I think it would be best to use it
just after the election,

253
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:13,132
but before his post starts
when his guards are down.

254
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:18,222
Why are you giving this to me?

255
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,263
Because

256
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:29,782
you're the only one who called me by Yu-mi

257
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:34,199
and worried about me.

258
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:39,967
This is my apology to you and Hyun-joo.

259
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:51,191
You'll lose everything.
It'll be hard to bear.

260
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:55,542
I'm

261
00:22:58,227 --> 00:22:59,886
prepared for it now.

262
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:07,676
I think I got this far

263
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,424
so I could break down like this.

264
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,462
You might get sentenced to serve time.

265
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,581
Don't worry.

266
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:31,909
I'll survive on my own.

267
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:43,095
If anything ever happens to me,

268
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,841
could you take care of that patient
for me?

269
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:52,304
What do you mean?

270
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,246
I don't know.

271
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,444
I'm trying not to think about it.

272
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:04,619
They say people become cowardly
because they have imagination.

273
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,092
Yes, Ma'am.

274
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:20,133
You shouldn't get timid
in front of your parents either.

275
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,301
You become independent
once you stop feeling guilty

276
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:28,235
about disappointing your parents.

277
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:36,557
That's what I regret the most.

278
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:46,036
I really didn't have much expectation,

279
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,108
but the concept was great.
It's really catchy.

280
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,912
It was Professor Yoon
who went through a lot.

281
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,642
I was so surprised.

282
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,522
I'm thankful that you noticed.

283
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:02,132
Exactly. That gallery
didn't have a single famous piece,

284
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:05,366
but you got 9,000 people in just a month.
That's quite a feat.

285
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,046
It's thanks to the good art.

286
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:10,182
It's an accomplishment
at this slow period.

287
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:14,287
To be honest,
we benefited from Professor Lee's fame.

288
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,492
Not at all.

289
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,815
The election is just around the corner.

290
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:21,939
You must be busy with the exhibition
and the campaign.

291
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,476
I'm busy,

292
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,242
but a lot of people are helping me,
so it's not too hard.

293
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:31,379
There are seven people helping her
with the exhibition.

294
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:32,683
I see.

295
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,531
I heard you're preparing an exhibition
of Kim Jeong-hui's works for Sarim Museum.

296
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:39,848
Really?

297
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,961
I rejected twice, but they pleaded me.

298
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,958
I see.

299
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,203
- I look forward to it.
- That's amazing.

300
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:49,401
Wow.

301
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,039
Hello, Professor Lee.

302
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,660
It's the recommendation letter for Yale
you asked for.

303
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,028
Gosh.

304
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:05,071
Professor Joseph will know who it's from
when he receives it.

305
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:07,077
I'll send him a message too.

306
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,751
Professor Lee, thank you so much.

307
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:12,152
I'm indebted to you.

308
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:14,603
Gosh, I feel so blessed.

309
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,488
A recommendation letter
is just supplementary.

310
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,256
Don't depend on it and prepare your best.

311
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,411
- You should thank her.
- Thank you.

312
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:25,802
Thank you.

313
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:32,351
Now, with my wife who is always beside me
and backing me up,

314
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:34,558
we'll say our goodbyes to you together.

315
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:41,523
We hope to meet all of you here again.

316
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,432
We love you. Thank you.

317
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:50,256
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

318
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,592
Candidate Choi Ji-hoon
and his wife Lee Anna

319
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:02,097
visited a nearby voting station
this morning

320
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,412
to cast their votes
and greeted other voters.

321
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,919
Yes. It was difficult
to run the election campaign,

322
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,150
but I have no regrets
since I gave it my all.

323
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:12,253
Thank you for your support...

324
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:13,324
Hey, Han Ji-won.

325
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:16,521
- Yes?
- Come here for a second.

326
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,157
Thank you.

327
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,245
CHOI JI-HOON AND WIFE LEE ANNA
VOTE TOGETHER

328
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,345
Is something bothering you?

329
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,260
I feel uneasy.

330
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:50,010
Pardon?

331
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:55,819
As of today, you're fired.

332
00:27:56,903 --> 00:28:00,610
What? What do you mean?

333
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:03,015
You must have known

334
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:05,887
the work you were doing

335
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:08,165
would have to come to an end.

336
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:18,144
To be honest, I didn't trust you at first.

337
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,072
Thank you for keeping your promise.

338
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,179
I couldn't understand you at first,

339
00:28:32,935 --> 00:28:36,253
but I believe what you're doing is right.

340
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,517
I'll be taken in by Prosecution
tomorrow afternoon.

341
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,257
Then,

342
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:50,580
you'll be put in an awkward position.

343
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,225
I'll serve you until the very end.

344
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,466
No matter who you are,
you're still my employer.

345
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,602
You're going to regret it.

346
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:22,133
Although I'm weak,

347
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,600
I want to stay loyal.

348
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,243
"Loyal"?

349
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,905
I've never

350
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,363
been loyal to anyone.

351
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:47,078
Next, we'll check
who are in 1st and 2nd places by province.

352
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:51,923
In the Gyeonggi region,
Choi Yeon-duk is ahead by a narrow margin.

353
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:54,746
Next is Gyeongnam.

354
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,593
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

355

MOM'S NURSING HOME

356
00:30:01,772 --> 00:30:03,186
Ulsan.

357
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,191
Han Duk-soo
of the Democratic Unionist Party...

358
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,406
Hello?

359
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:11,080
Patient Yoon Hong-ju
is asking for you, Ms. Lee Yu-mi.

360
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,539
I don't think she'll last very long.

361
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:17,486
Innovative Seoul, Choi Ji-hoon!

362
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,562
Innovative Seoul, Choi Ji-hoon!

363
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,831
- The Seoul mayor.
- Innovative Seoul, Choi Ji-hoon!

364
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:22,948
We won!

365
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:31,016
CHOI JI-HOON ELECTED AS SEOUL MAYOR
50.4 PERCENT

366
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:35,151
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

367
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,947
Congratulations.

368
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:45,529
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

369
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:54,432
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

370
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:03,560
Congratulations!

371
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,413
Dear respected Seoul citizens.

372
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,331
Thank you so much
for your enthusiastic support.

373
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:18,400
I want to thank everyone who worked hard

374
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:20,637
to support me until the very end.

375
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:24,493
In addition to considering my supporters,

376
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:27,541
I'll also keep in mind
of those who did not support me

377
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,671
to build an innovative Seoul

378
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:34,046
that is full of opportunities
for everyone.

379
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,201
- Hey, Ji-won.
- Yes?

380
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,099
You're on standby at the airport
tomorrow morning.

381
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:40,586
- It's an early morning flight.
- Okay.

382
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:42,675
Mayor Choi Ji-hoon's unique comment...

383
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:46,527
Why doesn't he take a break?
That Choi Ji-hoon never gets tired.

384
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,000
I couldn't be with my son
because of the election,

385
00:31:50,955 --> 00:31:54,281
so we'll go get him now.

386
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,957
YU-MI: WHEN JI-HOON GETS ON THE FLIGHT
TO AMERICA TOMORROW MORNING,

387
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,547
THAT MIGHT BE OUR CHANCE

388
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:05,223
First, Gyeonggi-do.

389
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:07,822
Votes counted so far is 72.3 percent.

390
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:09,828
Democratic Unionist Party's Choi Yeon-duk

391
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:13,974
is 12.3 percent ahead
of candidate Kim Han-jun.

392
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,412
He is the probable candidate.

393
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,093
Next up is the Incheon mayor.

394
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,585
Ballot-counting has finished.

395
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,311
Democratic Republican Party's Kim Hyun-soo

396
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:25,634
won the election with 57.2 percent.

397
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:34,882
Hello?

398
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:37,234
Are you Prosecutor Lee Duk-chan?

399
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,356
Thank you for your work.

400
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,092
Gosh.

401
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:51,244
You can head for the airport in two hours.

402
00:32:52,218 --> 00:32:53,465
Why so early?

403
00:32:53,548 --> 00:32:55,263
Isn't the flight schedule for 7:00 a.m?

404
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,662
We expect a lot of reporters
at the airport,

405
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,555
so it would be best to go early.

406
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:03,599
Can you change the return flight
to include a transfer?

407
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,417
It's tiring to handle the press.

408
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,897
The place Min-jae is at
is quite far from San Francisco.

409
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,419
It'll be tiring
to drive the car yourself...

410
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:13,827
The distance is about the same
from here to Busan, right?

411
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:19,043
It's okay.
I traveled across the States before.

412
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,957
You can go.

413
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,330
Mayor, congratulations!

414
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,010
Thank you.

415
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,563
Congratulations, Professor Lee.

416
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:35,067
- Go. Hurry up and go now.
- Okay.

417
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,185
Go and rest. Go.

418
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,784
How tiring.

419
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:27,104
Congratulations
on getting what you wanted.

420
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:36,408
But

421
00:34:38,532 --> 00:34:40,201
I have to leave right now.

422
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:43,827
Where to?

423
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,479
My mom is in a critical state.

424
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,066
Your mom is in the UK.

425
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:59,120
Jerk.

426
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:03,296
I'm joking.

427
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:11,440
But you know, now is not a good time.

428
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:15,783
Wait.

429
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:19,968
Geez.

430
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,763
Basement level one.

431
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,329
The door's opening.

432
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:28,848
Mr. Jung.

433
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:35,146
Send someone to Hana Nursing Home
in Gangwon-do right now.

434
00:35:36,213 --> 00:35:37,188
Yes.

435
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,599
- Send Ms. Cho.
- The door's closing.

436
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,198
Okay.

437
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:43,474
Twenty-third floor.

438
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:46,486
Out of the way!

439
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:50,643
Move back!

440
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:51,850
He's coming out!

441
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,594
Please say a few words!

442
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:57,659
- Move!
- When are you coming back?

443
00:35:58,783 --> 00:36:00,334
Stop pushing!

444
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,434
Move, move.

445
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:21,591
Do not swarm around, it's dangerous!

446
00:36:21,674 --> 00:36:22,765
Please let them pass.

447
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,511
Reporters, please make way.

448
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,607
Passing through.

449
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,166
Move your head! Geez.

450
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:31,290
Passing through.

451
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,104
It's dangerous, step aside.

452
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,039
Our plane is prepared to depart.

453
00:36:38,122 --> 00:36:41,151
Please fasten your seat belts

454
00:36:41,234 --> 00:36:44,444
and switch your electronic devices
to airplane mode.

455
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,570
MS. CHO

456
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:57,802
Hello?

457
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,595
Professor Lee.

458
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:02,873
Ms. Yoon Hong-ju who was in her 70s

459
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,703
passed away this morning

460
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:08,341
at 6:54 a.m.

461
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:30,656
Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take off soon.

462
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:07,437
Honey, give me your passport.

463
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:13,279
Why?

464
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:16,308
They need it for the insurance.

465
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,027
Let's go.

466
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:24,227
JI-WON: THE PROSECUTOR IS READY,
BUT SOMEONE AT THE TOP IS STOPPING US

467
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,444
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 14 HOURS,
BUT THEY WON'T LET ME SEE HIM

468
00:39:41,305 --> 00:39:42,332
Are you tired?

469
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:48,388
I gave it a bit of thought,

470
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,900
and I think it'd be best
for you to take a break.

471
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,422
My schedule was packed,
but I pushed to make this happen.

472
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,381
We didn't come here
to get Min-jae, did we?

473
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:15,877
When the news on him went out last time,

474
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,790
I moved him to Australia.

475
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:29,749
Stop the car and give me back my passport.

476
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,467
It's a newly built place,

477
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:41,548
so the facilities are nice
and the surrounding view is beautiful.

478
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:47,041
Where?

479
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:48,503
You know,

480
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:54,407
when one focuses on oneself too much,

481
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,121
you can get depressed.

482
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:01,155
You should go where the air is nice

483
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:05,222
and take a break
while thinking things over.

484
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,995
You've never been to the US before, right?

485
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:37,845
PROSECUTOR LEE DUK-CHAN

486
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:15,676
Shoot. Darn it.

487
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,542
Darn it.

488
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,767
Hey!

489
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:32,878
Hey, come here and grab this.

490
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:35,871
Lee Anna.

491
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,143
Darn it.

492
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:43,928
Damn it!

493
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,994
JI-WON: YU-MI,
I DON'T THINK PROSECUTION WILL HELP

494
00:45:49,077 --> 00:45:51,577
I'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE

495
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,458
Darn it.

496
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:57,951
Hey!

497
00:45:58,034 --> 00:45:59,964
Anna, what are you doing?

498
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:04,036
Come back here!

499
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,020
The thing with people is that

500
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,915
they lie even in the diary
no one else reads.

501
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,646
But the truth is simple

502
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:17,485
and lies are complicated.

503
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,610
Anyone who knows the reason to live

504
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:26,144
can endure any situation.

505
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,464
It's dangerous. Get down!

506
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:44,711
It's dangerous!

507
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,030
Darn it.

508
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,341
Hey! Hey.

509
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:06,768
Darn.

510
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:08,847
SOO-MI'S PORK BONE SOUP

511
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:13,140
Lee Yu-mi!

512
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:15,917
If you endure it all,

513
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:19,397
the chance will definitely come.

514
00:47:20,994 --> 00:47:22,347
It has always been like that.

515
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:28,071
I always do everything

516
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:29,197
I set my mind to.

517
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:05,877
Hey.

518
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:08,959
Hey, you!

519
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:13,495
Darn it!

520
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:27,098
Step back!

521
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:43,978
At 6:10 a.m. local time

522
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:46,409
on Route 50, California,

523
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:50,059
Seoul Mayor Choi Ji-hoon was found dead.

524
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:54,517
The rental car Choi was in
had completely burned down.

525
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,541
A search to find
the whereabouts of his wife Lee Anna,

526
00:48:57,624 --> 00:49:00,631
who is presumed to have accompanied him,
is ongoing.

527
00:49:00,714 --> 00:49:02,004
SEOUL MAYOR CHOI JI-HOON FOUND DEAD,
WIFE LEE ANNA MISSING

528
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:08,417
What?

529
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,384
And?

530
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:25,406
MEMORIAL ALTAR
FOR SEOUL MAYOR CHOI JI-HOON

531
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:27,525
What is this?

532
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:34,890
He doesn't have any mourners.

533
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:37,799
Everyone else aside from us is reporters

534
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:41,382
although the family waited almost a month
to hold the big man's funeral.

535
00:49:41,971 --> 00:49:44,109
Those associated with him must be scared.

536
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,132
Even the public prosecutor was booted.
Who would dare to come here?

537
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:51,254
That's true.

538
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,496
I bet Lee Anna killed him.

539
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:03,198
- She's really something.
- That's impossible.

540
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:06,060
I met her in person, so I know.
There's no way she would do that.

541
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:09,936
She has guts.

542
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:11,621
She's out of her mind.

543
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:17,007
Right, there's one more woman who's crazy.

544
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:20,309
You know,
Bokuk Daily's ambitious Han Ji-won.

545
00:50:21,074 --> 00:50:23,942
I heard she'll work
for a major station's news now.

546
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:25,356
- Really?
- Yes.

547
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,570
But I heard she's crazy.

548
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:31,221
That reminds me.

549
00:50:32,531 --> 00:50:35,035
She's close with Lee Anna.

550
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:37,697
Geez.

551
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,321
Women are so scary these days.

552
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,647
They're spiteful.

553
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:44,537
What a spiteful woman.

554
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,137
It's ridiculous.

555
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:54,160
So, how is your new place?

556
00:50:54,243 --> 00:50:55,206
Well,

557
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:58,942
I get a lot of sunlight.

558
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:01,952
It ventilates well,
and the water pressure is good.

559
00:51:02,035 --> 00:51:04,821
Right. My furnace is brand new.

560
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:05,994
New is good.

561
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:07,779
Furnace...

562
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,224
Are you that happy?

563
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:14,960
The thing is, these are bare necessities

564
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:17,560
a person needs to live.

565
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:19,679
- That's true.
- So

566
00:51:19,762 --> 00:51:23,130
I don't know why I'm so moved by it.

567
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:26,918
Having money is the best.

568
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,955
Money is great.

569
00:51:29,038 --> 00:51:31,287
You skipped over three pay grades.

570
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,227
Now you get twice as much money.
It must be great.

571
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,033
It is. It's totally great.

572
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:42,455
But you still regret turning down
a major station, right?

573
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,555
Long time ago,

574
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:52,348
someone told me I wouldn't last
while doing things the way I do.

575
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,039
But I'll endure it and tough it out.

576
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:03,501
I'll keep on writing exclusives
and boast around.

577
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,941
That would be so annoying to watch.
You'll be hated.

578
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:08,481
Well, it's not any different
from when I got hired through connections.

579
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,883
I'll just hang in there.

580
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,098
Okay. Hang in there.

581
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:16,211
- I'll do it well.
- Okay.

582
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:20,469
After four years of investigation,

583
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:23,836
the search for Malaysia Airlines 370
it will come to a close this month.

584
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:28,996
MH370 first disappeared on March 8th, 2014
at 10:00 a.m...

585
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,313
Do you think Lee Anna is still alive?

586
00:52:32,845 --> 00:52:34,986
While heading for Beijing, China,

587
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,203
it made a sharp turn to the Southwest

588
00:52:38,286 --> 00:52:41,305
before the aircraft disappeared
from the tracking system.

589
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:03,349
Are you well?

590
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:42,531
Why did you come all the way out here?

591
00:55:42,614 --> 00:55:45,088
You might run into a bear.
