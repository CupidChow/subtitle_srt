1
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:45,889
Hey, Yu-mi!

2
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,455
Hi, Sun-woo.

3
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:51,748
It's been a while.

4
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,411
Yes, it's been a while.

5
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,405
Don't be awkward.

6
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:04,744
I don't know about the others,
but I understand you.

7
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:08,781
You knew, didn't you?

8
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:11,200
About what?

9
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,119
Little Director's passport.

10
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:16,224
She had to go to the embassy in person
since it's an American passport.

11
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:18,481
Right...

12
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:23,541
What are you doing in this side of town?

13
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,694
Why else do you think I'd be here
during work hours?

14
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:28,261
Big Director sent me to buy some cheese.

15
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:32,024
- Are you well?
- It's the same for me.

16
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:35,323
Things turned tense after you left.

17
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:39,323
Ms. Kim got an earful,

18
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,843
but when Little Director's wedding date
was set,

19
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,449
things suddenly turned for the better.

20
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:46,268
When Little Director
gets married next week,

21
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,608
she'll go straight to the US
with her husband.

22
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,929
It's so hectic because of the wedding.

23
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:55,017
You must be going somewhere today.

24
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,329
I have an important meeting.

25
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,066
Anna,

26
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,752
your academic background is so strong.

27
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:19,142
Usually, people like you
don't work for academies.

28
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:23,681
It hasn't been long

29
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:26,040
since I moved back to Korea from the US.

30
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,410
I feel like I should do something,

31
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,878
but I'm not used to it yet
and I'm still adjusting.

32
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,998
Yes, I heard from Ji-won.

33
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:40,670
I don't have much experience...

34
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:44,032
You got practical and theoretical.
You even have a master's degree.

35
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,885
Your background is more than enough.

36
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:50,853
To be honest, the instructor's
academic background is important.

37
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:55,258
So many people study abroad now,
so I'm not any special.

38
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,794
More than anything,

39
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,747
I'd trust someone Ji-won introduced to me.

40
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,178
Not many people are so honest
and sincere these days.

41
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,753
When can you start?

42
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,730
LUXURY GOODS CONSIGNMENT DEALER

43
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,024
Hello.

44
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,228
You came back so soon.

45
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,599
You kept the clothes clean.

46
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,859
Please come again.
I'll give you good deals.

47
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:48,817
Okay.

48
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,128
Excuse me.

49
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:56,631
Do you think I could sell this?
It's a watch.

50
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,135
Vincent and Co.?

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,063
What's wrong?

52
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:08,559
Did you buy it yourself?

53
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,070
No, I got it as a gift.

54
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:15,123
Actually,

55
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:20,481
it was on the news
4 or 5 years ago for fraud.

56
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:21,750
Didn't you know?

57
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,072
I heard it's from Switzerland,
and that it costs eight million won.

58
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,603
I even have the warranty.

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,351
It's made in China,
but they added a screw in Switzerland

60
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:33,941
so they could say it was made there.

61
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,039
It's worth 100,000 won,
but was sold for 8 or 10 million won.

62
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,323
It's a scam.

63
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,326
I just got it a few months ago.

64
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:46,934
If you got it recently,
that person is really nasty.

65
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,038
I'm sure they knew about it.

66
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,410
What are you looking at?

67
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:09,464
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

68
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,867
"YU-MI" IS GRANTED THE PERMISSION
TO CHANGE HER NAME TO "ANNA"

69
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:21,311
"YU-MI" IS GRANTED THE PERMISSION
TO CHANGE HER NAME TO "ANNA"

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,558
Are you the one who called earlier?

71
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,729
My younger sibling is planning
to study abroad,

72
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,558
so I'm researching.

73
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:32,818
Schools abroad are different.
It's not about who's better...

74
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:35,954
But rather, if you're prepared to study.

75
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,378
The portfolio counts for about 20 percent.

76
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:40,649
The artwork and essay
are the two they look at.

77
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:42,690
How well one draws or paints

78
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:44,320
only counts for domestic admissions.

79
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,352
Is it possible to sit in on a class?

80
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:48,445
Of course.

81
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,717
The class might not seem like much,

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,979
but it's a process to help them
think actively and to discover.

83
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,531
This is more so the case
ever since conceptual art came into play.

84
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,907
Techniques have no value.

85
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:11,168
- Your writing and your art...
- Must show emotions.

86
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:14,580
They take into consideration
that everyone...

87
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,401
Takes different paths.

88
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,684
What's more important
than working for a long time...

89
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,125
Is to find a new perspective on your own.

90
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,986
This is what the school wants.

91
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,715
This is what the school wants.

92
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,386
What professors want
is to hear the story behind your artwork.

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,568
I understand that,

94
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,214
but I don't get
how I can find a new perspective.

95
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,830
It's okay. Don't feel rushed.

96
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,541
My English mark hasn't improved
in over a year.

97
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,845
Ga-eun got into CalArts
after just six months of prep.

98
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,254
Did you want to beat her?

99
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:57,491
To be honest, she was lucky.

100
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:00,891
It's not that she's talented.

101
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,126
How long did you prepare
before you went to school in the US?

102
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:09,782
Na-rae.

103
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,216
When one feels unhappy,

104
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,264
that's when they become
more interested in others.

105
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,033
I used to be unhappy
because of other people too.

106
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,802
Now, I just wait for my chance.

107
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,440
I don't believe in luck anymore.

108
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:31,325
Don't mind other people.

109
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,011
Think only about yourself.

110
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,973
You got a very high score
on your level test.

111
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:41,285
Did you ever take English lessons?

112
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:44,045
No, it's my first time
taking an English course.

113
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,806
I took TOEIC test once before
and got about 900.

114
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,787
That's a great score.

115
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,975
People who are used to studying
catch up fast.

116
00:07:55,677 --> 00:07:59,188
I'd like to focus on speaking, and learn
from a native British English speaker.

117
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,153
- British English?
- Yes.

118
00:08:01,236 --> 00:08:04,121
I learned British English
when I was young.

119
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:07,007
Okay. I see.

120
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,845
I'll prepare the application.
Please wait a moment.

121
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,432
Yu-mi, it's your neighbor
from Ttangjib Restaurant.

122
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,841
Hello. Did something happen?

123
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:27,113
It's nothing much,
but you should pay a visit.

124
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,137
They're redeveloping the market area.

125
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,450
The tailor's will get compensation.

126
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,696
A redevelopment?

127
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,789
I'm so hungry. Super hungry.

128
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:42,848
Thank you.

129
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,717
It's 3:00 p.m.

130
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,007
Why didn't you eat until now?

131
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,219
Don't even get me started.

132
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,584
I went to a police station first thing
this morning, and just came out.

133
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,815
They were transferring that suspect
behind the noraebang murder case today.

134
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,950
Aren't you in the politics department?

135
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,773
No, not yet.

136
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,190
People with little experience like me
have to do everything we're asked.

137
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,636
It must be tough.

138
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,262
It's okay. I'll become one soon.

139
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:14,767
What about you? How's the academy?

140
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,202
Ms. Park said nice things about you.

141
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,284
She's nice to me. The kids are great too.

142
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,163
By the way, do you have two names?

143
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,613
That? It's the name I used in the US.

144
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,647
I changed my name to match the degree
when I renounced my citizenship.

145
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,117
Really? I had no idea.

146
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,706
Anna?

147
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,004
Anna. Lee Anna.

148
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:46,347
Lee Yu-mi. Anna. I can't get used to it.

149
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,625
Right.

150
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,130
This is a gift for you.

151
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:54,336
I should have given it to you earlier.
I'm a bit late.

152
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,756
Are you crazy? You're crazy!

153
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,753
You don't make enough a month
to buy this for me.

154
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,265
It's nothing much.

155
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:08,767
Gosh. Are you serious?

156
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,735
I never received
something like this before.

157
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:18,934
It's so pretty. Darn it.

158
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,431
Thank you. I'll use it well.

159
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,666
Come in.

160
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:44,289
Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest.

161
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,393
This is Professor Yoon So-young.

162
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:50,907
Don't you know her? She's your senior.

163
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:52,774
Sorry?

164
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,063
She's the instructor I told you about.

165
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,487
She probably doesn't know me

166
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,536
since she started school
the same year I graduated.

167
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,653
I see.

168
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,619
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

169
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:07,854
There's no need to apologize. Sit down.

170
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:08,919
Please sit down.

171
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,682
I have a class.

172
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,066
Please have a nice chat.

173
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:16,329
Let's meet again...

174
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,658
next time.

175
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,023
It's my first time seeing her in person.

176
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,870
There were rumors about her
among the Korean students.

177
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:34,935
Rumors?

178
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:36,646
She was quite famous.

179
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,437
Was it Pyeongchang-dong or Seongbuk-dong?

180
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,086
One rumor said she's rich in real estate.

181
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:47,253
I figured she's not from
an ordinary family by her clothes.

182
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,317
She got admitted with donations,
and paid her way out too.

183
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:55,553
She was famous for being a party girl.

184
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,054
I don't believe it.

185
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:00,711
Is she that rich?

186
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:03,632
That's why a lot of people
from her year don't know her.

187
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,239
She doesn't come
to the reunions in Korea either.

188
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,373
Really?

189
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:10,377
Her nickname was...

190
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,801
Unicorn.

191
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,600
She had a separate group
she hung out with.

192
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,584
But she's so diligent at work.

193
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,328
She's really good.

194
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,312
That's amazing.

195
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:28,518
She has the money and education,
so why is she here?

196
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,069
Hey, it's you.

197
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:42,921
You should take this for 90,000 won.

198
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:45,270
I'll give you a discount
since you're a regular.

199
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:49,784
Do you have the Chanel tweed
from this year?

200
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:50,908
- The thick plaids?
- Yes.

201
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,987
We didn't get it in yet.

202
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,405
We'll get them next week.

203
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,814
But we have the Dior skirt.

204
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:58,910
It's really pretty. Look.

205
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,395
Isn't it pretty?

206
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,802
It's perfect for you.

207
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,585
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

208
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,436
- Ms. Lee!
- Yes, Na-rae.

209
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,621
Ms. Lee, I got in!

210
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:17,214
I got into Yale!

211
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,203
I just got the email today.

212
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,043
Really?

213
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll be your junior now!

214
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,325
Yes.

215
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,016
Great. Congratulations, Na-rae.

216
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,743
What do I do?

217
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:33,001
I'm so happy I can hardly breathe.

218
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,976
I'll visit the academy later with Mom.

219
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,575
Okay.

220
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:47,879
Yale?

221
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,972
This is the deal with essays.

222
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:53,684
More than writing your best,

223
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:57,662
a nonchalant essay
written by someone talented is more fun.

224
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:01,914
But if you try to add this and that
to copy them,

225
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,963
your writing will lose its direction.

226
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,210
You're trying too hard to be good,

227
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,284
and it makes your writing
distracting and ambiguous.

228
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,939
Ms. Lee, it's too hard.

229
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:13,044
You say it's boring when we try our best.

230
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,225
He's right.

231
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:16,327
Is it too hard?

232
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,895
It doesn't have to be fun.

233
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:23,007
What's important is to figure out
what you want to say.

234
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,390
As for your essay,
I only switched the order.

235
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,956
What do you think of it?
The message is stronger now.

236
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,509
Yes.

237
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,403
Ms. Lee,
can we go eat something after class?

238
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,571
Ms. Lee, please buy us pizza.

239
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,251
Pizza! Pizza!

240
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,227
I can't today. I have plans.

241
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,655
What plans?

242
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,941
Yes, where are you going?

243
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,159
BAEKMA TAILOR'S

244
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:52,103
TTANGJIB RESTAURANT

245
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:17,056
Hello! I'm here.

246
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,348
Mom!

247
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,450
You're here.

248
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,365
Sorry I'm so late.

249
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:24,005
Not at all. Was there traffic?

250
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:25,843
No. Are you well?

251
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,702
Mom, I'm here.

252
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,095
Hong-ju, Yu-mi is here. Yu-mi.

253
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,487
She can't hear well these days.
Her memory's fading too.

254
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:45,876
Mom. Mom.

255
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,839
Didn't you miss me?

256
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,572
It'll take her at least 30 minutes
to recognize you.

257
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,748
She'll keep asking herself
who you are for a while.

258
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,319
So they're turning this place
into a train station?

259
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:08,929
Yes. You know how we used to have
a way station?

260
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:13,047
They'll build
a proper one here instead.

261
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:17,631
Good thing
you didn't sell the store back then.

262
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:18,953
You're right.

263
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:22,558
I got your papers
from the union representative.

264
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:32,600
Did you think about what I suggested?

265
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,004
Yes.

266
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:40,170
I think it's best to take her
to a nursing home like you said.

267
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:42,768
Yes, good call.

268
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,318
A moment's distraction
can end up in big trouble.

269
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:48,993
I have a business to run too.

270
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:51,533
I'm sorry I can't take care of her.

271
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,754
No, don't say that.

272
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,384
You did more than enough.

273
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,640
The compensation will come out
a month after signing.

274
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:01,349
Some people got paid already.

275
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:03,918
With the money you get,

276
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,376
you'll be able to get yourself
a fine rental place in Seoul.

277
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,527
Don't you agree?

278
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,733
You're right.

279
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:14,137
You look radiant.

280
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,382
You look just like how you did
when you were in university.

281
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,554
Do you like it?

282
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,287
Yes.

283
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:32,250
Let's take this one too.

284
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,210
Why not? It's pretty.

285
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:00,660
Lee Yu-mi!

286
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,044
It's me, Bo-ra.

287
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,827
Who?

288
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,386
Jung Bo-ra.
We did ballet together in middle school.

289
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,233
Right! Yes, Bo-ra.

290
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:19,505
Geez. Do you remember me now?

291
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:22,848
Gosh, how do you look the same?
You didn't even age.

292
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,366
You're the same too.

293
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,799
That's impossible. I have three sons now.

294
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:30,049
Hello, Ma'am.

295
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:31,233
You got married?

296
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:33,563
Yes. This place is run by my in-laws.

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,533
You must have made it in Seoul.

298
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,650
I admire you.

299
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,894
No.

300
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:43,962
Don't lie. It says so on your face.

301
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,717
Enjoy the food.

302
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,986
Naengmyeon is on me.

303
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,331
Enjoy the food, Ma'am.

304
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:51,882
Thank you.

305
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,511
Good evening.

306
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:07,774
After all of us were given

307
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:13,551
8,760 hours in the 365 days of 2011,
it's finally coming to an end.

308
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:16,280
With YTN's special live programming,
The Past Year and the Coming Year,

309
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,503
we'll close off 2011 with our viewers

310
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:22,214
and welcome 2012 together.

311
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:25,455
You must take off your old clothes
to put on new ones.

312
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:28,032
Let's close our old accounts

313
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:32,052
and welcome a clean and new 2012.

314
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:33,403
JI-SOO: I HAD A HAPPY YEAR
TAKING YOUR CLASSES, MS. LEE

315
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,623
NA-RAE: MS. LEE,
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

316
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:54,137
You're early.

317
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:56,369
I just got here.

318
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,793
There's a drink I always get.

319
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,249
Do you want to try the same one?

320
00:20:02,712 --> 00:20:03,866
- Yes.
- Okay.

321
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:11,874
Were you surprised I called you
all of a sudden to meet up?

322
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,657
Yes, a little.

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,914
Where should I begin?

324
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,645
Our school has something called
Institute of Lifelong Education.

325
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,153
It's an institution for ordinary people.

326
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,037
Yes, I know.
Institute of Lifelong Education.

327
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,330
So you know about it.

328
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:35,964
We have a vacancy for an elective course.

329
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,949
It's not a difficult one.

330
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,585
I was suddenly reminded of you.

331
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,104
Me?

332
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,395
Ms. Park praised you so much,

333
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:53,032
and to be honest, I need more people
on my side at the school.

334
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,616
I'm afraid you think too highly of me.

335
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:05,229
How can such a beautiful person
be so modest?

336
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:07,730
They say it's conceit
if you're overly modest.

337
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,037
I know I had a bad reputation

338
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,960
while I was in the US.

339
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,565
Who cares about the past?
What's important is now.

340
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:23,477
Also, I'm not looking for someone
too talented.

341
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,093
Your family's well-off, right?

342
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:31,381
Pardon?

343
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:34,253
You're far from being worldly.

344
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:39,328
You might know,
but the position is highly sought after.

345
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,006
I mean it's not for free.

346
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:43,550
I see.

347
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,400
You know that this country
makes businesses based on school ties

348
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,399
and does politics
based on where you're from.

349
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,894
I'll give it a thought.

350
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:01,301
Aren't you teaching at an academy

351
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,652
because you don't have anyone to back you?

352
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:14,118
This one has the best view
out of the units this size.

353
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,291
You still get a view
of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

354
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:20,692
The units higher
than that building are too big.

355
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,013
This place is rarely leased. You're lucky.

356
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,253
Take your time to look around.

357
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,469
Why waste the degree
you went to America to get?

358
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,944
Being a part of "us"
creates a sense of belonging.

359
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:50,564
That social protection is useful.

360
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,301
We're from the same university after all.

361
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,893
Can I pay rent monthly instead?

362
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:10,428
It's rare to find a lease
that accepts yearly deposits,

363
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:12,179
so it'd be a waste...

364
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,019
I'll ask the landlord anyway.

365
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:19,565
Please wait a moment.

366
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,307
Hey, that's good news.

367
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,321
The job at the academy
was temporary anyway.

368
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:57,146
It's hard to become a lecturer
even with most degrees.

369
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,382
I'm worried since it's my first time.

370
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,181
I know you'll do well. Don't make a fuss.

371
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:10,846
I'm being dispatched to Shanghai.

372
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,190
To China?

373
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:16,553
China is a hot spot for news these days.

374
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,338
All our competitors are doing it,

375
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:20,216
so we have to do it too.

376
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,438
That's why they send people
like me who has no connections.

377
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:31,774
But they promised to make me
a political correspondent after.

378
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:42,993
Hey. Was there ever anything

379
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:44,942
you wanted to do but couldn't?

380
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:48,743
Me?

381
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,535
I ask because Ms. Park...
The academy director asked me.

382
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:56,246
Asked you what?

383
00:25:59,012 --> 00:26:01,006
I knew it already,

384
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:05,206
but she asked me if you're that rich.

385
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,060
I see.

386
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,533
We're not that rich.

387
00:26:14,643 --> 00:26:19,092
Actually, I've always been jealous of you.

388
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,712
You always wore nice things

389
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:24,477
and had nice bags too.

390
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:29,128
You just left the country to study
without worrying about money.

391
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:30,909
I envied that the most.

392
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:39,023
The faster you realize
you're not someone that great,

393
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,613
the easier it becomes to live.

394
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:45,613
But it's hard for me to admit.

395
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,857
I think people live the way they look.

396
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,863
The thing is, you're so nice.

397
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,396
Right, my key.

398
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:55,350
But...

399
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,007
Be careful.

400
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,624
This is the thing.

401
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:08,775
You're always so polite and nice
to everyone.

402
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:10,640
How can anyone be like that?

403
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,292
Don't you ever get angry?

404
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,338
Is there no anger in you? That's strange.

405
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:17,490
You said that five times already.

406
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,552
Five times or ten, it doesn't matter.

407
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:22,080
You should be writing notes down.

408
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,299
Come in, come in. I'm home!

409
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:25,847
Is someone home?

410
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:29,716
Come in, Yu-mi.

411
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,461
This is my room.

412
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,741
It changed, right?

413
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:40,042
Gosh, I'm so tired.

414
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:48,931
I really worked hard...

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,355
But,

416
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:56,675
I'm still paying off Dad's debt
from when he was cheated five years ago.

417
00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:59,484
Geez.

418
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:04,318
There's no guarantee

419
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:07,692
I'll be compensated
for the hard work that I do.

420
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,749
But if I slack off,

421
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,265
I'll definitely have to pay for it.

422
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:20,114
I have to stay on my toes all the time.

423
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:24,783
Hurry up and go to sleep.
You have work tomorrow.

424
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:28,271
You're right. I have work tomorrow.

425
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:30,951
I have work tomorrow.

426
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:36,265
Yu-mi, sleepover.

427
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,796
Okay? Sleep here.

428
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:05,959
We're always lacking art students
at our institution.

429
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,978
That's why I brought someone
young and beautiful to join us.

430
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,603
Please work hard with a sense of duty.

431
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:16,375
If you don't,
all of us will be in trouble next year.

432
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,365
Okay.

433
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:23,332
These days, older lecturers
are definitely not as popular.

434
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:28,637
I take the subway every now and then,
and I could feel it.

435
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,355
People hate old people.

436
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,303
They're busy,

437
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:36,476
so they think old people get in the way.

438
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,594
That's why you need to have
a social position when you're old.

439
00:29:40,677 --> 00:29:42,395
Professor, doctor, lawyer...

440
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,058
You'll see why these titles are important

441
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:46,496
when you get older.

442
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,554
Dean, you should just take your car.

443
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:51,675
Why did you take the subway?

444
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,972
If you want to be treated like a human
after you get old,

445
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:59,090
you either need money or honor.

446
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:03,599
That's why everyone in this country
is buying stocks and real estate.

447
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:05,943
But when you lecture at our institution,

448
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:09,016
you'll be called a professor.
It's not bad.

449
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,061
I see.

450
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:12,022
Here.

451
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,421
Hello.

452
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:40,014
I'll be lecturing on watching and
reading classics this semester.

453
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,706
I'm Lee Anna.

454
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:43,891
I look forward to teaching you.

455
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,020
HISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY ART

456
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:51,916
STUDY ON PAINTER KIM HONG-DO

457
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:55,419
CALLIGRAPHER KIM JEONG-HUI

458
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:57,049
KIM JEONG-HUI'S ART PHILOSOPHY

459
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,400
It's so pretty.

460
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll buy it later
when I go on a trip abroad.

461
00:31:27,838 --> 00:31:31,668
It'll be about the same price
at the duty-free if you pay tax.

462
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:33,546
You should buy it when you want it.

463
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,898
Next time.

464
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,519
Sorry I called you out to shop.

465
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:44,960
Could I buy it for you as a gift?

466
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:47,535
Really?

467
00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:51,279
Do you mean it?

468
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,088
Would you like this one?

469
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:56,535
Wait.

470
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,598
How about that one?

471
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:08,014
Could I get that one?

472
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:11,158
Excuse me.

473
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:14,918
Can you ring us up?

474
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,280
We'll take the big one over there.

475
00:32:18,363 --> 00:32:19,477
I'll pay in full right now.

476
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,900
I'll treat you to lunch.

477
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:30,218
Calligrapher Kim Jeong-hui
found it torturous

478
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:32,059
to look at works
that were below his standards.

479
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:35,012
He had a foul mouth
and always gave harsh criticism.

480
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:39,192
He found beautiful things very important.

481
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,793
When speaking ill of a work he disliked,

482
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,994
he'd describe it as a failure

483
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,098
or that it smelled like dirt.

484
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,771
By referencing dirt,
he meant that it looked too tacky.

485
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:57,596
We still use the word "failure"
a lot these days, right?

486
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,843
- Yes.
- Actually, he was the first to use

487
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,443
the word "failure" this way.

488
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,194
Hello. Hello.

489
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,842
Hey.

490
00:33:23,696 --> 00:33:25,065
Are you done for the day?

491
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:26,146
No.

492
00:33:26,229 --> 00:33:29,036
I have a critiquing class later.

493
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,495
We might need to increase
your class size next semester.

494
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:33,933
You're popular. Everyone knows now.

495
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:35,991
I'm sure that's not true.

496
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:40,294
I still have a long way to go
compared to the other professors.

497
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,494
Do you still sit in on classes?

498
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,193
Yes.

499
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:47,505
I'm not so confident in teaching
the new classes

500
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:50,254
like the critique class
and the theory class.

501
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,237
That's amazing.

502
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,541
Ms. Lee, don't your parents
push you to get married?

503
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,430
Well...

504
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:05,558
Maybe I could play matchmaker.

505
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:12,177
I'm not really ready...

506
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,360
He's a bit older,

507
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:17,414
but I'm sure you won't regret it.

508
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,333
You heard of IT Solid, right?

509
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,934
It's on the news often. IT Solid.

510
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:29,987
Their stock price went up
after receiving investment.

511
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,993
CHOI JI-HOON

512
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:34,842
The CEO is someone I know
from my hometown, Tongyeong.

513
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,895
He's looking for someone to marry.

514
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,636
CEO CHOI JI-HOON OF IT SOLID
SUPPORTS NURTURING TALENTS

515
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:00,394
Hello.

516
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:03,871
Nice to meet you.

517
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:11,039
I heard a lot about you
from Professor Kim.

518
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:17,499
I didn't know you were someone so famous
before he told me.

519
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,183
No, no...

520
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:26,927
I guess the media is getting
a bit interested in me these days.

521
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,766
I heard you're rushing to get married.

522
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,336
Yes. But I know

523
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:40,733
a marriage isn't something
one can rush into.

524
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:44,078
Actually,
I've been so busy with my company

525
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:46,924
that marriage never occurred to me.

526
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,237
But those arranged marriages
between companies

527
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,464
aren't something for me.

528
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:53,533
I see.

529
00:35:53,616 --> 00:35:57,499
I heard you studied art in America.

530
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,251
Yes.

531
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:05,637
When we constructed our company building,

532
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,919
this lounge where you're sitting now

533
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,583
is where I put in a lot of effort.

534
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:17,402
If you look around, all the objects

535
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:22,264
were picked by me one by one
through lots of legwork.

536
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,830
What do you think?

537
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:26,334
How is my taste?

538
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:31,909
Please evaluate it
from a professional's point of view.

539
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:33,931
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

540
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:35,008
I'm not sure.

541
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:40,040
You can't find your taste
or get a discerning eye instantly.

542
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:45,633
But once you get it,
it's hard to settle for less.

543
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:47,914
That's true.

544
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,925
Why are the chairs here

545
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,298
all imitations?

546
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,241
How did you know that?

547
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:10,899
I know

548
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,763
a little about furniture.

549
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,404
Gosh.

550
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,675
If I may be frank with you,

551
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:31,276
I'm not in a rush to get married.

552
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:34,834
Then...

553
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:40,059
Should we meet up just three times?

554
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,915
I'll follow your decision after that.

555
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:48,626
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,606
I wanted to buy you something,
but I figured you'd have everything.

557
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:02,204
Sorry it's something so small.

558
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,236
Not at all. I love perfumes.

559
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,192
It smells really good. Thank you.

560
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:10,865
Right.

561
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:21,928
This is something I bought from China.

562
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:23,564
It's a Tibetan Buddha statue,

563
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:27,269
and they say it's 2,000 years old.

564
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:28,900
What?

565
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,925
Do you want this?

566
00:38:35,642 --> 00:38:37,460
2,000 years old?

567
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,772
I'm not so familiar with antiques, but...

568
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:46,787
But?

569
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,674
But 2,000 years ago

570
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:54,377
was before Buddhism spread to Tibet.

571
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,232
What?

572
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,468
Hey. I'm not the only one who bought it.

573
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,144
All of my colleagues bought it.

574
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:09,888
Gosh, we were totally scammed.

575
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,378
This is why one must be educated.

576
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:15,433
You're so naive.

577
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:18,683
No. Usually,
I'm not interested in things like this.

578
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:21,971
But once I heard some Chinese,
I fell for it.

579
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,067
When I listen to them and look at it,

580
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,938
it sounds like it's true.

581
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,583
I should go sell it
to my department head tomorrow.

582
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,806
Right. Ji-won.

583
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:33,412
Yes?

584
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:39,084
Do you know Choi Ji-hoon of IT Solid?

585
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:41,742
Of course. He's famous.

586
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:45,138
A self-made man with leadership.

587
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,626
A successful case of a marketing strategy.

588
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:50,949
He was on a few shows last year
and his stock price went up.

589
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:53,304
Why do you ask?

590
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:56,203
Are you into stocks?

591
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,230
He's pretty outstanding,

592
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:06,565
but some people who struck rich
in IT can be dangerous.

593
00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,770
I'd hold off on deciding.

594
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,647
He was poor in the past.

595
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,078
Rumor says he's conscious
about his academic background.

596
00:40:15,737 --> 00:40:19,176
What was it called?
Institute of Lifelong Education?

597
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,613
He's taking
the top-level course or something.

598
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:26,409
- Good. Good.
- Too fast! Too fast!

599
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,771
Too fast!

600
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:28,912
You got it.

601
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:31,018
That's it, do a turn.

602
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:33,036
You got it. Come this way.

603
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,243
That way?

604
00:40:35,326 --> 00:40:36,417
That way?

605
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,985
Let's have a break with this.

606
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,635
It's so warm.

607
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:02,752
It's late. Why are you still up?

608
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,653
I woke up because of my dream.

609
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:09,133
Drink this and then go to bed.

610
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:13,646
Are you going somewhere again?

611
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:17,299
What do you mean?

612
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:21,497
You'll go to the US if I drink this.

613
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:27,045
No, I won't go.

614
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:33,649
I saw you in my dream earlier.

615
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,530
Dream? What dream?

616
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:43,743
I became a deer and I saw you from afar.

617
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:46,212
Yu-mi, why were you sad?

618
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,369
Was I sad?

619
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:56,230
Yes. You cried. You cried a lot.

620
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:06,635
Here.

621
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:20,680
The countdown has started.

622
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,443
I'm not going anywhere.

623
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,773
But Mom,

624
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:32,054
I'm getting married.

625
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,627
Now year 2015, the year of the blue sheep,

626
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,771
has begun.

627
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:43,091
We wish everyone a happy new year.
