1
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,750
I have no regrets

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,948
even if I die now.

3
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:42,764
My daughter is too meek,

4
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,926
so I figured that's why she was delayed
in getting married.

5
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,951
We had no idea she had someone.

6
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,694
We're thinking of holding a big wedding.

7
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:58,321
I learned a lot of things

8
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,521
as a councilman in Tongyeong.

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,411
How big were you thinking?

10
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:07,883
Please don't worry.
We'll take care of everything.

11
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:11,444
I'm thankful that both of you
are so considerate of me,

12
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,948
but of course, I should do something.

13
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,388
No, no.

14
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,626
Both of our families

15
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:22,573
would never shy away
from spending money on the wedding.

16
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,968
Yes. We can just spend and hire people.

17
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:31,247
Gosh. We don't know
what we should do in return.

18
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,578
I only have one thing I want.

19
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,444
Just a Benz gifted to me
by my daughter-in-law.

20
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:46,987
It's not because I want to ride it.

21
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,027
The truth and the fact

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,732
that she bought it for me is important.

23
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:53,830
Of course.

24
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,537
My dear son

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,185
ate only ramyeon
and sold his housing subscription account

26
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:03,923
to support me since he was 20.

27
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,729
He even saved our house
from being put up for auction.

28
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,495
Isn't that...

29
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,216
illegal?

30
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,865
You can't earn enough money
by following the law.

31
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,533
Becoming a self-made man

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,058
isn't as easy as it sounds.

33
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:37,432
Did you wait long?

34
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,680
It's okay.

35
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,907
Once the wedding's over,

36
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,729
my husband and I will drop you
at the airport.

37
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,755
In order for you to go through the gate,

38
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:56,880
you will need to fly somewhere like Japan
at the least.

39
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:01,050
What? Japan?

40
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:13,033
And for the wedding,

41
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,113
I would like to ask both of you

42
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,510
to pay more attention
to your clothes and hair.

43
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,915
Why? Are you not happy?

44
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:26,391
No.

45
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:32,599
When determining someone's
financial standing,

46
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,751
I look at their hair and shoes.

47
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:44,249
In all seriousness,

48
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:48,025
I declare that the couple is now married.

49
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:06,381
The recessional of the newlyweds
will now begin.

50
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:09,571
Groom and bride, march.

51
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,070
What an amazing wedding.

52
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,917
I know, right?
They won't accept any gifts either.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,547
How beautiful.

54
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,872
She was always beautiful.

55
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,677
Choi Ji-hoon used to be so tacky, though.

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,458
You are right.

57
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,788
He looked much older before,

58
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,437
but he turned out to be handsome.

59
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:20,579
By the way,
all of those people look like politicians.

60
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:23,690
- Where?
- Over there.

61
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,885
Rumor says he's interested in politics.
I guess it's true.

62
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:31,826
Really?

63
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,522
It's just a rumor.

64
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,596
She said her parents live in the US
because of their business.

65
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,385
They're really stylish for their age.

66
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,773
You can go.

67
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:53,036
Okay.

68
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:01,222
Hello, Ma'am. Hello, Sir. Congratulations.

69
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm Han Ji-won

70
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:06,220
who stayed in the same boarding house
as Yu-mi during university.

71
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,637
Who?

72
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,645
Anna. I'm Anna's university friend.

73
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,732
Really?

74
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,693
It's slippery out because of the snow.

75
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,502
Thank you for making your way here.

76
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:20,963
I heard a couple will live well
if it snows on their wedding day.

77
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,903
Do you want to link arms?

78
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,614
- Here we go.
- Okay.

79
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,883
One, two, three.

80
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:37,988
Both parents can go up.

81
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,179
Father.

82
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,013
Look at the camera.

83
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:50,891
One, two, three.

84
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,325
Just a minute.

85
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:56,251
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,164
Min-jae. Choi Min-jae.
Come here. Come on over.

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,739
Min-jae, let's take it together.

88
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,906
Who is he?

89
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:11,260
He's my cousin's son. Choi Min-jae.

90
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:13,496
Hello, Min-jae.

91
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,024
Hyacinth.

92
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,617
It originates
in the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey.

93
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,576
A flower that's planted in the fall.

94
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,528
- It has a scaly bulb...
- What did you say?

95
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,657
That's enough.

96
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,171
- Here we go.
- Look at the man.

97
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:27,672
Please stand up straight.

98
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,842
One, two, three.

99
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,350
My goodness.

100
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,724
Professor Lee.
The picture came out beautifully.

101
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:53,023
Please pack it back up
and put it in that room.

102
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,708
Why? Won't you hang it up?

103
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,388
It's not stylish to hang up
this kind of stuff at home.

104
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,485
I'm going out.

105
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,586
Okay.

106
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:07,817
See you later.

107
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,539
Basement level one.

108
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,579
The door's closing.

109
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,597
Hey.

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,043
Why didn't you come and see me earlier?

111
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,034
You're making me feel distant.

112
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:53,234
Come on, don't be like that.
This is why I can't visit you.

113
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,492
I stopped him
because I didn't want to bother you.

114
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,098
It's no bother at all.

115
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:03,499
The dean, your husband, and I
are all part of the family.

116
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:04,821
The Tongyeong family.

117
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,309
Yes, that's true.

118
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:11,694
Tongyeong is in Gyeongsang Province,
right?

119
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:16,440
I was born in Tongyeong,

120
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,061
but I was raised in Jangseong,
Jeolla Province.

121
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,384
I see.

122
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:25,471
It's an important call,
so I'll take it real quick.

123
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,173
- All right.
- Just a minute.

124
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:28,881
Hello.

125
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:29,976
Yes.

126
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:50,813
New Haven...

127
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:54,456
What was the name
of that famous pizza shop?

128
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,198
Are you talking about Frank Pepe?

129
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,586
Yes, Frank Pepe.

130
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:04,103
There was a park beside it too.

131
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,580
Yes, it's in front of Wooster Square.

132
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,085
I went there 20 years ago,

133
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,567
but I still can't forget that pizza place.

134
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:18,253
Yes. Memories made by food can be strong.

135
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,572
I already heard about you.

136
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,565
You're the one
keeping the institution in business.

137
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:34,106
You're too kind. It's not true.

138
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,785
Someone so talented shouldn't be there.

139
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,128
Thank you, brother.

140
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:43,974
I told you he has an eye for people.

141
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:50,710
Yes, Sir?

142
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,670
Hey. Tell the dean to come in.

143
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,287
- Right away, Sir.
- Good.

144
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,460
- Right.
- Yes.

145
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,737
- What about you?
- Yes.

146
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,649
What happened to the nomination?

147
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,675
It's not easy.

148
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,953
I'm a newcomer with no connections,

149
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,558
so it's hard.

150
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,497
Yes. That party is a bit difficult.

151
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,497
They can't accept changes.

152
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,008
They're condescending old people.

153
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:20,280
When you look at these people,

154
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:24,201
they may seem like they're stupid
with their vulgar language,

155
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,583
but they're actually super fast
at catching on.

156
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,425
They're quick thinkers.

157
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,488
They're just putting up a show.

158
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:35,858
They talk vulgarly on purpose.

159
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,562
I only realized after going there.

160
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,150
It must be tough on you.

161
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,369
It's okay.

162
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:46,108
I must fight through the hardships.

163
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:55,701
Now, she's an alumna
who is here for the first time.

164
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,253
It's Lee Anna.

165
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,424
The legendary Lee Anna?

166
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,689
Why did she suddenly show up?

167
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,136
Not many people will have
good things to say.

168
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,304
Don't be like that.

169
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:27,424
It'd be good to know each other.

170
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,629
Are you close with her?

171
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:32,858
Yes, we have known each other
for some time.

172
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:35,165
She's beautiful like the rumor says.

173
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,124
Right?

174
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,911
You can't study with that face.
You have to party.

175
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:44,903
I heard a lot about you
from Professor Yoon.

176
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,451
- Why didn't you come before?
- Right.

177
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:09,037
Hello.

178
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,332
I'm your professor
for Asian Art History this semester.

179
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:13,875
I'm Lee Anna.

180
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,400
It's my first time
teaching an undergraduate course,

181
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,880
so I'm really nervous.

182
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:21,672
I look forward to the semester.

183
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,051
This is tuna belly from Spain.

184
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:31,079
Okay.

185
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:34,130
My husband?
He's too busy, so I hardly see him.

186
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:39,065
I don't know much,
but it must not be going well.

187
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,617
Sure.

188
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,191
There are so many variables
when it comes to politics.

189
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,676
It's a tiring job.

190
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,315
I think he's a bit obsessed.

191
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:51,765
I know.

192
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,578
Your husband has a strong desire
to get recognized.

193
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:59,508
But this is the thing with people.

194
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,949
If they have a lot of money,

195
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,745
they want to become famous.

196
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:07,459
People around him encourage him,

197
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:09,706
then he gets pumped up.

198
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,075
But once he gets there,
the reaction is lukewarm.

199
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:15,361
It's always like this.

200
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,342
It's hard.

201
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,712
To be honest,

202
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,612
I don't want him to be in politics.

203
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:30,187
I don't want my personal life
to become public.

204
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,090
Of course not. It's uncomfortable.

205
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:39,849
He'll give up soon, right?

206
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,351
Your dessert is Kyoto matcha ice cream.

207
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,532
Wow.

208
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,712
640,000 WON

209
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,995
Wow. It's 300,000 won a meal.

210
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,129
I feel bad since it's so expensive.

211
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,325
Come on.
You'll make me upset if you say that.

212
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,437
Hey.

213
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,276
What's the best thing about being rich?

214
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,427
Be honest.

215
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:19,084
Not having to ask people for favors.

216
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,123
Right.

217
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,398
That's true.

218
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,771
I agree

219
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,992
because I always have
to ask everyone for favors.

220
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:32,315
Every single day.

221
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,051
Today was like that too.

222
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,367
It's delicious.

223
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,901
We've expanded the scope.

224
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:45,241
It brings me much joy
to be able to give opportunities

225
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,455
to students with disabilities now.

226
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:49,960
I will always support
your dreams and hopes,

227
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:54,001
and I will continue
to be with you in the future.

228
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:57,221
Congratulations on your scholarship.

229
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:01,051
SCHOLARSHIP PRESENTATION CEREMONY

230
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:05,310
That was a congratulatory message
from CEO Choi of IT Solid, our sponsor.

231
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:06,959
- Next up...
- Sir.

232
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,351
Our sign language interpreter
misunderstood the time.

233
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,105
They're on their way now, but...

234
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,759
Why didn't you prepare properly?

235
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:17,943
What about the kid's mom?

236
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:21,005
She stepped out,
and she won't pick up her phone.

237
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,754
Should we switch the order?

238
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:26,172
Yes. We can move this to later instead.

239
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:28,093
Excuse me.

240
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,589
Do you need someone
to interpret sign language?

241
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,003
Yes. She's deaf-mute.
Can you do sign language?

242
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:38,145
This way.

243
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:52,385
There was a miscommunication.
You must be startled.

244
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,381
I think we can go ahead.

245
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:58,506
Okay.

246
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:04,830
Next is a valedictory speech
from scholar Lee Jin-young.

247
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,635
It's okay.

248
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:27,203
Even if you make a mistake,
I'll be the only one who notices.

249
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,585
Watch this.

250
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:36,853
You're all stupid for not knowing
sign language.

251
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:38,390
Dummies.

252
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:07,402
"I am Lee Jin-young, and I was selected

253
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,437
to receive the scholarship
as a gifted art student."

254
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:14,135
"I can't hear or talk,
but when I'm drawing,

255
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,725
I can communicate with everything

256
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,894
in the world."

257
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:28,162
"Thank you so much
for giving me the opportunity

258
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,434
to follow my dreams."

259
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:07,345
Democratic Republican Party's
Choi Ji-hoon is gaining attention

260
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,499
His internal rating has been low,

261
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,736
but the public finds him favorable
and is extremely popular.

262
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:18,304
We suspect the competition will be fierce.

263
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:25,686
Twenty-third floor.

264
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,070
The door's closing.

265
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:30,991
Going up.

266
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,650
First floor. The door's opening.

267
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,015
It's here.

268
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,430
Twenty-fourth floor.

269
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,893
The door's closing.

270
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:51,948
Going up.

271
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,977
Wait.

272
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:17,216
Is that you, Yu-mi?

273
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,233
It is you.

274
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,001
Long time no see.

275
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,822
Do you work here?

276
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,929
Twenty-third floor.

277
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,621
The door's opening.

278
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,414
Aren't you getting off?

279
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:58,983
See you later.

280
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,786
The door's closing.

281
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,606
Twenty-fourth floor.

282
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,220
The door's opening.

283
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,741
KANG JAE-HO

284
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:38,531
Hello, I'm reporter Han Ji-won
from Korea Daily.

285
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,359
What? Hey, Jae-ho.

286
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,348
It's me, Ji-won. Han Ji-won.

287
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:49,899
Oh, right.

288
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,916
- The editor of Ehyeon's magazine?
- Yes.

289
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:55,633
It's nice to see you. Sit down.

290
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:57,047
- Are you well?
- Yes.

291
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,983
I'm filling in for someone last minute,

292
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,958
so I didn't know I was meeting you.

293
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,845
- Really?
- I better give you my name card.

294
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:10,083
So you ended up
becoming a reporter after all.

295
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,478
You really made it.

296
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:17,102
I still have a long way to go.

297
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:20,375
It was better when I was a developer.
Managing a business is hard.

298
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,512
Being modest doesn't suit you.

299
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,788
You need to be honest in an interview.

300
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,579
You're exactly the same.

301
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:34,051
You had such a strong will,
so I knew you'd become a reporter.

302
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,399
Did you stay in the States all this time?

303
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:39,878
Yes.
Well, I had to since my business is there.

304
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:43,388
I only make a short visit to Korea
when I'm traveling to Japan.

305
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:47,780
What a small world we live in.
We ended up meeting again.

306
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:49,238
You're right.

307
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,947
Do you still talk to everyone?

308
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,434
Yes, a few.

309
00:22:55,885 --> 00:23:00,705
While bringing up my company,
I had to think a lot and make decisions.

310
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,011
Seoul is the world's
seventh largest megalopolis.

311
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,708
Dear people of Seoul

312
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,360
and party members.

313
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:13,531
What we need is someone

314
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:16,639
who thinks about competitiveness
and what drives us to grow.

315
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:21,363
I'm young,
and my leadership is innovative.

316
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:24,639
Please support Choi Ji-hoon.

317
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:25,726
Thank you!

318
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:27,926
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
FIFTH PARTY CONVENTION

319
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,014
THE BIRTH OF A NEW KIND OF RULING

320
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,526
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

321
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:44,739
By the way,
when did you learn sign language?

322
00:23:44,822 --> 00:23:46,996
I was so impressed
while watching the video online.

323
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,953
Countless people pressed like
on that video.

324
00:23:51,511 --> 00:23:56,548
You two are like Jacqueline
and President Kennedy.

325
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,416
You're just like them.

326
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,667
Please don't say something like that.

327
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,041
It might start weird news reports.

328
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:06,601
Many things come into play,

329
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:09,129
but the candidate himself
is what determines the election result.

330
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:12,945
Yes. I'm trying not to think about it
in a complicated way.

331
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:15,541
I have a concrete and clear goal,

332
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:16,654
and that's what I'm enjoying.

333
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:18,934
Yes, that's true. But I think

334
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:23,679
your wife's support
really gave you a boost.

335
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,507
If you have a beautiful flower,

336
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,381
you should take it around
and show everyone.

337
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:29,429
That's true.

338
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,351
Shall we have a drink?

339
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,671
Anyway, just get elected
and it'll be smooth sailing.

340
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:36,928
Of course.

341
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,783
Let's remember

342
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,254
these members!

343
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:58,006
Hey! Yu-mi!

344
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:05,374
Did you win the lottery or something?

345
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:22,863
Basement level one. The door's opening.

346
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,405
SUN-WOO FROM MARAIS

347
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:50,733
Hey, Sun-woo.

348
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,561
It's me. Long time no talk.

349
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:54,615
Hey, Yu-mi.

350
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:57,088
Are you well?

351
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,663
No, I'm not doing well.

352
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:01,486
I think
Marais will go out of business soon.

353
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,767
Why?

354
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,179
You don't know yet, do you?

355
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:11,089
Mr. Lee passed away last year
due to a stroke.

356
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:12,223
I see.

357
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,163
Little Director came back to Korea
last month to get a divorce.

358
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,956
But she owes her husband money
because of stocks.

359
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:24,055
The family already sold
two buildings last year.

360
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:28,816
You know, Little Director
never had a worry in her life before.

361
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,755
These days, she's scarier than Mr. Lee
whenever someone mentions money.

362
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:33,291
She just screams her head off.

363
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,826
Ms. Kim was the first to quit.

364
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,410
Is she planning to stay here?

365
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:44,367
She said she'll go back, but I'm not sure.

366
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,421
I heard she started
a fashion business there with a celebrity.

367
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:53,788
Professor Lee.

368
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,294
It's past 7:00 p.m.
Aren't you going home?

369
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:59,726
You must have a lot on your mind.

370
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:01,356
I'll head out first.

371
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:03,525
Okay.

372
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,108
Wow, it smells good.

373
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,709
Why did you come unannounced?

374
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:20,403
I could've ordered some in advance
if you did.

375
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:25,364
I suddenly remembered
that you have Wednesdays off.

376
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:27,640
This is delicious.

377
00:27:27,723 --> 00:27:29,926
It's even better
since I didn't expect to eat this.

378
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,224
Ji-won.

379
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:35,294
Yes?

380
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:40,975
Why do you want to become
a political journalist?

381
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,974
I'm not sure. Well...

382
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:51,180
I kind of feel a sense of duty.

383
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:56,328
These people always talk about
beliefs and justice,

384
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,661
but in actuality, they get together

385
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:04,438
to rig everything and lie.

386
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:07,670
And when these people get caught,

387
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,124
they're never sorry.

388
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:15,516
Someone needs to teach them a lesson.
Don't you agree?

389
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:24,653
They promised to make me
a political correspondent after China,

390
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,667
but they keep delaying it.

391
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,939
I knew it.
It's exactly like what happens in movies.

392
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,287
What?

393
00:28:32,596 --> 00:28:35,107
"After this job,
you'll be free to leave the gang."

394
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,895
"This is the last job."

395
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:37,933
You know what I mean, right?

396
00:28:39,658 --> 00:28:43,096
But no one ever keeps their promise
in these movies.

397
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,736
Yet I fell for it too.

398
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:58,979
Yu-mi, did something happen?

399
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:00,484
You're not yourself today.

400
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:04,943
No, I'm okay.

401
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:09,832
I'm just tired.

402
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:13,839
What? What is it?

403
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,441
Ji-won, do you know this?

404
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:27,400
They say autumn is the season for reading,

405
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:32,121
but it started as a marketing strategy
because it used to be a low sales season.

406
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,552
Seriously?

407
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,218
I see.

408
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:40,680
They say you'll live well
if you move on a rainy day

409
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:46,035
because it's really tiring to move
when it rains.

410
00:29:47,192 --> 00:29:48,997
They made up the saying to encourage you.

411
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,403
Sayings like "No pain, no gain" too.

412
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,506
When people realize
these sayings are fake,

413
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,273
they won't live to their fullest.

414
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,170
Don't pick up.

415
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,273
Why not?

416
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,253
It's probably someone
complaining about the noise.

417
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,503
It's late. Do it later.

418
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,205
It only takes 2 or 3 minutes.
Why are people so impatient?

419
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,702
Geez.

420
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,224
Can we move?

421
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,380
Why all of a sudden?

422
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,918
I want to live where I can
open the windows all the way.

423
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,742
All high-rises are like this.

424
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,789
It's suffocating.

425
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:47,518
But everyone's jealous of our place
even when the windows don't open.

426
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:51,010
We're like a symbol that tells them,

427
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,185
they can become like us if they work hard.

428
00:31:56,668 --> 00:32:00,143
People will say it's too extravagant
during the election campaign.

429
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,527
I said, I bought this place
so people would talk about it.

430
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:19,935
I met with Ji-won.

431
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:21,012
Okay.

432
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:26,708
Korea Daily?
That company doesn't seem so good.

433
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:28,300
I see.

434
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:31,390
Is there a position you can make for her?

435
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:32,644
At a political desk.

436
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:38,955
That would be no problem at all.

437
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,819
People won't talk bad about you
even if you get her a position.

438
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:47,401
She's smart and is a person of principles.

439
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:52,288
Okay.

440
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:56,671
But I have a condition.

441
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:01,496
You should try to get along
with the wives of the assemblymen.

442
00:33:07,093 --> 00:33:08,833
I can't get along with them.

443
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,393
Just humor them.

444
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:16,289
You should be at the center
of all social gatherings.

445
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:19,640
The real information will come out
from the mouths of those women.

446
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,528
Fine. But please smoke outside.

447
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:37,130
Is Bokuk Daily's Director Kim in Korea?

448
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,712
Hello?

449
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:58,648
Are you Korea Daily's Han Ji-won?

450
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:00,097
Yes, this is she.

451
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:03,906
I'm calling from Bokuk Daily's HR team.

452
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,655
Okay. And?

453
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:07,824
If you're free,

454
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:11,473
I can go near Korea Daily's office
in about two hours.

455
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:12,895
Shall we meet for a moment?

456
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,862
I can, but what is this about?

457
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:20,223
To offer you a position.

458
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:21,293
Pardon?

459
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:24,791
Okay, Assemblyman Min.

460
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:26,997
What is it that you want to do now?

461
00:34:30,316 --> 00:34:32,457
You should take responsibility
for what you said.

462
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,833
You can't take your word back now.

463
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:41,807
So a verbal promise isn't a promise?

464
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,929
Twenty-third floor. The door's opening.

465
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,894
She was trying to fix it by herself...

466
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:58,255
Hyun-joo might seem old enough...

467
00:34:58,338 --> 00:34:59,452
Yes.

468
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:02,369
But she knows nothing about the world.

469
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:04,315
The door's closing.

470
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:05,671
Exactly.

471
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:09,434
Do you know how much debt
that hospital has?

472
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:11,230
It's crazy.

473
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:12,485
Yes.

474
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:16,166
If he took care of things well,

475
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,277
she wouldn't have invested in stocks.

476
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,913
Basement level one.

477
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,645
The door's opening.

478
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:29,181
We'll just give them the money as soon as
the building sells to finish it off.

479
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,352
It'll really ruin her at this rate.

480
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:34,694
Yes. Right now?

481
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:37,904
I came to feed Hyun-joo's dog,
and now I'm on my way to the lawyer.

482
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:39,763
All I have is my daughter.

483
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,408
There's nothing I can't do for her.

484
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,506
What's your job?

485
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:11,524
I'm sorry, Sir.

486
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:16,278
I messaged you to ask you
to come down after ten minutes.

487
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:17,589
I guess you didn't see it.

488
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,308
You messaged me?

489
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,995
Did you say you messaged me?

490
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:27,213
I left home early,

491
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:29,717
but there was an accident
on Inner Ring Expressway.

492
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,917
The exits are few and far between there.

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,038
I'm so sorry.

494
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,162
It's basic to be on time.

495
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:37,719
Also, look at the car.

496
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,480
I got a car wash yesterday,

497
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,849
but it rained overnight.

498
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:47,433
I couldn't look after it today.

499
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:48,615
I'm so sorry.

500
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:52,211
You never tried preparing in advance,
have you?

501
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,716
Today was an exception.

502
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:55,170
I'll get things right next time, sir.

503
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:56,951
Why always next time?

504
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,226
Do you know what's common
among people like you?

505
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,058
You're lazy,

506
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:13,656
impatient,

507
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,289
and full of excuses.

508
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,426
Honey!

509
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,611
Mr. Kim, wake up.

510
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,603
How will you make a living like this?

511
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:34,737
You can't survive in this harsh world
like this.

512
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,705
Please stop.

513
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,846
Stop!

514
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,450
Step aside.

515
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,744
Go over there and stay out.

516
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:47,377
Keep your mouth shut.

517
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,162
Do you feel wronged?

518
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:06,780
After all,

519
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:10,462
you did send a text.

520
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:16,069
You did your best. You did all you could.

521
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:19,317
What could be the problem?

522
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,594
Geez.

523
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:29,721
Hey.

524
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:34,825
I'm sorry, Sir.

525
00:38:34,908 --> 00:38:37,225
This won't ever happen again.

526
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:38,778
It was nice having you.

527
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:45,470
- What a morning.
- Sir.

528
00:38:46,196 --> 00:38:49,137
Sir, I'll fix my mistake.

529
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,176
Sir.

530
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:52,135
Sir.

531

KOREA DAILY

532
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:12,892
Aren't you going to eat?

533
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,260
No. I'll eat later.

534
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,622
Enjoy your lunch.

535
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:26,494
Living expenses...

536
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,044
When did it ever go down?

537
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,443
Sure.

538
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:37,404
This is a huge exclusive

539
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:41,015
only Han Ji-won can write about.

540
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:43,656
BOKUK DAILY, LEE YOON-GEOL

541
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:45,614
Sir!

542
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:49,581
If Bokuk Daily is scouting me,
should I go or not?

543
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,421
Are you stupid? Of course, you should.

544
00:39:58,089 --> 00:39:59,093
Ta-da.

545
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:02,198
What is this?

546
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:09,076
You mentioned you used to like
the Crazy Donut in front of our school.

547
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:12,508
Right.

548
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,151
Did I say that?

549
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:17,128
I was reminded of you,

550
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:19,668
so I went there in a hurry
just before going to the airport.

551
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,988
Are you proud of me?

552
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:25,446
Yes. Thank you.

553
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:26,938
It didn't even cross my mind.

554
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,428
Ms. Lee, I heard you're a professor now.

555
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,308
Congratulations.

556
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:38,607
You know how Professor Joseph
always says the same thing in class?

557
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:42,263
The Law of Jante.

558
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:44,897
The sentiment
is completely different from Korea.

559
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,041
Thanks to him,

560
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:49,713
I want to go to a graduate school
in northern Europe.

561
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:54,800
It's so unfamiliar to me and exotic...

562
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,541
...criticized Francoist dictatorship

563
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:11,622
and showed Leftist tendencies...

564
00:42:24,337 --> 00:42:26,163
One, two, three.

565
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,206
JOINT SPEECH SESSION
FOR SEOUL METROPOLITAN AREA

566
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,747
He said he drew just as well

567
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,472
as Raphael when he was 12.

568
00:44:10,388 --> 00:44:11,480
Lee Yu-mi.

569
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:17,253
I think you owe me an explanation.

570
