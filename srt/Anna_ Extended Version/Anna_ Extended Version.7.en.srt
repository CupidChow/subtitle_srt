1
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,913
JINMI GIMBAP

2
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,735
CLOSED

3
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:59,471
Mom, I'm home.

4
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,317
What?

5
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,751
Were you discharged?

6
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,882
What is this? Didn't you know?

7
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,406
Has it been that long already?

8
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,222
Did you close the restaurant?

9
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:20,680
Yes.

10
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:21,665
Why?

11
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:27,421
Where's Mom?

12
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:34,462
Are you sick?

13
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,279
Are you home, Ji-hoon?

14
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,829
We had to close the restaurant
since I'm not well.

15
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:51,016
You should go to the hospital
if you're sick. What are you doing?

16
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:53,974
Is it fatigue?

17
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:56,787
Did you eat?

18
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,125
What are you doing? Let's go.

19
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:03,987
No, it's okay.

20
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,027
What is it?

21
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,657
It's not that...

22
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,956
Her illness is too severe.

23
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,224
Hurry up and get on.

24
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:18,831
I told you, it's okay.

25
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,383
It's too late to get that treatment

26
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,115
called chemotherapy,

27
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:27,986
and it's been over a year

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,813
since we couldn't pay
for our health insurance.

29
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,668
What?

30
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:38,818
Is it cancer?

31
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,379
She's taking some medication for it.

32
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,506
Were you just waiting around
for the day she dies?

33
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,470
What have you done?

34
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,269
What did you do after you closed the shop?

35
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,877
I bet you just sat there,
smoking and drinking.

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,397
You were probably running tedious errands
for the city council with Mr. Kim.

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,651
What is it?
Do you no longer have connections?

38
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,609
Am I right?

39
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,338
What about the rent?

40
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:40,673
Your daughter died from being hit by a car
and you wasted away the settlement money.

41
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,346
Now it's Mom.

42
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,826
How can you call yourself a human?

43
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,123
Darn it.

44
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:20,417
OH MYUNG-HOON

45
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,099
Myung-hoon!

46
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:44,697
It's me, Ji-hoon.

47
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:48,171
Yes, I got home.

48
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,649
Really?

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,743
Yeah?

50
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:01,981
I called to ask you for a favor.

51
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,286
Can you lend me some money?

52
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,520
About 10 million won.

53
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,373
Busan?

54
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,917
I'll repay you. You know I will, right?

55
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,294
What do you need it for?

56
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:36,603
When I got home,

57
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,864
I found out my mom is sick.

58
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,421
It's cancer.

59
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:44,717
Really?

60
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,724
Are you sure that's enough?

61
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:52,598
I'll pay insurance with this for now,
so I can admit her to a hospital.

62
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,703
- Then I'll earn some money.
- What will you do?

63
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:58,496
Do you know the shipyard in Tongyeong?

64
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,472
- Yes.
- I'm going to go there.

65
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,160
Really?

66
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:09,198
Hey. Why don't you work with us?

67
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,187
You know how my family builds apartments.

68
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,692
I know. Myungjin Construction.

69
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,278
You can sell apartments and shops.

70
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,861
What do I have to do?

71
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,084
Will it make good money?

72
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,576
Yes.

73
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:27,715
ten years from now,

74
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:33,658
the real estate market in Busan
will be on fire from Haeundae on out.

75
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,657
We butter up the politicians

76
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,433
to loosen the regulations first,

77
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:43,037
then we build up fast and sell them.

78
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,295
But the risk is too big.

79
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,588
Do you have any idea how much money

80
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,672
my dad takes to the Busan mayor
every year?

81
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:59,797
The thing is,
it's not illegal if you don't get caught.

82
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,565
That's how it is in this field.

83
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,918
What about school? Are you not going back?

84
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,309
I won't go back to school.

85
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:17,558
I just decided on

86
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,133
my life goal.

87
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,793
Mom died without getting a chance
to fight off her illness.

88
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,508
How could you sleep?

89
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:51,811
If you're incompetent,

90
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,740
you should just die.

91
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,551
I'm capable
of leading this administration!

92
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,374
I, Choi Ji-hoon,

93
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,669
will not say empty words about the future.

94
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:17,596
I, Choi Ji-hoon,

95
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:22,372
am confident that I'll be innovative
in practicing conservative values.

96
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:26,648
CENTER OF CAPABILITY,
INNOVATIVE SEOUL'S CHOI JI-HOON

97
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,846
Dear admirable Seoul citizens.

98
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:30,578
Please join forces.

99
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,099
Let's win the general election

100
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,843
and stay in power.

101
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,551
I, Choi Ji-hoon, will make that happen!

102
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:48,064
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

103
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,380
Ms. Yoon So-jung,
you attended the same school as Lee Anna

104
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:57,877
and you're also a Korean,

105
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,075
so I wonder if you know anything
about her recent news.

106
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,780
Are you talking about Hyun-joo?

107
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:04,854
"Hyun-joo"?

108
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:08,364
She has two names.

109
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,860
Her Korean name is Hyun-joo,
and here, she's called Anna.

110
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:11,971
LEE ANNA EQUALS HYUN-JOO

111
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:14,742
She lived in Boston until last year,

112
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:17,209
but I heard she went back to Korea
to get a divorce.

113
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:19,655
I don't know what happened after.

114
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:21,976
I only hear about her
through other people.

115
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,042
Do you happen to know
where she's staying in Korea?

116
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,274
Reporter,

117
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:31,766
did you call me
because a ghostwriter wrote her thesis?

118
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:35,912
"A ghostwriter"?

119
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:39,882
I was hoping it would be made public.

120
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,792
She bought her graduation thesis
with money.

121
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,484
When it comes
to calligrapher Kim Jeong-hui,

122
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:52,795
this piece is often brought up
for expressing the life of Joseon scholars

123
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,835
who enjoy the dignified way of living
despite being poor.

124
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,149
His writing lists

125
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,053
what side dishes are the best,

126
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:02,129
which are tofu, cucumber,
ginger, and herbs.

127
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:03,321
Do they sound dignified?

128
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:04,528
Yes.

129
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:09,815
But considering the situation at the time,
it's not really agreeable.

130
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,945
You know how much effort it takes

131
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,409
to make tofu, right?

132
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,401
Tofu?

133
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,529
Yes.

134
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,113
If you want to eat tofu for breakfast,

135
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,894
you must wake up at 3:00 a.m.
even at the present time.

136
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:30,835
Also, cucumber has a weak taste
and has very little calories.

137
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,809
It was extravagant to eat such a vegetable

138
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,753
during the Joseon Dynasty.

139
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,873
Yes?

140
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,425
Professor Lee.

141
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,610
Yes?

142
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:47,984
I'm so upset.

143
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:49,698
About what?

144
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,545
The dean just informed me

145
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,114
that you'll be taking a break
because of the election.

146
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,531
It's rare that someone does this
in the middle of a semester,

147
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:01,033
but I was told to help you exit smoothly.

148
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:03,474
APPLICATION FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE

149
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:05,682
You just have to sign here.

150
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:16,907
LEE ANNA

151
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,096
Here.

152
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:24,580
You'll return after the election, right?

153
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:27,735
Yes.

154
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,085
"Closed for business".

155
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,206
Why?

156
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,986
- What are you doing?
- What?

157
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,235
I'm here to see someone.

158
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,323
Who?

159
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,033
The owner of this place.

160
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:22,578
That's right. The owner.

161
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,464
What is it? Did I do something wrong?

162
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,978
The whole neighborhood is sensitive
these days.

163
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,365
They'll report anyone
they're not familiar with.

164
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,768
What? I was reported?

165
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,211
You don't seem to have a clue,
so you're probably not someone close.

166
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,231
You should just go.
You won't be able to see them anyway.

167
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,050
Let's go.

168
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,109
Wait!

169
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,288
I'm a reporter from Bokuk Daily.
Just a minute.

170
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:50,077
Isn't it hard to travel here for work
all the way from Incheon?

171
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,020
A little.

172
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,549
Smile a little.

173
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:58,910
It's nice when you smile.

174
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:01,846
Gosh, it's Professor Lee.

175
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,031
Hello.

176
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,029
- Please have a lot.
- Okay.

177
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:06,652
Thank you.

178
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,126
I'll get you a studio apartment nearby.

179
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,481
Pardon?

180
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,984
You're working for me now.

181
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,474
Consider it your welfare.

182
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,150
You don't have to do that.

183
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,614
It's not a lot of money to me.

184
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,381
I'm really okay.

185
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,568
It makes me uncomfortable.

186
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:35,976
Okay.

187
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,045
Do you remember Mr. Kim

188
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:50,068
who used to drive for my husband?

189
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,908
Yes. I know Mr. Kim.

190
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,563
I think he changed his number.

191
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:00,308
Can you look into his address?

192
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:04,037
Okay. His address?

193
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:12,088
I don't want anyone to know
what I ask you to do.

194
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,566
Okay. I'll mark your words.

195
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:22,564
Also, many people got fired

196
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,832
just for getting on Ji-hoon's bad side.

197
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,628
Can you put together
a list of their names?

198
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,483
Ms. Cho.

199
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:38,455
Yes?

200
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,570
Can I trust you?

201
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:44,466
Yes.

202
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:48,281
Thank you.

203
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:50,191
Please enjoy the meal.

204
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:51,254
Okay.

205
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:07,893
Public Prosecutor General Lee Seung-moo
and Busan Mayor Oh Myung-hoon are here.

206
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:09,407
How exhausting.

207
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,284
Sergeant Choi,
this place has such tight security.

208
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,918
Why did you book a place so high up?

209
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,051
This is my pal from the Marine Corps,
Choi Ji-hoon.

210
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,028
Hello, Sir. I'm Choi Ji-hoon.

211
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:22,230
I heard a lot about you.

212
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:25,170
We always said we would meet,
and we finally made it today.

213
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:26,218
Gosh.

214
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,383
What are you doing? Sit down.
It's so dizzying since we're so high up.

215
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:34,348
I thought I should win the election first

216
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,194
before even requesting
to meet someone big like you.

217
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,214
He's a sensible guy.

218
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:44,351
Of course I wouldn't invite just anyone
to meet you.

219
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,518
The "Hoon" in our names means the same.

220
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,103
It means "to teach".

221
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:52,302
He's from Tongyeong too.
We're both from the same hometown,

222
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,045
and we're practically brothers.

223
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,502
You know Prosecutor General Lee
is from Gimhae, right?

224
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:58,692
Of course.

225
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:01,385
Sir, please let me pour you a drink.

226
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:02,671
Wait.

227
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,109
- Pass it over.
- Why?

228
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:06,133
The big brother should pour you one first.

229
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,701
- Why not?
- Really?

230
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:09,963
Have a drink.

231
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:11,797
It's an honor.

232
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,511
I'll pour you one.

233
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,470
Thank you, Myung-hoon.

234
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:20,567
That's enough.

235
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:57,675
Yes.

236
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,338
Yes.

237
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:08,249
We had a natural burial yesterday.

238
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,522
In Gapyeong.

239
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:24,362
Stella doesn't know much Korean.

240
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,202
No, she doesn't know...

241
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,076
that her mom is gone.

242
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,162
Yes.

243
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,958
All that happened
the day before Stella's birthday.

244
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:44,027
I'll call another time.

245
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:48,177
Basement level one. The door's opening.

246
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:52,740
Come on, Stella.

247
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:09,561
The door's closing.

248
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:42,229
Hello.

249
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:46,094
Are you Reporter Hwang's junior?

250
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,481
Yes, I'm Han Ji-won. Coffee?

251
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,862
Yes, thank you.

252
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,653
Reporter Hwang told me to go see you

253
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:54,121
if it's something under
Jongno Police Station's jurisdiction.

254
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:56,730
What are you curious about?

255
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:58,696
Well,

256
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,476
it's about the suicide
in Pyeongchang-dong.

257
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,882
That case?

258
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:08,663
There's nothing to it.

259
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,547
Did the deceased named Lee Hyun-joo
really commit suicide?

260
00:19:12,302 --> 00:19:15,330
It would be stranger if it wasn't suicide.
All circumstances point to it.

261
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,967
She had stock investment debt
and was getting a divorce,

262
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,071
and she had to pay alimony.
She was unlikely to get child custody too.

263
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:25,527
She was drinking a lot,
and frequented the casino.

264
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,829
She wasn't someone ordinary.

265
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,756
But there is no will.

266
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:35,910
Well,

267
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:41,080
when people commit suicide after drinking,
it's usually unplanned.

268
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:44,355
They do it impulsively
after getting drunk.

269
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:45,514
I see.

270
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,651
Her mother told us

271
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:51,620
that she suffered from bipolar disorder
after giving birth in the US.

272
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:52,840
"Bipolar disorder"?

273
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:56,784
Her family reacted
as if it wasn't a surprise.

274
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:11,129
In the next few days,

275
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,884
you should receive some kind of pot
from a private museum.

276
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:19,705
Don't have someone else take it.

277
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,710
Deliver it to Minister Park yourself.

278
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:26,063
Is it Star Jar?

279
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,892
It's so tiny, but super expensive.

280
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,746
Not "Star".

281
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,433
You must mean "Moon".

282
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,935
Moon Jar.

283
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,561
Yes, Moon Jar.

284
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,533
Hey, you should start Instagram.

285
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:57,459
Everyone does it nowadays.

286
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:05,682
It'd be too much to tell the secretary
to tell you this.

287
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:13,661
The PR Office
will give you a manual tomorrow.

288
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,771
Professor Lee.

289
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,387
How do you know my address?

290
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,264
- Hello.
- Yes, hi.

291
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:15,602
All I did was drive for 25 years.

292
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:19,602
To be honest,
Mr. Choi is hard to work for.

293
00:22:21,432 --> 00:22:25,343
I bet I worked for him the longest.

294
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:30,297
It must be tough on you.

295
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:37,652
This is from him.

296
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:41,293
Also...

297
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:45,518
I'm meeting all the people

298
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,325
who got fired suddenly just like you.

299
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,386
Pardon?

300
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm starting to learn about IT Solid.

301
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,498
I found quite a few odd things about it.

302
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,691
What do you mean?

303
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:09,515
During the four years of your service,

304
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,601
you were with him 18 hours a day.

305
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:16,489
You must know a lot of stuff I don't.

306
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:20,162
That's true, but--

307
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,614
Work-related stuff,

308
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,034
as well as personal.

309
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:28,066
Right?

310
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:30,730
Well...

311
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:34,738
It's true I feel wronged,

312
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:40,120
but I also got paid
for signing a non-disclosure agreement.

313
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,967
I can't do it.

314
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:45,590
Mr. Kim.

315
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:53,831
Someone like him
shouldn't become the mayor of Seoul.

316
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,266
You also know everything

317
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,755
about Im Soo-yeon, don't you?

318
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:10,510
Pardon?

319
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,847
LEE HYUN-JOO EQUALS ANNA EQUALS YU-MI

320
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,704
SUICIDE

321
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:27,812
YU-MI AND CHOI JI-HOON

322
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:41,062
They all look for the right time,

323
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,964
then line up behind the one
who looks like he'll win.

324
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:49,364
And when that guy wins,
they act like it's thanks to them.

325
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,133
They go around talking about that.

326
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,509
Yes. They always have excuses.

327
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,288
But I fight my own fights.

328
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,631
You're brave and honest.

329
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:03,503
As for me, I plan everything

330
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,143
and then give them the commands.

331
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,360
Yes. Bravo.

332
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:14,126
Also, voters can be so complicated.

333
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:17,772
They're super complicated
and they complain all the time.

334
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:20,971
They want housing prices to drop,

335
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:23,272
but their house has to rise in value.

336
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:27,756
They demand that we support
medium-sized companies to grow,

337
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,399
but they only want to work
for conglomerates.

338
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:32,634
You're right.

339
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:38,499
Part-time and contract workers
shouldn't be discriminated,

340
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:42,601
but their child must have
a stable full-time job.

341
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,107
I know. I know, Ji-hoon.

342
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,820
I know how you feel better than anyone.

343
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,566
But you know,

344
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:54,118
it's currently looking bright for you,

345
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:58,051
but this is when
you must be extra careful.

346
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,340
Do you know what I mean?

347
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,444
Thank you.

348
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,728
DONATION CERTIFICATE

349
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:09,844
We'll get a picture of just Professor Lee.

350
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:20,959
Time to eat.

351
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,702
Guys, come here.

352
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,117
He won't run away.

353
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:30,607
Let's eat.

354
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,067
This exhibition is the very first project

355
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,924
to reinterpret literary paintings
from the Joseon Dynasty

356
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,659
which aren't as widely known.

357
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:05,768
What's with the heavy air?

358
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,239
Why are you busy?

359
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,968
Hanbit Daily beat us to it.

360
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:13,719
Choi Ji-hoon had a common-law wife,

361
00:27:13,802 --> 00:27:15,863
and even an autistic son.

362
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,431
They're currently in the US.

363
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:19,363
What?

364
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:22,225
Hey. Just publish
what you're writing right now

365
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,202
and keep on releasing more stories
than them.

366
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:25,183
Yes, Sir!

367
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:26,461
- Reporter Hwang.
- Yes?

368
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,443
You're booked for an interview
with Lee Anna.

369
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:30,762
- They'll tell you the date later.
- Yes, Sir.

370
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:46,762
We're here.

371
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,738
I don't want to go home.

372
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:16,992
Here are the tax files
you asked for last week.

373
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:31,874
It's hard to do something in secret,
isn't it?

374
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:36,082
When you put it like that,

375
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:38,402
it feels like difficult work.

376
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,127
"Difficult work..."

377
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:45,295
It is.

378
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,595
It's something only you know,

379
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:52,380
and you can't talk to anyone else
about it.

380
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,555
It's hard.

381
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,559
More than that...

382
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:05,910
Go ahead. It's okay.

383
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:12,982
The most difficult thing
is reading the mood of my bosses.

384
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:20,037
"Mood"?

385
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:25,990
There's a limit to how much
I can understand from trying my best.

386
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,407
I know what that's like.

387
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,295
You have to read their eyes,

388
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,138
make presumptions,

389
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:40,102
and worry about it.

390
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:43,095
How do you know that?

391
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,735
Because

392
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,268
I've been through it before.

393
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,358
What?

394
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,653
I remember hating it,

395
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,193
but I can't remember what happened after.

396
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:10,140
What am I doing here?

397
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,074
You smoke, right?

398
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:21,442
Pardon?

399
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,515
Yes.

400
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:31,852
I want to try one.

401
00:30:44,336 --> 00:30:46,525
Good work today. See you tomorrow.

402
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:53,658
Don't bother getting out.

403
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,540
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

404
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:15,877
Gosh! You're so handsome.

405
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,953
- Thank you.
- My goodness.

406
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:19,163
I'll do my best.

407
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,444
Choi Ji-hoon!

408
00:31:22,856 --> 00:31:24,876
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

409
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:27,037
- You're so handsome.
- Thank you.

410
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,576
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

411
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,361
CHOI JI-HOON REACTS TO THE NEWS
THAT EXPOSED HIS PERSONAL LIFE

412
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:33,936
"THE TRUTH HASN'T BEEN DISCLOSED"

413
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:39,250
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

414
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:42,660
- It tastes like my mom's gimbap.
- Gosh, really?

415
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:46,105
My mom used to run a gimbap shop
in Tongyeong.

416
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,101
I see.

417
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,641
It reminds me of my mom.

418
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,369
- Best of luck.
- Good luck to you too.

419
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:52,858
Please stay strong. Thank you.

420
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:54,443
- Thank you.
- Sir, this way.

421
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:55,926
Vote number one for Choi Ji-hoon.

422
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,299
He's number one.

423
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,357
Could you go buy me a cup of coffee?

424
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,402
Sure.

425
00:32:04,434 --> 00:32:05,442
Yu-mi!

426
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:13,076
Sun-woo, are you well?

427
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:15,429
I'm going to Italy next month.

428
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:17,498
I was thinking of calling you too.

429
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:19,829
"Italy"?

430
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:22,189
Yes. I'm going
to a cooking school for a year.

431
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,953
I'll go although it'll be short.

432
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:26,533
I tried to find a new place to work,

433
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:29,377
but my experiences as a chef
aren't enough.

434
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:33,640
I see.

435
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:38,849
I worked for Marais for 10 years,
but I didn't even get severance pay.

436
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,151
Yes, I saw the news.

437
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:45,950
Did you?

438
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:50,385
Money sure is scary.
Look at what happened to Little Director.

439
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:55,176
You're right.

440
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:03,645
It's not a flaw
to get married twice these days.

441
00:33:03,728 --> 00:33:05,686
That couple doesn't have a child.

442
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:07,627
On top of that, his son is autistic,

443
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,264
so there's a humane story attached.

444
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:13,773
What an amazing couple.

445
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:17,343
What about his common-law wife?

446
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,027
Her name is Im Soo-yeon.

447
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:22,601
But she's nowhere to be found.

448
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:25,425
"Im Soo-yeon"?

449
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,940
Right. Lee Jung-il's property
that was bought under a borrowed name...

450
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:34,758
I heard
Choi Ji-hoon gave the story to you.

451
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,233
Ma'am, one more beer please.

452
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:44,302
Don't pretend ignorance.
Why didn't you write it?

453
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:45,845
That...

454
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,901
It just didn't feel like something for me.

455
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,367
You're strong-willed.

456
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,814
It's not about being strong-willed.
I have brave principles.

457
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,040
Sure.

458
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,266
Usually, brave people like you

459
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:06,055
die first in movies.

460
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:09,253
What is this?
You should be praising me as my senior.

461
00:34:10,106 --> 00:34:13,618
In my opinion, you're a loner
because you're neither this nor that.

462
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,681
I have two kids.

463
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:18,359
A father must live ambiguously.

464
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:26,291
Nothing is as scary as an honest advisor
who is prepared to die.

465
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:29,908
Nothing can be as empty
as the courage of the weak.

466
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:32,325
Your ancestors barely made a living
with the petty job in the countryside

467
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:35,167
before your father finally set foot...
-Ma'am, what is that?

468
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,427
It's a drama. Rerun of Jung Do-jeon

469
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,096
If you want to change the world,
become powerful first.

470
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,093
LEE IN-IM

471
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:45,402
If the world could change just from a fuss
from someone like you,

472
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,336
they wouldn't call this anarchy.

473
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,312
Wow.

474
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,279
Did he try to buy me over
with a drama line?

475
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,113
Who?

476
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,391
On top of that,
it wasn't even Jung Do-jeon who said it!

477
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:05,526
- What are you saying?
- I don't know. You don't have to know.

478
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,532
- Hey, Ji-won.
- What?

479
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:08,951
What's with this trending search?

480
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:10,218
What is it?

481
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:11,447
"Lee Anna".

482
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,757
There are no articles published yet,

483
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,295
but it keeps on trending.

484
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:21,037
1. GHOSTWRITER WROTE THESIS
FOR CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE

485
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:28,586
Mr. Jung.

486
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,897
Well...

487
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,510
How many presidential candidates

488
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,893
were booted out because of women?

489
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:40,493
Four, Sir.

490
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:44,784
I see. You know it so well.

491
00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:49,537
You know it well.

492
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,948
You guys told me to be careful,

493
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:01,389
so I didn't even go near hostess bars
ever since I got elected as the candidate.

494
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:04,303
I always do what you tell me to do,

495
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,829
but what have you done?

496
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:12,029
How did they find out...

497
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:18,865
that my son is in the US, you idiots?

498
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,980
Mr. Jung. What is your job?

499
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,142
Well?

500
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,865
- What do you do here?
- I'm sorry, Sir.

501
00:36:32,948 --> 00:36:36,186
Do you think sitting here in style
and ordering the guys what to do

502
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,742
can solve everything?

503
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,668
What is that?

504
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:50,680
A negative article about Professor Lee
was published.

505
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:58,017
Let me see it.

506
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,313
1. CHOI JI-HOON
2. CHOI JI-HOON'S WIFE

507
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,911
3. CHOI JI-HOON AND LEE ANNA
4. LEE ANNA

508
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,512
3. LEE ANNA
4. PROFESSOR LEE ANNA

509
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:19,419
Professor Lee.
You didn't pick up, so I came up.

510
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,997
Mr. Choi is looking for you.

511
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,063
Where is he?

512
00:37:24,146 --> 00:37:25,612
At the campaign camp.

513
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,490
I can't believe such a thing happened.

514
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:31,313
Seriously.

515
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:36,327
Anyway, I owe you.

516
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:39,119
Yes.

517
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:42,248
Let's take care of it that way.

518
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:43,967
Yes, okay.

519
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,289
Were you startled?

520
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:56,970
About what?

521
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:01,144
Sit down.

522
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:06,222
Alex White?

523
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,958
We found him.

524
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:11,703
What?

525
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,515
The rumor about a ghostwriter
writing your thesis is a false accusation.

526
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:20,705
They published a false story
based on a baseless rumor

527
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:23,560
in order to ruin Mr. Choi's reputation.
I already checked on it.

528
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:25,358
Luckily, it's almost morning in New York,

529
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,983
so Alex White will hold an interview
in about three hours

530
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,974
saying that he didn't write for you,
but that he was your study partner.

531
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:35,825
It'll be on the 8:00 a.m. news tomorrow.
That's all.

532
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,201
Good work.

533
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:39,405
You must be really upset, Ma'am.

534
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,500
You won't have to
worry about this anymore.

535
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,759
Okay, okay.

536
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:06,758
Avoid reporters for a while,
and don't expose yourself to the media.

537
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,936
I won't let you get away with it
if things go wrong.

538
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,548
So you already know everything.

539
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,469
Do you think you can live
as Lee Yu-mi again?

540
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:43,228
Alex.

541
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,548
How do you think I managed to find
that thesis broker so fast?

542
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:51,878
Aren't you curious?

543
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:07,877
Did you meet Lee Hyun-joo?

544
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:23,796
That crazy fearless woman contacted me.

545
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:37,948
It was you...

546
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,185
Be quiet.

547
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,308
Cho Yu-mi!

548
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,867
Take Professor Lee home.

549
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:37,674
Yu-mi.

550
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:57,480
When I was young,

551
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,642
the adults told me I look like a princess

552
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:05,439
and called me Anastasia.

553
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:12,176
That's why my second name
is its short form, Anna.

554
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:16,272
But it turns out,

555
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,759
someone named Anna Anderson

556
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:25,106
had been living

557
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,691
as if she's someone named Anastasia
who had died already.

558
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,882
Once I found out about that,

559
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,713
I stopped using that name.

560
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:05,670
You were standing in front of me
like this.

561
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,399
How was it living like you're me?

562
00:43:17,618 --> 00:43:18,655
Were you happy?

563
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:29,787
What I stole was fake too.

564
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,491
Is that why Lee Anna had that face on

565
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:37,421
while killing Lee Hyun-joo?

566
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:40,132
It wasn't me...

567
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:43,595
who did that.

568
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:45,772
No?

569
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,309
Just because you're foolish and pitiful,

570
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:04,773
doesn't mean you'll be forgiven.

571
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:12,099
Is it because they read
Divine Comedy by Dante?

572
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:15,773
Most people think

573
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,675
hell is a space.

574
00:44:24,154 --> 00:44:26,125
But in fact,
it's not a space, but a situation.

575
00:44:34,586 --> 00:44:36,061
Don't be so fast to cry.

576
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:41,821
Hell only starts now.

577
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,364
What do we do with you, Anna?

578
00:45:29,786 --> 00:45:32,872
You'll have to be lucky every time
in order to survive.

579
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:11,571
You'll only realize after you get it

580
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,772
whether you really wanted it or not.

581
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:47,855
Who is it?

582
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,982
Ji-won.

583
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:54,044
It's me, Yu-mi.

584
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:01,527
Yu-mi.
