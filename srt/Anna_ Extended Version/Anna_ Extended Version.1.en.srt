1
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,334
But you skipped breakfast too.

2
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:48,809
I'm not hungry.

3
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:53,917
Yu-mi, if you don't eat,

4
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,841
it'll upset the farmers who worked so hard

5
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,445
all year long.

6
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:05,478
No, Dad. They won't care
as long as they can sell their crops.

7
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:11,052
They wouldn't know if I ate or not.

8
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,391
BAEKMA TAILOR'S

9
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:27,951
It must be the soldiers
we talked about yesterday.

10
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,053
Yes.

11
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,524
Hi, Yu-mi.

12
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:42,932
I'm the one who called yesterday.

13
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:43,925
I see.

14
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,411
This is Colonel Phillips and his wife.

15
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,399
I see.

16
00:02:02,732 --> 00:02:03,621
Please sit here.

17
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,505
You can measure him first.

18
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:19,630
I'm Lee Yu-mi. I'm six years old.

19
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,140
Yu-mi, she's asking
if you know how to play the piano.

20
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,659
Sang Ho,
it's too expensive for a used piano.

21
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:19,872
These people have no conscience.

22
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,465
It's okay.

23
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:24,608
They looked after Yu-mi for two years,
and that takes effort too.

24
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,614
They only did that
because they're childless and bored.

25
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:30,059
You already gave them
so many suits for free.

26
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:31,894
I told you, it's okay.

27
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:32,915
Gosh.

28
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,642
I'm worried about Yu-mi.

29
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,213
There are so many things she wants to try,

30
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:28,907
and she wants to eat a lot of things too.

31
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,166
What's wrong with that?

32
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:35,147
We can't afford it.

33
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:41,407
Don't worry,
she can take care of herself.

34
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:56,745
Hi.

35
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:03,042
- Yu-mi.
- Yes?

36
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,981
Is this really your last week?

37
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,486
- Yes.
- Why?

38
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,488
Didn't you want to go
to an arts high school?

39
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,550
You're good at it.
You should keep doing it.

40
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:14,758
I did ballet

41
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,181
just as a hobby.

42
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:27,112
But if you stop now,

43
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,749
it'll mean the rumors are true.

44
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,525
Who says?

45
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,164
What rumors?

46
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,360
Bo-ra saw

47
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:42,360
your parents' tailor shop at the market
and said you're poor.

48
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,085
What else?

49
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:46,802
That your mom...

50
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,785
I think she's spreading rumors.

51
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,178
Tell me exactly what you heard.

52
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,356
That your mom is a mute.

53
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:01,637
Really?

54
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,117
I'll really quit after two more months.

55
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,246
Just until the fall competition, Dad.

56
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,158
It won't cost a lot to compete.

57
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,274
Just this once. Please?

58
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,164
I know that too.

59
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:31,867
But it's expensive to prepare
your costume and choreography.

60
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:35,733
I won't get makeup done,
and I'll borrow a costume.

61
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:36,941
It'll be the last time.

62
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:39,378
I really mean it. Dad, please.

63
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,620
Please let me compete just once, Dad.

64
00:08:56,638 --> 00:09:00,624
Just this once. Just this once.

65
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,931
Please.

66
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,547
Just once. Just this once.

67
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,699
Mom.

68
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,708
THE SEVENTH AUTUMN BALLET COMPETITION

69
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,547
Number 21
from the junior high youth group.

70
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,232
14-year-old Jung Bo-ra. The Nutcracker.

71
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,174
Mom, wait.

72
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,923
Number 27
from the junior high youth group.

73
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:20,039
14-year-old Lee Yu-mi. Esmeralda.

74
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,145
- Let's hurry up and leave.
- Wait.

75
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,400
Come on.

76
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,886
I can't find my wallet. Wait.

77
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,751
Mom, can you hold this?

78
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:26,636
I'll make sure
you're transferred within a year.

79
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,673
What are you saying? You're so full of it.

80
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:34,175
Mom.

81
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,883
- Woo-hee.
- Yes?

82
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,354
- You shouldn't give up.
- Okay.

83
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,854
There's still a lot of time.

84
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,044
- Let's try to improve your score.
- Okay.

85
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,502
Okay, you can go.

86
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,762
Thank you.

87
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,125
Sit down, Yu-mi.

88
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:05,162
I think

89
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:10,074
you could get admitted to this school
even as a humanities major.

90
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:16,119
We have five months
until the university entrance exams.

91
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,178
Arts?

92
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:22,361
But as an arts major...

93
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,287
I'm a little concerned
since you started arts late.

94
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,354
That's why I work hard at my art academy.

95
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:33,175
Okay, I'll put my trust in you.

96
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,897
Yu-mi,
your average is really good right now.

97
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,935
You're missing the extra classes,

98
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:44,704
but you can't let your marks drop
if you want to be an arts major.

99
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,431
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

100
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:49,976
Hi.

101
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,831
Okay, you can go.

102
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:59,216
My daughter received the top score
at her school.

103
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:00,367
That's why.

104
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,833
- Wow, the top score?
- Yes.

105
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:09,290
What grade is she in?

106
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,566
Her last year of high school.

107
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,713
When she was this small,

108
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:15,521
I made her coats and skirts myself.

109
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:19,255
I run a tailor's down at that market.

110
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,418
This is popular among kids these days.

111
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,001
Yes.

112
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:28,548
By the way, how much is that?

113
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,033
- The price?
- Yes.

114
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,879
We'll come back next time.

115
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:34,113
- Dad, let's go.
- What's wrong? Don't you like them?

116
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:36,609
- You said everyone wears them.
- Let's go.

117
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:39,364
Should we check somewhere else?

118
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:41,763
I thought about it,

119
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,472
and I'm the happiest about my top score.
That's good enough for me.

120
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,936
No, let's still go and--

121
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:48,674
Dad, can you buy me a pork cutlet?

122
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,391
I'll go to the academy after that.
Come on.

123
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,532
Okay, let's go eat some pork cutlet.

124
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:57,057
I'm hungry.

125
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,990
Let's hurry and eat some pork cutlet.

126
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,040
Yu-mi.

127
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,145
Must you go to an art college?

128
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,167
Why do you want to paint?

129
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,130
Sir, please.

130
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,737
How many times must I tell you?

131
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:39,551
Art is beautiful.

132
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,086
I like beautiful things.

133
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,597
No. No. That's vanity.

134
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,200
Look at this painting.

135
00:14:48,283 --> 00:14:50,200
It's not beautiful at all.

136
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:53,856
I'm asking because I'm anxious.
It's about getting accepted to a college.

137
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,591
Your marks are good.
You should do what you're good at.

138
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,635
Sir.

139
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,656
I always do everything I put my mind to.

140
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,584
It has always been like that.

141
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,932
ÉTRANGERE ATELIER

142
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:27,726
How was class?

143
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,764
Good.

144
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,451
The teacher's so annoying.

145
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:33,653
Really? Why is he always scolding you?

146
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:34,916
- I don't know.
- What?

147
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,250
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

148
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,246
Finish it by next week, all right?

149
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,945
Okay.

150
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,655
There's always someone who's late.

151
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,879
I'll see if you keep your promise.

152
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,173
MEET ME IN THE STORAGE AT LUNCH

153
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:49,077
Don't complain. Class president.

154
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,066
Attention.

155
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,317
Bow to our teacher.

156
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,525
- Thank you.
- Good work.

157
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,189
Hey, Yu-mi!

158
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,463
- Where did she go?
- I don't know. She rushed off.

159
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,680
Maybe she has to go really badly.

160
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,102
- Wow! Sweet and sour pork?
- You're here.

161
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:11,899
- Doesn't it look great?
- This is the best!

162
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,233
Do you like sweet and sour pork?

163
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,197
I love it.

164
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,346
Have your fill.

165
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,169
Don't rush, eat it slowly.

166
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,829
You should go in.

167
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:57,396
- Call me when you get home.
- Okay.

168
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,572
See you tomorrow.

169
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:07,450
Bye.

170
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:15,792
Bye.

171
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,403
Hurry up and go home.

172
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,543
Mom, I'm home.

173
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,555
Since when?

174
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,245
It's been three months.

175
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:39,437
Why didn't you tell us?

176
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,357
And you've been getting top scores
while dating?

177
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,200
- You're right.
- She's got it all.

178
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:46,340
You're so lucky.

179
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,061
Is it Son Jae-hyuk from Hongil High?

180
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,999
He was always pestering you.

181
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:53,263
- You're right.
- It must be him.

182
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,328
- Is he handsome?
- I heard he is.

183
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,473
I want to see him.

184
00:17:56,556 --> 00:18:00,806
It's hard to say who for now.

185
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,460
What is that?

186
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,396
It's pure love.

187
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,739
Hey, Yu-mi.

188
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,284
Ms. Jung wants to see you.

189
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,930
I'm so jealous.
It's been three months already.

190
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,761
Did you ask for me?

191
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:36,935
Yu-mi.

192
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:42,138
You must answer honestly to what I ask.

193
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,786
Have you been dating your music teacher?

194
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:57,563
Several people saw you,

195
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,482
and he also confessed.

196
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,354
It's common for students
to like their teachers.

197
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:14,673
But the fact that
there was a physical relationship...

198
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:17,163
That could be a problem.

199
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:25,131
What do you mean?

200
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,687
Hey, Yu-mi.

201
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:31,267
Do you think you can get away with it
because your grades are good

202
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,504
despite your financial problems
and we've been nice to you?

203
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,163
Sir.

204
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,583
Talking to Yu-mi alone won't help.

205
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,416
We need to bring her parents in--

206
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,865
Her parents?

207
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,259
Do they have any connections?

208
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:50,492
Mr. Kim.

209
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:53,795
There was an external report
to the police.

210
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,705
We can't solve it on our own.

211
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,090
We need to sort it out
before the school board and police come.

212
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:02,842
Sir, I'm so sorry.

213
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,147
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

214
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,003
What a thing to do
at your first teaching job.

215
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:17,204
I was only being nice to her.

216
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,294
She approached me first.

217
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:22,212
I should have declined. I'm sorry.

218
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,009
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,241
I'm sorry.

220
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:30,415
What do you mean, approach?

221
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:37,736
It wasn't like that.

222
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,225
Why are you lying?

223
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:41,406
Hey, watch it.

224
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:44,492
Be quiet.

225
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,184
Don't be cheeky
when the adults are talking.

226
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,515
I'm sorry, Ms. Jung. I'm sorry, Sir.

227
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,883
Attention.

228
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,214
Bow to our teacher.

229
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,987
Thank you.

230
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:27,774
Hey, is it true?

231
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,238
Why would you ask her that?

232
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,958
We have to confirm.

233
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,723
Still, don't ask things like that.

234
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,402
My sweet baby,
eat well and don't get sick.

235
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,384
Take care of yourself.

236
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:46,406
What about that jerk?

237
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,928
Why didn't he get fired?
Why only a suspension?

238
00:22:51,082 --> 00:22:54,205
Why must I run away
this early in the morning?

239
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:12,704
Sir, what you told us was different.

240
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:16,590
Our school does not accept kids
who were forced to transfer.

241
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:19,127
I beg you.

242
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:23,940
There are only four months
before the entrance exam.

243
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:26,269
It's a sensitive time for everyone.

244
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:27,782
If she causes any trouble...

245
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,933
No, no. That won't happen.

246
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:33,068
She's a good student.

247
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:36,013
She got second place
on the mock test last month,

248
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:38,361
and she got the top score on her midterms.

249
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,057
Okay, Sir. Please sit down.

250
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,040
Okay.

251
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,540
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

252
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,008
Hello.

253
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:56,302
Are you Ms. Jung Ha-na
at Hongjae Girls' High School?

254
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:59,354
Hello.
I'm calling from Seowon Girls' High School

255
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,181
where Lee Yu-mi transferred to.

256
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,863
We noticed after she transferred

257
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:07,191
that she was marked as a special student.

258
00:24:07,274 --> 00:24:10,978
Can you share what happened?

259
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:12,113
Yes. Yes.

260
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,113
Okay.

261
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:18,377
Yes. Her scores are great, but...

262
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:26,052
Okay, then.
Ms. Jung, I'll try talking to Yu-mi.

263
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,698
Yes, take care.

264
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,446
Bye.

265
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:39,746
Come here.

266
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,314
What's your average?

267
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,347
A.

268
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:55,756
What was your standing for the mock test?

269
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:57,969
I was in the top five percent.

270
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:08,326
Yu-mi, there are only four months.

271
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:12,151
Don't try to make any friends
and just focus on studying.

272
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,028
Understand?

273
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:15,814
Okay.

274
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,998
Sir, we need to talk.

275
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:24,217
- Okay.
- Shall we go over there?

276
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:38,717
Your plan
was to go to a university here anyway.

277
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:41,561
You just came to Seoul
a little earlier than planned.

278
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:46,853
Your new homeroom teacher looked nice.
Don't you agree?

279
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,470
It'll be exam season soon. Hang in there.

280
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,584
It wasn't like

281
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:01,453
what people were talking about.

282
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,876
I know.

283
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:15,981
Buy yourself a uniform
and other stuff you need with this.

284
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:22,141
A student told me
the food at this boarding house is good.

285
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,486
I'll take care of it.
Hurry up and go home.

286
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,958
Don't cry too much. It can make you ill.

287
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,574
I'll get going.

288
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:55,626
- Are you heading out?
- Yes.

289
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:59,240
My daughter has never been to Seoul,

290
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:00,827
so please take good care of her.

291
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,322
Please don't worry.

292
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:03,722
By the way, where are you from?

293
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,686
- We're from Hongcheon.
- You came from so far away.

294
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:10,169
Yes. After her exams,

295
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:12,352
she'll try to go to a university here.
She moved to Seoul in advance.

296
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:15,176
Sorry we only had the big room vacant.

297
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,332
You must be a bit pressured.

298
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:18,625
No, not at all. Thank you.

299
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,603
No problem.

300
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:21,189
- Bye now.
- Bye.

301
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:37,858
Dad!

302
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:43,962
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,833
Call me.

304
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:14,584
Can you lower the volume?

305
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,281
Mom.

306
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,655
Is that you, Mom?

307
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,463
Don't you miss me?

308
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,551
I wish I could hear your voice.

309
00:29:52,731 --> 00:29:54,042
Time's up.

310
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,843
Stop marking and put your pens down.

311
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:57,073
Hands on your heads.

312
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,576
The last row
will collect the answer sheets.

313
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:08,921
The first row will collect the questions.

314
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,170
Let me repeat myself.
The last exam was super easy.

315
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:21,786
All of you got high marks,
so don't be so proud.

316
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:23,811
You need to subtract 30 points
from your score

317
00:30:23,894 --> 00:30:25,633
to get your usual score.

318
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:27,991
That's too much.

319
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:30,092
Jung Hye-min. Jung Hye-min, come out.

320
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:33,564
Choi Yeon-ji.

321
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:37,465
Lee Yu-mi.

322
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,180
Kim Jung-mi.

323
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:46,885
Song Min-ji.

324
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,892
Jung Se-young.

325
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:55,883
Jang Moon-ju.

326
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,402
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have not been accepted.

327
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:07,481
Examinee number 421723.

328
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:12,265
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have not been accepted.

329
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:18,916
Yu-mi, you have a call from Hongcheon.

330
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:31,938
Hey, Dad.

331
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,329
Why don't you ever call?

332
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:35,833
Your mom's worried.

333
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,889
I got a part-time job
since it's the break. I was busy.

334
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:45,539
People wear ready-made clothes these days,

335
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:47,105
so I'm losing my regulars.

336
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:49,620
How's Mom?

337
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:51,945
How is she doing?

338
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,657
Well... We went to the hospital yesterday.

339
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:01,360
They say she's in her early stage
of dementia.

340
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:03,329
What?

341
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:06,755
Yes. Dementia.

342
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:11,814
Will you come over one of these weekends?

343
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:18,169
I'm sorry.

344
00:32:19,568 --> 00:32:20,634
It's okay.

345
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,890
You don't have to come
if you don't want to see people.

346
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,084
And...

347
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:30,603
By the way,

348
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:37,154
they didn't make
the admission announcement yet, right?

349
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:48,155
I got admitted.

350
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:49,809
You did?

351
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,177
Well done, Yu-mi.

352
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,529
Everyone asked, but we were worried
since you haven't called.

353
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,244
Honey!

354
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:01,682
Yu-mi says she made it!

355
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,935
Why didn't you call right away?

356
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:05,885
It's not that big of a deal.

357
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:07,244
What are you saying?

358
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:09,551
You did well.

359
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:13,872
I'll call you back later.

360
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:20,336
Congratulations, Yu-mi.

361
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,255
You're always so quiet, so I didn't know.

362
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:25,266
Tell me if there's anything
you want to eat. I'll make it.

363
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,811
Gosh, it's cold.

364
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:44,371
Dad. Dad, over here.

365
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,339
Yu-mi!

366
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:57,702
The entrance ceremony ended already.

367
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,526
Did we come too late?

368
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,853
We were delayed
because your mom felt carsick.

369
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:04,014
It's okay. There wasn't much to it.

370
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:05,179
Did you get sick?

371
00:34:05,262 --> 00:34:07,877
I had to throw up at the rest stop.
I'm sorry.

372
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:13,436
We wanted to tour around your school.

373
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,264
There's nothing much. We can do it later.

374
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:16,335
Here's a gift.

375
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:20,725
Everyone has one of these things nowadays.

376
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:22,411
But this is expensive...

377
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,938
What are you saying?
I have to give the best to my daughter.

378
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:29,671
We better take a picture.

379
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:31,751
Mom wants to take a picture.

380
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,191
A picture?

381
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,695
Let's take one right here.

382
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:38,272
- What about the camera?
- It's right here.

383
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:40,268
I'm sorry,
but could you take a picture for us?

384
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:43,818
Thank you.

385
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:45,620
- Let's take it here.
- Okay.

386
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:53,571
Here we go.

387
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:55,920
One, two, three.

388
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:03,368
- Here you go.
- You shouldn't have.

389
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:07,079
She got accepted thanks to you
who took a good care of her.

390
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:08,731
I don't know how else to thank you.

391
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,344
It was nothing.

392
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,372
I was lucky to have a student
so well-behaved and quiet.

393
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:14,998
- Really?
- Of course.

394
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:17,673
Thank you for your kind words.

395
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:18,823
No problem.

DAEHYEON ACADEMY

397
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:33,001
Can I register for a comprehensive class
for repeaters?

398
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,065
YU-MI'S TUITION FEE

399

"Suspect".

400
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,776
I enjoyed the melon thanks to you.

401
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:48,219
I heard you're a freshman at our school.
The landlady told me.

402
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,398
I'm from Daegu.

403
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,748
I'm a sophomore in Political Science.
Han Ji-won.

404
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,850
I repeated a year. What about you?

405
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,033
I'm

406
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,249
Lee Yu-mi.

407
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:09,271
You're shy with strangers. Lee Yu-mi?

408
00:37:15,055 --> 00:37:17,548
Our school magazine
is looking for new writers.

409
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,972
Are you interested?

410
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:25,273
I'm sorry.
I've never done anything like that before.

411
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:31,348
Bye.

412
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,404
Yu-mi! Shall we go together?

413
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:40,371
Do you want to join Monte Cristo?

414
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:41,632
A dance club?

415
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:45,823
Yu-mi, have you decided on a club?

416
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:47,641
No.

417
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,643
You should choose carefully.

418
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,244
They sell naengmyeon
at the cafeteria, and it's good.

419
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:53,345
Make sure to try it.

420
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,529
Can I have your number?

421
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,296
- What?
- I'll give you mine too.

422
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,557
Okay...

423
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,113
Here.

Lee Yu-mi.

425
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:15,450
That building is the cultural center.

426
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:18,240
Our editorial team
is on the second floor. Okay?

427
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,338
Hey, Han Ji-won!

428
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,227
Hey.

429
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,457
I'll get going. Bye.

430
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:27,125
Okay. Bye.

431
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,800
Pay us a visit when you're bored. Bye!

432
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,488
Hey, hurry up.

433
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:33,105
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

434
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,904
Why are you so late?

435
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,680
- You guys are really angry.
- No, it's okay.

436
00:38:54,111 --> 00:38:55,115
Excuse me.

437
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,322
Do you know where the cultural center is?

438
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,970
Thank you.

439
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:13,340
This makes 3 sin B and 3 sin C.

440
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:16,302
What value are we looking for here?

441
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,230
We need to find the degree of angle A.

442
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,857
That's the question.

443
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,107
Then, take a look at this.

444
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,140

HAN JI-WON FROM THE BOARDING HOUSE

446
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:40,907
Why is this so good?

447
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,157
You need to eat more and gain weight.

448
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,986
- You're too skinny.
- Have your fill.

449
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:47,737
Don't be shy and just eat confidently.

450
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,211
Isn't she so cute?

451
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:52,403
She was so startled
when I first talked to her.

452
00:39:52,486 --> 00:39:54,888
- You were like that too.
- Me?

453
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,064
- You were the same.
- Exactly.

454
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:57,367
Like attracts like.

455
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,917
You have strange memories.

456
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:04,727
It's my first time eating with
so many people since coming here.

457
00:40:05,293 --> 00:40:08,099
Really? Have you been eating alone?

458
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,928
- Without any friends?
- Yes.

459
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:12,815
Did you say you're from Hongcheon?

460
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:14,889
We have a lot
of local alumni associations.

461
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:17,586
- Right.
- I'm from Inje.

462
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:19,127
Which school in Hongcheon
are you from?

463
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:22,474
No, Hongcheon is where
my relatives live.

464
00:40:22,557 --> 00:40:23,749
I see.

465
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:26,749
I lived abroad.

466
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,651
- Really? Where?
- Where?

467
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:31,026
In America.

468
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,384
My father has a business there.

469
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:35,067
Then your English must be good.

470
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,338
Are you a native speaker? Please teach me.

471
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,526
Should we start a TOEIC study group?

472
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,145
No, I'm not good at it.

473
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,184
What major are you again?

474
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,074
Aesthetics.

475
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:50,433
I used to paint, but I haven't been
able to after coming to Korea.

476
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,427
- You paint but are in Aesthetics?
- I know, right?

477
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,409
Yu-mi.

478
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:58,962
Small.

479
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:01,200
- It's perfect.
- It suits you.

480
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:03,342
You can have it. It's free for freshmen.

485
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,330
No? Do you want to borrow it?

486
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,160
- It's really good.
- Yes.

487
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:28,996
But you have to return it
to the school library by tomorrow.

488
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,426
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

489
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,411
Good luck. You can do it.

490
00:41:32,494 --> 00:41:34,283
Hey, Dad. It's me.

491
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,222
I have to attend a conference.

492
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:41,280
No, that was a club trip.
This is a conference.

493
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:45,691
My allowance isn't enough
to pay the membership fee.

494
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:46,933
EDITORIAL REPORTER - LEE YU-MI

495
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:49,609
Yes, we get together to present.

496
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,040
By tomorrow, okay?

497
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:53,391
Thank you, Dad.

498
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:03,619
Comprehensive class for repeaters.
My name is Lee Yu-mi. It's for this month.

499
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:08,892
Comprehensive class for repeaters?
Lee Yu-mi.

500
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,214
Your attendance...

501
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,429
If you keep missing classes like this,
you could get expelled.

502
00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:20,328
There's only a month left
before the exams.

503
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:23,751
I'm sorry. I won't miss any from now.

504
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:30,410
Time's up.

505
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:33,366
Raise both hands above your heads.

506
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:38,732
Stop marking and raise your hands.

507
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,572
The last person in each row
will collect the answer sheets.

508
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:53,628
Those in the front row
can collect the questions.

509
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,312
It will be hard to get admitted
with your score.

510
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,580
I'm not sure.

511
00:43:10,663 --> 00:43:13,056
Are you interested in any other schools?

512
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:22,700
Hello?

513
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:24,913
Yu-mi. Where have you been?

514
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:26,152
Did something happen?

515
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:29,913
No.

516
00:43:30,753 --> 00:43:33,811
I've been busy.

517
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:35,958
I see.

518
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:38,341
Are you coming
to the general assembly tomorrow?

519
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:41,319
The general assembly?

520
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:43,509
The assembly for
editorial departments in Seoul.

521
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:46,308
I see.

522
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:48,885
I mentioned it last time.

523
00:43:50,123 --> 00:43:52,273
Right... I forgot.

524
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,154
What is it? Can't you come?

525
00:43:55,848 --> 00:43:57,681
I can. I'll be there.

526
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:00,211
What time is it?

527
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,881
All right.

528
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:03,881
Hello. Long time no see.

529
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:07,483
I'm Han Ji-won
from Ehyeon Womans University.

530
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,845
Hello, I'm Han Yu-young.

531
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:12,114
Hello, I'm Kim Min-ji.

532
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,207
Hello, I'm Lee Yu-mi.

533
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,570
You're beautiful!

534
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:23,500
As I suspected,
our new recruit is very popular.

535
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,685
I'm so proud.

536
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:25,961
She's pretty.

537
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:29,971
Thank you. Our university
admits people based on looks.

538
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:37,371
At last year's assembly,
we said we'd talk about this year's...

539
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:43,610
Watch carefully.

540
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:47,077
One, two, three.

541
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,398
It disappeared.

542
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,550
Here it is!

543
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:52,707
Amazing.

544
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:57,162
- What happened?
- Gosh, a doll is talking.

545
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,128
GENERAL ASSEMBLY
OF UNIVERSITY EDITORIALS IN SEOUL

546
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:16,259
Why are you outside?

547
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:21,648
The heater

548
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:24,550
gave me a headache.

549
00:45:29,304 --> 00:45:30,619
Do you want to go for a walk?

550
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:33,745
This way will take us
to our school's back gate.

551
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,109
Aren't you cold?
You don't have a jacket on.

552
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:56,695
I'm okay.

553
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:04,555
It's snowing.

554
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,023
You're right.

555
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:15,753
It's a bit chilly.

556
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:53,208
Hello?

557
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:56,119
Yu-mi? Is this Yu-mi?

558
00:46:58,245 --> 00:47:00,432
Yes, Ma'am. It's Yu-mi.

559
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:03,515
Hey, what are you doing?

560
00:47:03,598 --> 00:47:05,995
You better come to school
to pick up your report card.

561
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:07,861
It was announced ages ago.

562
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:14,648
What did I get?

563
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:19,469
Your score is worse than last year.

564
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:23,125
Yu-mi. Must you go
to Ehyeon Womans University?

565
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,588
Can't we lower the goal
and go to a different one in Seoul?

566
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:29,921
Don't repeat a third time.
It'll be too hard on you.

567
00:47:30,004 --> 00:47:32,067
Keeping your pride
isn't that important.

568
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:38,401
I'll call you back later. Okay.

569
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,522
Do you want help?

570
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,516
Yes. Can you help me put it on?

571
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,930
Do you think
I'll be able to carry this around?

572
00:48:09,702 --> 00:48:11,232
Where are you going?

573
00:48:11,315 --> 00:48:13,404
Backpacking in Europe.

574
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:16,715
Wow. I almost fell backwards.

575
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:18,621
You're traveling? What about school?

576
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,901
My classes finished last week.

577
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:24,011
I tutored part-time
for seven months for this.

578
00:48:24,895 --> 00:48:26,443
What are you doing during your break?

579
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:32,456
By the way, it's my first time
going abroad, so I'm scared.

580
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,162
Shoot, I'm late.

581
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,592
Bye, Yu-mi.

582
00:48:36,675 --> 00:48:38,382
Okay, bye.

583
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:34,188
I don't like it when you
touch my stuff without asking.

584
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:38,726
It was just sitting right there...

585
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,364
Why do you have that anyway?

586
00:49:42,656 --> 00:49:43,684
For tutoring.

587
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:47,053
I thought you didn't want a part-time job.

588
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,844
I want to save up on my own
to go backpacking.

589
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:56,916
Really?

590
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:07,496
I'm going to New York next year.

591
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,719
- New York?
- Yes.

592
00:50:09,802 --> 00:50:12,128
It's kind of like
an exchange student program.

593
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,407
I'll spend my last year at that school.

594
00:50:18,355 --> 00:50:19,446
I see.

595
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,423
Are you upset?

596
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:26,477
No, it's good news for you.

597
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:29,158
Congratulations.

598
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:37,037
Don't go backpacking.

599
00:50:38,793 --> 00:50:40,088
Should we go together?

600
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:44,859
Together?

601
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:46,118
Yes.

602
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,532
You can study English for a year,

603
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:49,849
and I can go to school.

604
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:55,414
Anyway, my mom suggested
we get married after graduation.

605
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:57,356
She said we should go together.

606
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:01,115
She wants to meet you.

607
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:05,085
We'll end the class here.

608
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,044
Thank you.

609
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:12,338
Wait, guys.

610
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:15,292
Raise your hand if you're a repeater.

611
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,163
Hands down.

612
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,303
Who's repeating a third time?

613
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,737
Okay, down. Fourth time?

614
00:51:28,862 --> 00:51:31,612
Hey, don't laugh. How can you laugh?

615
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:33,614
Guys.

616
00:51:33,697 --> 00:51:35,508
Yu-mi.

617
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:39,403
Jae-ho is moving so far away to study,

618
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:41,369
so I'm worried about sending him alone.

619
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:44,801
Do you think your parents
will give you the permission?

620
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,732
Right, what does your father do?

621
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:51,937
Gosh, it's cold. It's so cold.

622
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:55,742
Isn't it strange?

623
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:59,033
The weather gets really cold
on the day of the entrance exam.

624
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:05,329
Time flies, doesn't it?

625
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:08,972
You sat there to have your meal
before taking yours.

626
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:15,207
I'll go and spend a night in Hongcheon
before returning tomorrow.

627
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:17,186
Really?

628
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:18,920
Your parents will be so happy to see you.

629
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:23,305
Gosh, you shouldn't have bought anything.

630
00:52:27,238 --> 00:52:28,385
It's bitter.

631
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:31,447
What's good for you is always bitter.

632
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,348
Why didn't you call us beforehand?

633
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:37,549
I could've picked you up
from the terminal.

634
00:52:39,352 --> 00:52:40,380
Right...

635
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,010
Dad, I was selected
as a distinguished student.

636
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:48,026
Really?

637
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,273
Do you get a scholarship?

638
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:54,640
No, it's not like that.

639
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:56,648
It's better.
I can go on a language training.

640
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:59,299
What is that?

641
00:53:00,075 --> 00:53:04,456
I can go to the States
and study English for a year.

642
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:05,599
With a scholarship?

643
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,830
No, not really.

644
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,288
They only give me the opportunity.

645
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:18,360
I see.

646
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,909
Everyone goes abroad to learn languages
these days. It's a must.

647
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:30,529
Dad.

648
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:33,906
Please help me just this once.

649
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:39,032
I really want to excel.

650
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,066
I don't think there will be
another chance like this.

651
00:53:44,182 --> 00:53:45,881
I promise this will be the last time.

652
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:50,036
Please, Dad.

653
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:56,263
Kang Jae-ho and Lee Yu-mi.
Two people heading to New York, right?

654
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:57,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

655
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,037
We tried our best to be prepared,

656
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,218
but there's just so much to check.

657
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,593
Also, here.

658
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:10,085
This has his herbal medicine.

659
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:11,771
Please make sure he takes them.

660
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:12,829
I will, Mother.

661
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:15,037
I feel at ease

662
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,201
now that you're going with him.

663
00:54:18,551 --> 00:54:21,118
Make sure to look carefully
when you're picking the place to stay.

664
00:54:21,201 --> 00:54:22,829
If you don't, you'll end up--

665
00:54:22,912 --> 00:54:25,179
Mom. That's enough.

666
00:54:27,161 --> 00:54:29,979
By the way, where's your father?

667
00:54:30,062 --> 00:54:32,084
Gosh, that old man...

668
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:36,043
From Incheon to New York JFK Airport.

669
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:38,000
The passengers are
Kang Jae-ho and Lee Yu-mi.

670
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:41,266
Please go to gate 36 before boarding time.

671
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,924
- Thank you.
- Sure.

672
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:50,550
Mom's over the top, isn't she?

673
00:54:50,633 --> 00:54:52,948
I thought she'd come in
all the way here with us.

674
00:54:53,031 --> 00:54:54,894
She's just worried, that's all.

675
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:58,769
Should I take a close look
at your passport picture?

676
00:54:58,852 --> 00:54:59,971
No, don't.

677
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:04,332
We have some time left, so wait here.

678
00:55:04,415 --> 00:55:06,157
- I'll get us some coffee.
- Okay.

679
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,975
Right. Call your father one more time.

680
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:11,680
I'm worried.

681
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:12,774
Okay, I will.

682
00:55:31,836 --> 00:55:32,846
Hey, Mom.

683
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:37,407
Dad. I'll be back soon.

684
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,369
What are you saying? Talk slowly.

685
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:43,479
Yu-mi is a fake. She's fake!

686
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,826
Your father asked the TAs
and checked the whole school.

687
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:53,066
They don't have a student
named Lee Yu-mi.

688
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:54,076
What?

689
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,612
Are you listening to me?

690
00:55:58,936 --> 00:56:03,293
They say there is no such student
at that school.

691
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,814
Where on earth did you meet such a girl?

692
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:15,626
You didn't board the plane yet, right?

693
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,050
I came back to the airport.

694
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:22,808
What about Mom?

695
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,610
Okay.
