1
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,501
Han Ji-won.
Come over here.

2
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,029
How dare you look straight into my eyes?

3
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,319
Clench your teeth.

4
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:50,430
You little punk.

5
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:52,530
Punk.

6
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:53,971
Stand up.

7
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:56,266
Punk.

8
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,528
Stand up straight!

9
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,068
Say you're sorry.

10
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,523
Hurry up and say it.

11
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,963
Say you're sorry.

12
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:27,003
You're fearless, aren't you?

13
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,299
The Education Office?

14
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:30,931
How dare you make a report?

15
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,549
All school retreats are like that.

16
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,555
How do you know
if the teachers pocketed any money?

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,638
- Is she getting a beating?
- No way.

18
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,343
- Hey!
- This is insane.

19
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,578
This is crazy.

20
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:51,474
What do we do?

21
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,733
Ji-won.

22
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:56,452
Hey, are you okay?

23
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,997
Hey, you're bleeding.

24
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,938
Ji-won, you should go
and beg for forgiveness.

25
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,920
They'll really kill you at this rate.

26
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,170
All the teachers are about to get fired.

27
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:11,743
Of course they won't leave you alone.

28
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:15,378
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

29
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,772
Where are you going now?

30
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,570
The homeroom teacher will make a fuss
if he finds out.

31
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:21,154
You should go to the infirmary.

32
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:22,777
Go lie down and rest.

33
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,427
I'm going to the Education Office.

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,993
Hey!

35
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,464
Don't go there.

36
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:32,815
- Are you crazy?
- She's really crazy.

37
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,458
What's wrong with her?

38
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,545
Is she out of her mind?

39
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:43,632
She was a well-dressed instructor
who was also friendly.

40
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,403
That's why the kids liked her.

41
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,407
How did her students do with admissions?

42
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,721
Let me see...

43
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,036
One went to Yale, two went to CalArts,

44
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,393
One went to Chicago, and three to SUB.

45
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,135
She sent one to the UK too.

46
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,287
She sent quite a few of them. 8 or 9?

47
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:11,887
Did you find anything out of the ordinary?

48
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,511
Right!

49
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:20,396
Ms. Lee's English wasn't that great.

50
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:24,446
Her British accent was strange.

51
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,463
Did she have a British accent?

52
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,721
Yes.

53
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:32,818
Sometimes my students
aren't so good in Korean,

54
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,785
so I heard her speak English.
But her accent was a little weird.

55
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,785
Hey.

56
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:46,762
Do you hold onto degree certificates?

57
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,836
Yes, I do.

58
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:52,432
Why do you ask?

59
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,743
Hurry up and show me.

60
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,081
CEO KIM JUNG-MI

61
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,977
Forty-two.

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,049
MADAM BOO HYUN-JIN
MRS. LEE WON-HYUNG

63
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,141
Three, four...

64
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,446
Forty-five.

65
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,454
- Hello.
- Welcome.

66
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:46,580
Please take me to Hongseong Market.

67
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,442
- "Hongseong Market"?
- Yes.

68
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:49,546
Not the New Hongcheon Market?

69
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:51,923
No, Hongseong Market. What is it?

70
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:56,208
There's nothing there anymore
because they're building a train station.

71
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,360
It's just a field now.

72
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,081
I see.

73
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,883
I'm trying to look for someone who used to
have a shop at Hongseong Market.

74
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,004
You should go to New Hongcheon Market.

75
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,331
Everyone who used to run shops there
all moved to New Hongcheon Market.

76
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:12,859
Really? Can you take me there?

77
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,155
Okay.

78
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,451
Do you know Myungjin Construction?

79
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,690
You met their youngest son.

80
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:34,180
You know, Oh Myung-hoon. Busan's mayor.

81
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,428
He's my friend. You met him once.

82
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:40,716
He's a friend I met in the army.

83
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,491
Were we corporals?
Anyway, there was an election,

84
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,050
and he kept on telling me
to vote for the ruling party.

85
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,510
I told him I couldn't care less who won.

86
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,051
That's when he said this to me.

87
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:58,256
"Anyone who says is not interested
in politics like you

88
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,859
is someone from the lower class."

89
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:10,202
Ever since then,
those words repeated in my head.

90
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:13,869
It offended me.

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,292
What is politics anyway?

92
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:24,803
That's when I first started
to think about politics.

93
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:31,594
The state itself and social order

94
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,711
are all naive answers.

95
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:36,905
So what's the essence?

96
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,774
It's what you like.

97
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,743
Seeking self-interest.

98
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:55,884
People aren't interested
because they don't know this.

99
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,534
About what?

101
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:04,786
I don't feel so good,
so I'll get up first.

102
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:47,927
TTANGJIB RESTAURANT

103
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,519
Hello.

104
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,447
Welcome.

105
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,996
I didn't order anything yet.

106
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,560
We only serve sundaeguk in the morning.

107
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,712
Okay. I'll enjoy it.

108
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,012
You look like you're from Seoul.

109
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,306
Do I look like I'm from Seoul?

110
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,694
All pretty girls tend to be from Seoul.

111
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,542
Thank you.

112
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:52,795
Has it been long
since you ran your business here?

113
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:53,812
Me?

114
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:58,150
Maybe 40 years? More or less?

115
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,342
Were you at Hongseong Market too?

116
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,383
That's my hometown.

117
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,491
I see.

118
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,287
Do you know the tailor's there?

119
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,997
Baekma.

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,204
There was only one tailor's.

121
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:12,715
Then,

122
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:20,466
do you know their daughter Lee Yu-mi?

123
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:23,088
Of course. Hong-ju's daughter Yu-mi.

124
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,819
She's in the US right now.

125
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,785
Do you know Yu-mi?

126
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,317
Mrs. Kim told me.

127
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:38,421
Yes.

128
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:41,738
Really? I didn't know.

129
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:45,659
Yes.

130
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:47,627
Should we?

131
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:52,955
I have some time in the afternoon.

132
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,905
Sure, Hannam-dong would be nice.

133
00:09:56,995 --> 00:10:00,051
Okay, I got it. Bye.

134
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:08,278
She was a beautiful, popular,
and smart student.

135
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,086
She was what kids these days call
an attention seeker.

136
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:18,963
She was a bit like that.

137
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,760
She liked getting attention.

138
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,043
I see.

139
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,582
During her senior year of high school,

140
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,895
she dated one of the younger teachers.

141
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,756
That became a huge problem.

142
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,666
A teacher?

143
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:40,336
Yes.

144
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,652
It happened quite frequently back then.

145
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:48,844
Is that why she transferred
to a school in Seoul?

146
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:49,827
Yes.

147
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,823
I see.

148
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,329
When I look back now,

149
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:57,286
us adults were irresponsible.

150
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:02,616
Yu-mi was honest about her feelings,

151
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:09,192
but that young teacher blamed her
so that he could get out of it.

152
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,226
To be honest,
nothing changed with schools.

153
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:19,717
They're fast to cover up any problems
as they rise.

154
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,078
Do you know what happened to her
after that?

155
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,184
After she transferred
to a school in Seoul,

156
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:35,607
she visited me out of the blue
in the middle of the night.

157
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:42,602
I feared a student for the first time
since I became a teacher.

158
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,527
She cried all night long

159
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,752
before she took
the first train back to Seoul.

160
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,897
That happened 2 or 3 times.

161
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,954
I didn't see her after that.

162
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,808
I see.

163
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,471
It's my first time eating with
so many people since coming here.

164
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,325
From my experience,

165
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,894
kids who grow up
with people telling them they're smart

166
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:16,864
become extremely vulnerable
when they think they're no longer useful.

167
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,179
I'm curious about her too.

168
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,333
I wonder what kind of person she became.

169
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,993
I see.

170
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:32,382
I'm sorry, but please let me take this.

171
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:33,879
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

172
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,116
Hello?

173
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,787
Hey, it's me.
Where have you been all day?

174
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,687
You need to meet
Candidate Choi Ji-hoon tonight.

175
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,296
Make sure to clear time for it.

176
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,695
Yes, but I'm currently out of the province
to gather news material.

177
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,905
Could Reporter Hwang go instead?

178
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:56,355
I know, and it's good
that you're working hard.

179
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:59,213
But you should at least thank the person
who got you this job,

180
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,385
don't you think?

181
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:02,336
Pardon?

182
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,371
It's at 7:00 p.m.
I'll text you the location.

183
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,266
Don't say anything ridiculous to him.

184
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,027
Sir.

185
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,891
Don't be late. He hates it the most.

186
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:14,529
I'm going into a meeting.
Talk to you later.

187
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:35,906
Thank you for making the time
when you're so busy.

188
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:37,715
The election is so soon too.

189
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,653
It was my pleasure.

190
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,044
I'll see you again next time.

191
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:44,213
Sure. Let's meet more often now.

192
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,927
Okay. I'll get going.

193
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,508
Please go ahead.

194
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,994
- Did you do what I asked?
- Yes.

195
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,855
- I'll bring your car.
- Okay.

196
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,182
Hey, it's me.

197
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,701
I'm in Hannam-dong right now.

198
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,910
We just parted ways.
She wasn't rude to me at all.

199
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,422
No, she's super charming.

200
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,868
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

201
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,018
How many times
do I have to come to the airport?

202
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,497
He doesn't do a single thing right.

203
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:43,113
The flight was delayed.
It wasn't his fault.

204
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,045
So what?

205
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,190
Is it that difficult
to tell me it got delayed

206
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,066
and update me the right time?

207
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,539
He didn't do it on purpose.

208
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,766
And the divorce application is still
in progress. Don't be so cold to him.

209
00:14:57,849 --> 00:15:00,637
Be friendly when you talk, okay?

210
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,909
I have nothing to say.

211
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:05,941
Hyun-joo, please listen to me.

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,458
It's not too late to change your mind--

213
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,517
Mom.

214
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,223
You know I never had anything

215
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:19,323
I cherished so much in my life before.

216
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:25,007
But now I have something like that too.

217
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,189
Something I cherish and adore to death.

218
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,420
She's all I need.

219
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,538
This is why
we're not meant for each other.

220
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,599
Do you get it?

221
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,893
It snowed a lot, so...

222
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,079
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:50,885
Sure. It must've been difficult
to travel so far with a child.

224
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,692
This is Stella's stuff.

225
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,493
She's been suffering from eczema
for three months.

226
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:55,957
Please pay extra attention to that.

227
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,419
Okay. Thank you.

228
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:01,758
After mediation,
we won't have to see each other.

229
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:03,500
You should hire a lawyer,

230
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,787
and then we can just figure out
the custody.

231
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,907
I'll get going.

232
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,774
Hey. Hey...

233
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,991
Hey. Ji-won.

234
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:32,082
Hello.

235
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,596
Long time no see.

236
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,395
Please have a cup of tea.

237
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,668
I didn't know
I was hired through connections.

238
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:42,867
Did it upset you?

239
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,322
Of course I wasn't happy.

240
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,039
Come on.

241
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,733
I was a businessman once.

242
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:52,698
Just because someone asks for a favor,

243
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,230
doesn't mean I'll place people
wherever they want.

244
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:56,991
I wrote two stories last month

245
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:02,182
on people who were hired
by public enterprises through connections.

246
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,328
I was only giving you a chance
since you had potential.

247
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:08,333
- Really?
- Yes.

248
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:11,390
What did you like so much about me?

249
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,875
Isn't it a dream
of every political journalist

250
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,963
to be able to enter the Blue House?

251
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,435
My dream isn't to become the Seoul mayor.
It's beyond that.

252
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:28,742
I could've sent someone else,

253
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:31,243
but since it's the first time,
I wanted to talk to you face to face.

254
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,024
What is this?

255
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,787
A gift.

256
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,728
It's a little gift from me.

257
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,615
It's a real estate registry.

258
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:56,719
Whose is it?

259
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,840
It belongs to Candidate Lee Jung-il
from the opposition party,

260
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,316
who's marketing himself
as someone ordinary.

261
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,036
He's not ordinary.

262
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,917
It's an exclusive, and it's big too.

263
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:10,076
This...

264
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,491
What is it?

265
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:17,279
It's common for reporters
to get scoops over drinks

266
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:20,119
with the aides of the National Assembly,

267
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,429
but having you do this to me directly
really makes me uncomfortable.

268
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:27,692
Wait.

269
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:32,684
You're a contrarian.

270
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,309
Right?

271
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,662
Thanks for the compliment.

272
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:46,756
Right. I like that.

273
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,027
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

274
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,170
Leave it here.

275
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:57,032
It'll be released as an exclusive
from Bokuk anyway.

276
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,426
But Ji-won,

277
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,023
you can't last long

278
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:07,322
if you work like that.

279
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:11,805
Nothing is as pathetic

280
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,547
as someone who is incompetent but proud.

281
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:18,813
In this line of work,
snatching the opportunity

282
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,658
is being competent.

283
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,147
Just like Anna.

284
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:33,348
What kind of opportunity did she snatch?

285
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,114
She married me.

286
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,756
Right.

287
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,556
"Right."

288
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:49,962
"Right."

289
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,871
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

290
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,617
NOTHING CAN BE AS EMPTY AS THE COURAGE
OF THE WEAK - JUNG DO-JEON

291
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,895
Scholar Jung Do-jeon said this once.

292
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:02,582
"Nothing can be as empty
as the courage of the weak."

293
00:22:04,026 --> 00:22:07,861
"If you want to change the world,
become powerful first."

294
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:14,168
"If the world could change just from
a fuss from someone like you,

295
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,326
they wouldn't call this anarchy."

296
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,549
Do you want me to write it down?

297
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,600
Darn it. He's so annoying.

298
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,284
I'll take this.

299
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:20,660
This.

300
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,052
This too.

301
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:44,120
I want this one couriered in the morning
two days from now,

302
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,072
but send us the one
that was made on that day.

303
00:23:46,155 --> 00:23:47,083
Yes, Ma'am.

304
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,108
- Can I add a message?
- Yes.

305
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:10,326
- He's here.
- He's here.

306
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,491
Excuse me, please make way.

307
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:17,665
Please make way.

308
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,228
Could you say a few words
before the election?

309
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:26,257
Please comment.

310
00:24:29,242 --> 00:24:31,580
Please say a few words.

311
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:35,520
Can you please comment?

312
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,421
Passing through.

313
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:51,764
Please make way.

314
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:52,913
Could you comment?

315
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,143
Candidate Choi,
we hope to hear good news today.

316
00:25:01,226 --> 00:25:02,875
Yes. Thank you.

317
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,499
Candidate Choi. It's only the beginning.

318
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:06,516
Yes, I know.

319
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,819
Don't worry and just charge forward.

320
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:09,007
Yes, Sir.

321
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,704
Did you have a good dream last night?

322
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,507
My wife had a good dream.

323
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,938
Really?

324
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,977
All right. Choi Ji-hoon!

325
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,114
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

326
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:28,833
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

327
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:33,304
I'll be back.

328
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,451
With 3,216 votes,

329
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:44,400
making it 68.4 percent in favor,

330
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:47,953
Choi Ji-hoon was elected as the candidate
to represent

331
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:49,968
the Democratic Republican Party
in the run for the Seoul mayor.

332
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,886
Electoral college,

333
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,872
please send him
your congratulatory applause.

334
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,391
Thank you for your hard work.

335
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:58,808
Thank you.

336
00:26:58,891 --> 00:26:59,959
Thank you.

337
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:04,351
Our proud candidate Choi Ji-hoon
was elected today,

338
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:08,933
and he'll repay you all
with an overwhelming victory.

339
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,570
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

340
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:22,660
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

341
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:27,691
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

342
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:32,322
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

343
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,779
Wow. I expected it,

344
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,697
but I didn't think he'd win by this much.

345
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,557
He even beat the one
who was elected four times.

346
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,765
Everything's rigged anyway.

347
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:19,988
A reasonable suspicion.

348
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,356
Where do you think the story

349
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:24,025
about the exceptional admission
for Assemblyman Min's son came from?

350
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:25,827
I'm so curious.

351
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,913
You never cease to be curious.

352
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,668
Meeting him gave me a hunch.

353
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,434
Choi Ji-hoon is probably a jackpot
if we dig into him.

354
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,899
Don't even joke about that.

355
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,674
Dig into who?

356
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:41,345
You'll get in trouble before you do that.

357
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,421
You're so fearless.

358
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:47,637
I worry about you.

359
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,621
Have a drink.

360
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,226
Oh! You're here.

361
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:05,776
He's here.

362
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:08,627
- Choi Ji-hoon!
- Is the best!

363
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,282
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

364
00:29:14,306 --> 00:29:19,878
Choi Ji-hoon! Choi Ji-hoon!

365
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:29,821
Professor Lee is here.

366
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,049
Lee Anna!

367
00:29:37,132 --> 00:29:39,775
- Lee Anna!
- Is the best!

368
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:42,482
- Lee Anna!
- Is the best!

369
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:45,143
- Lee Anna!
- Is the best!

370
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:16,267
Darling, don't worry about a thing

371
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:28,491
Congratulations, Professor Lee.

372
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,865
If he gets out late,

373
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,206
just have him sleep in a hotel nearby.

374
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:40,824
Yes, Ma'am. I'll let you know.

375
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,775
No. Just let him sleep out.

376
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:45,287
Yes, Ma'am.

377
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:50,502
But if he wants to come home,
I'll contact you.

378
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,343
When do you sleep, Ms. Cho?

379
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,864
Well, today's a special day.

380
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:13,889
You had a long day.

381
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,014
Please rest.

382
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:52,906
The door's opening.

383
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:58,072
Basement level one

384
00:31:58,155 --> 00:31:59,669
The door's closing.

385
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,676
Going down.

386
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:27,357
The door's opening.

387
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,126
Basement level one

388
00:32:33,554 --> 00:32:35,107
The door's closing.

389
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:42,212
What has passed

390
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:45,741
Is passed

391
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,857
That in itself is meaningful

392
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,682
Choi Ji-hoon!

393
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:56,114
Let us

394
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:59,616
Sing together

395
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:04,567
Say that you dreamed without regrets

396
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,105
A cat?

397
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:40,329
Yes. Kids these days love cats.

398
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:43,273
You should keep one at our campaign camp.

399
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:46,052
The public will make up their own story

400
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:49,518
and they'll give it a title too.

401
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,657
To the cat?

402
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,675
It actually works really well.

403
00:33:53,758 --> 00:33:55,464
It can make you feel friendlier.

404
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:59,641
Then go ahead with it
as long as it doesn't get in the way.

405
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:00,674
Yes, Sir.

406
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,487
What should we name the cat?

407
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,864
Is that necessary?

408
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,243
If you can just give us a name,

409
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:10,345
the PR office will post the news

410
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:12,653
about rescuing a stray cat
on social media.

411
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,546
Was it really rescued?

412
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:18,337
- No.
- No, Sir.

413
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:27,665
Seoul. Seoul.

414
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,644
Seoul.

415
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,563
Seoul, Seoul, Seoul.

416
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,986
Seoul?

417
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:40,773
Seo Woo-ri?

418
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:45,103
- "Seo Woo-ri"?
- It's Seoul. Seo Woo-ri.

419
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:46,789
- The name?
- Seo Woo-ri.

420
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:49,246
Seo Woo-ri. Call it Seo Woo-ri.

421
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,061
Post it as Woo-ri, and when they ask why,

422
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:53,959
you can say its full name is Seo Woo-ri.

423
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,575
- Post it as Woo-ri at first.
- Understood.

424
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,824
- Woo-ri.
- That's marvelous.

425
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,357
Woo-ri. It's Woo-ri.

426
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,234
All right.

427
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,812
Then we'll have you take a picture
with the cat later.

428
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,618
- Is my hair okay?
- Pardon?

429
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:12,842
Well...

430
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:14,508
Mirror.

431
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,308
Redo this.

432
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:32,942
We mistook you, Professor Lee.

433
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,921
We didn't know you were so friendly.

434
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:38,050
I can understand.

435
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,787
I should've paid everyone a visit first.

436
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,542
No, not at all.

437
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,412
There is no need to do that
just because you're younger.

438
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:49,827
Actually, my daughter
is attending high school in Canada,

439
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,223
but I want her to attend
an American university.

440
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,878
I have a lot of questions.

441
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:54,894
Sure.

442
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:56,171
Please give me some advice.

443
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:58,152
Of course.

444
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:02,016
Gosh, look at the time.

445
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:05,442
You can go first.

446
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:07,740
I have another meeting here after.

447
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,217
Then I better vacant this seat for you.

448
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:14,395
I better get going.
I have to pick up my other child.

449
00:36:15,688 --> 00:36:17,244
See you another time.

450
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:18,963
Congratulations on the election.

451
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,005
- Don't bother seeing me out.
- Okay.

452
00:36:37,514 --> 00:36:39,132
Why is it so easy?

453
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:46,453
Professor Lee.

454
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,199
Hello.

455
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:52,066
I'm not late, am I?

456
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,872
Not at all.

457
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:58,647
...471.4 billion won will be invested

458
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,867
on about 191,000
in the farming and fishing community...

459
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,281
Welcome.

460
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:06,991
Can I get something to help my digestion?

461
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,575
What's bothering you?

462
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:16,233
I ate more than usual.

463
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:18,284
Did you overeat? One moment, please.

464
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,673
A woman in her 30s who was pessimistic
about her circumstances

465
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:23,727
was found dead in her car this morning

466
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,610
in Pyeongchang-dong.

467
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,140
Police say she lit up a charcoal briquette
and lost consciousness

468
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:32,254
- before a paperboy discovered her.
- It's 3,500 won.

469
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:35,222
She was transferred to a hospital,

470
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:38,255
but it was after
she had already passed away.

471
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,464
It's speculated
that Ms. Lee took an extreme measure

472
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:43,129
due to the recent stock market crash
and her marriage problems.

473
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:44,647
Are you

474
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,561
Professor Lee Anna by any chance?

475
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,548
I am.

476
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:53,413
It's such an honor to have you here.

477
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:56,836
Could I take a picture with you?

478
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:42,960
The door's opening.

479
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:53,378
A WOMAN IN HER 30S
PRESUMED TO HAVE TAKEN HER OWN LIFE

480
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:56,415
LEE, A WOMAN IN HER 30S
WAS FOUND DEAD THIS MORNING

481
00:38:56,498 --> 00:38:57,682
AT A PARKING LOT IN PYEONGCHANG-DONG

482
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,019
You know I'm impatient, right?

483
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,980
Make sure you meet the deadline.

484
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:13,731
Right, Yu-mi!

485
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,666
Stay out of my sight
and use the stairs, will you?

486
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,185
It can't be a suicide.

487
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:37,345
Yale University's yearbook?

488
00:39:37,428 --> 00:39:38,980
You can buy things like that these days.

489
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:41,631
Where?

490
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,859
They have websites in America
that sell used goods too.

491
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,326
You're right.

492
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,217
Why didn't I think of that?

493
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,008
People sell anything
that can make money nowadays.

494
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:52,784
No way.

495
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:54,702
You're a genius.

496
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,624
Darn it.

497
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:00,241
What is it? What are you looking for?

498
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,796
The truth.

499
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,488
Is this a 20 questions game?

500
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:09,373
Shall we eat faster?

501
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,026
I think I need to do some online shopping
back at the office.

502
00:40:30,396 --> 00:40:31,454
You're home.

503
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,295
Why didn't you show up without telling me?

504
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:56,006
I had a class.

505
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,933
I told you it's important.

506
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,547
I only sit there quietly like a flower.

507
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:07,236
Missing out a couple of times
won't deter anything.

508
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,603
I know you didn't have class.

509
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:13,733
You made me cancel a class last time

510
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,077
when you held an event at the museum.

511
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,380
This was the make-up class.

512
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,135
Didn't your loyal secretary tell you?

513
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,337
No, no. That's not the issue.

514
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:29,533
Your attitude is the problem.

515
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,185
What's with you?

516
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,569
You're saying the same thing you said

517
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,499
when you fired your driver, Mr. Kim.

518
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:49,520
Do I work under you?

519
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,952
Make-up class?

520
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:07,699
You should quit teaching.

521
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:09,505
I said, do I work under you?

522
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:15,791
I'll have Yu-mi accompany you
starting tomorrow, so go around with her.

523
00:42:21,421 --> 00:42:24,307
Is she accompanying me
or is she monitoring me?

524
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,962
So you are treating me like Mr. Kim.

525
00:42:48,408 --> 00:42:51,709
One day, these students

526
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,713
will become members of our society,

527
00:42:55,694 --> 00:42:59,552
and in turn, they'll do their best

528
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:01,190
to make this world a better place.

529
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,881
The weather was cloudy for several days.

530
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:12,925
Today, the sky looks especially blue,

531
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,907
and the sunlight is blinding.

532
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:22,333
I left home this morning,
and on my way here,

533
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:28,959
I got teary for some reason

534
00:43:30,548 --> 00:43:32,521
and my heart was racing.

535
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,423
On such a beautiful day,

536
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:43,487
Nuri Scholarship Foundation

537
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,941
will mark its beginning

538
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,812
with all of you here in attendance today.

539
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:55,192
Thank you.

540
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,157
News about Candidate Lee Jung-il's house
under a borrowed name was published.
