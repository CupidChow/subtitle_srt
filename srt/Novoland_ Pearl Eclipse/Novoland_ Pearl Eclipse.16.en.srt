Who are you?

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
Dismount now!

27
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,520
This is Lord Qinghai.

28
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,600
Pay your respects!

29
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,399
Good evening, Lord Qinghai.

30
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,639
Rise.

31
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,080
Is General Tang in?

32
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:38,919
Yes.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,160
Please.

34
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,279
Lord...

35
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,279
I’m fine.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,880
Lord Qinghai,

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,559
General Tang has been informed

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,479
about your visit.

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,639
This way, please.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Good evening, Lord Qinghai.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,679
Lord Qinghai?

42
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,960
Brother’s Master?

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,559
Yes!

44
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,320
- That’s right.
- Help is here!

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

46
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,720
Rise, gentlemen.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,279
I apologize

48
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,880
for my abrupt visit this late.

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,360
Please.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,199
After the clear win

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,279
at Xiping Port,

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
I didn’t expect to see you

53
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,759
so quickly,

54
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
considering the distance

55
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,639
and mountains and waters in between.

56
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,240
Where are we on the battlefield?

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,320
When we were battling

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,119
Huku’s Left Tribe,

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,399
the Right Tribe exploited the chance

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,720
and occupied Lanzi in Jiaman.

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Neither of them has launched attacks

62
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,960
against us, though,

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,320
since the Left Tribe was beaten back,

64
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
but Staff Officer Fang

65
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,320
is trapped in Lanzi

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,320
to rescue local refugees.

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,520
I’ve sent

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,520
Commander Zhang

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
to pull him out.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
So far, we’ve got no sign of them

71
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,559
or proof of life or death.

72
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,800
Show me Lanzi.

73
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,039
This is Huangquan Pass.

74
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,520
(Mount Piluo)
Here’s Mount Piluo.

75
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,880
(Red Plain)
Go over Red Plain

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
(Lanzi)
and you’ll see Lanzi.

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
There’s a garrison of 10,000 troops.

78
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,119
I’ve considered

79
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,839
sending in a small squad there

80
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,000
to get them out,

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,600
but that’d be a long shot.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,279
And if our main troops

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
were to carry out a raid,

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the Pass would be left unguarded.

85
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,359
The Left Tribe

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
has gone off the grid

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,239
since the defeat.

88
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,200
I don’t want to risk being ambushed

89
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,119
for a rescue attempt.

90
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,440
That makes sense.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
Now isn’t a good time

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,440
for another fight
when the last one barely ended,

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,119
nor should anyone

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,040
put personal safety

95
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,519
before regional security.

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
But Staff Officer Fang...

97
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,519
The state shall come first.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,079
The rescue operation

99
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,839
can wait.

100
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,359
Yes.

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
(Lanzi)

102
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,920
(West of Lanzi)

103
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,160
Lord.

104
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,119
Come in.

105
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,799
We’ve got something, Lord.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,519
Lord,

107
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,519
Fang Haishi asked me to tell you

108
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,079
the West Gate of Lanzi

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,239
is the weakest point of attack.

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,200
He’s still inside the Governor’s Mansion

111
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,720
waiting for backup from the outside.

112
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,559
I see. You may leave.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,600
Lord,

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,440
you came a long way. It’s time to eat.

115
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,559
Leave the food on the table.

116
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,040
Lord,

117
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:53,839
it’s late.

118
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,200
You should get some rest.

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,519
I will

120
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,640
after my work is done.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,799
You can go.

122
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes.

123
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,119
Lord traveled day and night

124
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,040
despite the reopening of his wound.

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Now that he has arrived,

126
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,839
some proper rest is necessary.

127
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,839
He even asked us

128
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,239
to keep his condition from everyone,

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,839
including army physicians.

130
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,559
I’m truly worried about him.

131
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,920
I saw his sword

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,720
on the map on his table.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,839
With Young Master Haishi

134
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,119
stuck in Lanzi,

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,320
Lord must be

136
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,720
worried sick

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,160
but he can’t show any of that.

138
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Lord is too noble

139
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,679
to give up the big picture.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
I’m afraid

141
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,079
he’ll come up with something unusual

142
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,679
that will put himself in danger.

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,640
Relax.

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
He can always

145
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
get things done.

146
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,880
Let’s do our part

147
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,519
to share his burden.

148
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,079
Aren’t you going in?

149
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,239
Go ahead!

150
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,959
After you.

151
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,519
I... I...

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,679
Get in there.

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,799
You first.

154
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,480
What’s wrong with you?

155
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,799
Lord Qinghai is Brother’s Master.

156
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,559
He won’t bite.

157
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,399
Stop

158
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,440
dragging your feet

159
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,959
if you want Brother back!

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,839
Just go!

161
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,839
Who are you?

162
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:25,880
I...

163
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,559
I, Ren Yong,

164
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,920
request to see Lord Qinghai.

165
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,640
We request to see Lord Qinghai.

166
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,480
Come in.

167
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,279
- Lord Qinghai!
- Lord Qinghai!

168
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,040
- Please help Brother!
- Please help Brother!

169
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,799
- I...
- Lord Qinghai,

170
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,600
Salia asks to see you.

171
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
Lord Qinghai,

172
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,760
Salia is the leader of the Jiamanese.

173
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,279
She was the one

174
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,160
who helped

175
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,119
get the message out

176
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,200
from Lanzi.

177
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,079
Send her in.

178
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,359
Yes.

179
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,800
(Huangquan Battalion)

180
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Lord Qinghai is expecting you.

181
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,119
You four, stay here.

182
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

183
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:29,359
Greetings, Lord Qinghai. I’m Salia,

184
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,559
leader of the Jiamanese.

185
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,119
Can I help you with anything?

186
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,239
Yes.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Your troops

188
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,320
can’t get Mr. Fang out

189
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
but the Jiamanese can.

190
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,679
You...

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,719
Lanzi

192
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,239
was our home.

193
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,320
My father was the governor

194
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,719
who was killed by the Huku people

195
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
along with

196
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,039
my mother and elder brother.

197
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,359
Thanks to Mr. Fang’s timely heads-up

198
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,559
about the occupation,

199
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,719
the rest of our tribesmen

200
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,559
survived

201
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,960
Huku’s massacre.

202
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,719
We’re in his debt

203
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,479
for helping us more than once.

204
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,599
When we lost Lanzi to Huku,

205
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,799
I vowed to get it back

206
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,159
at all costs.

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The Jiamanese would rather die

208
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,640
than surrender.

209
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,719
We can help

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,239
both in and outside the city

211
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,359
and work with your people.

212
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,440
It’s worth a shot.

213
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,679
Since you are

214
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,640
Mr. Fang’s Master,

215
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,119
we expect you to lead

216
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,679
and help us regain our homeland

217
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,919
and get Mr. Fang out.

218
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,919
Lord Qinghai,

219
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,239
we’ll do anything we can

220
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,280
to rescue Brother!

221
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,880
What’s this?

222
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,599
Your men at Huangquan Pass

223
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,159
are demoralized

224
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,919
and sending you to throw in the towel?

225
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,440
Not exactly, Lord of Right Pudun.

226
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,440
Our force

227
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,359
back there

228
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,119
is 10 times larger than yours in Lanzi,

229
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,479
not to mention

230
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,200
the vast territory of Dazheng behind us.

231
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,640
Why would we throw in the towel?

232
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,440
Didn’t Lord of Left Pudun

233
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
almost wipe you out earlier?

234
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,760
Hadn’t it been for Qilin Battalion,

235
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,960
you would’ve lost the Pass.

236
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,159
A battlewise strategist like you

237
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,559
must be aware of luring the enemies in.

238
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,320
It’s true

239
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,000
that we seem

240
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,719
to have suffered heavy losses

241
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,159
but the Left Tribe

242
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,320
lost their leader during the fight.

243
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,159
Isn’t it obvious

244
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,359
who paid a bigger price?

245
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,119
You sure can talk.

246
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,239
If you aren’t here

247
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,039
to beg for a peace talk,

248
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,400
why bother sending an envoy?

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,960
Dazheng is

250
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,200
a nation of etiquette.

251
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,599
Learning that

252
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,479
you were having a new wife,

253
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
our general asked me

254
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,640
to bring you wedding gifts.

255
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,320
So that you could get in touch

256
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,559
with the captives

257
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,159
and ambush us from both sides?

258
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,919
I thought Lord of Right Pudun

259
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,239
was brave.

260
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,919
Turns out,

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
you’re timid and overcautious.

262
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,440
If you are

263
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,840
so intimidated by us,

264
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,280
I’ll leave with the gifts.

265
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:06,599
Good day.

266
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,719
Hold on!

267
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,200
Is there anything else?

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,679
I accept your gifts.

269
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
Go back and tell Fang Jianming

270
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,080
that he’ll pay

271
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,799
for the shameful defeat at Red Plain.

272
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,559
I’ll see him soon on the battlefield.

273
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,679
Keep an eye on him

274
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,520
in case of any trap.

275
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,559
Yes.

276
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:37,559
Lord,

277
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,719
what about the gifts?

278
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,679
Check them now

279
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
for suspicious items.

280
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,080
Lord,

281
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,520
they’ve already

282
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,840
been checked.

283
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,119
No secret letters or signs are found,

284
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,359
only congratulatory gifts.

285
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,919
If so,

286
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,440
take them to the attic

287
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:55,719
to my Davana

288
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,880
as a message

289
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,840
that I’m not afraid of Dazheng

290
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,679
or anything from them

291
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,239
to her.

292
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Bloodstain!

293
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,719
Was Master injured?

294
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,080
Master,

295
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,080
are you at Huangquan Battalion?

296
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,359
He can’t be

297
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,039
telling me that alone.

298
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,119
These are

299
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,640
necessities for the Xiayuan Festival.

300
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,080
Is he going to make a move

301
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,919
on that day?

302
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,760
Lord of Right Pudun

303
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,679
only said that

304
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
and let me out.

305
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,320
I left

306
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,359
without

307
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,119
doing anything else

308
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,679
as you asked

309
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,599
and came

310
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,400
straight back

311
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,280
with the entourages.

312
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,719
Lord,

313
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,479
can you fill me in now?

314
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,679
The delivery is a success.

315
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,799
Thank you for your work.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Now, go back and rest.

317
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,440
Yes.

318
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,760
Nice victory!

319
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,400
Still,

320
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:19,960
that’s not enough

321
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,239
to make up for his fault.

322
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,599
After winning at Xiping Port,

323
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,799
he ignored the chain of command,

324
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
without reporting to me

325
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,479
immediately

326
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
and left for Huangquan Pass!

327
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,559
That was intolerable!

328
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,320
Why?

329
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,239
Was I wrong?

330
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,679
No, Your Majesty.

331
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,359
All that was true.

332
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,599
But Master

333
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,479
would never overstep his authority.

334
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,200
He went there alone

335
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,400
for a reason.

336
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,640
Huangquan Battalion

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,719
has beaten back the Left Tribe of Huku

338
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,239
and killed Lord of Left Pudun.

339
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
We’re taking control of the situation.

340
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,280
If anything happened,

341
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,359
there’d be urgent reports

342
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,000
coming in.

343
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,359
But now, I’m hearing nothing at all.

344
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:02,599
What brought him over there?

345
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:03,799
Your Majesty,

346
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,919
the communication channel

347
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,200
was still under repair earlier.

348
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,640
Master made the trip

349
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,000
without the others

350
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:12,960
to gather information
as soon as possible.

351
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,719
Don’t try to fool me.

352
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,320
If Fang Jianming

353
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,359
had to rush to the border

354
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,840
to do that himself,

355
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,039
then

356
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,359
what did I

357
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,479
pay those men under him for?

358
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I bet

359
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,840
he traveled half a state

360
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,880
for his disciple, Fang Haishi, again.

361
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,559
What now?

362
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,479
You can’t argue there, can you?

363
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,559
He’s more than capable

364
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,479
but also soft-hearted sometimes.

365
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,760
That’s bad.

366
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,039
Don’t be like him.

367
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,399
(Part)

368
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,559
“Flowered forehead is from last night.

369
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,039
Behind the screen window
she smiles brightly.

370
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,159
We first met when peonies bloomed.

371
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,200
Yet we had to part too soon.”

372
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,440
Your Highness,

373
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,840
is it done?

374
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,320
Yes.

375
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,559
It’s going up!

376
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,840
Look.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,400
It can go even higher!

378
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,840
(Fabric Office)
- Higher! - Go!

379
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:29,679
Go, go, go!

380
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,440
This way.

381
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,400
Give me the string. Let me do it.

382
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,400
Watch it!

383
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,840
Don’t get the strings tangled.

384
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,879
♪Fallen flowers were streaming down♪

385
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,960

00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,079
Zheliu,

391
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,640
come and fly kites with us!

392
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:49,239
Higher!

393
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,439
Keep going!

394
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
It’s high enough.

395
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,800
Bizi,

396
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,199
hand me a pair of scissors.

397
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,119
Your Highness,

398
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,359
it can go higher.

399
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,439
If it goes south,

400
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,959
will it be out of the South Corner Gate?

401
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,640
The South Corner Lane,

402
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,319
South Corner Gate, palace wall,

403
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:09,599
Yu River and the South Market.

404
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,800
Look!

405
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,640
Your Highness.

406
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,079
I’m letting you out.

407
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,359
That way,

408
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
you won’t be held back

409
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,760
by this string again.

410
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,400
You’re free now.

411
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,400
Your Highness,

412
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,719
why did you cut it loose?

413
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,880
Let it fly.

414
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,319
Give me. Give me that.

415
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,040
Go right.

416
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,079
Easy! Or the string will snap.

417
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,439
Let’s see

418
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,479
whose kite is the highest, okay?

419
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,319
- Great!
- I’m in!

420
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,199
All right.

421
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,479
It’s going.

422
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,199
Do it.

423
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,439
It’s so high!

424
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
Mine is the highest!

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,520
Look!

426
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,719
Take this.

427
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,079
What’s wrong? Why are you crying?

428
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,079
Zheliu,

429
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,760
my...

430
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,560
my kite flew away.

431
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,119
There, there.

432
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,119
Where did it go?

433
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,599
The Garden, I think.

434
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,800
Come. Let’s go find it.

435
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,719
You’ll get it back.

436
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,359
Let’s go.

437
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
What time is it?

438
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,959
Your Majesty,

439
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,719
it’s almost dark.

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
Halt! Halt! Halt!

441
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,400
Whose kite is this?

442
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,920
I’m sorry, Your Majesty.

443
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:57,800
Well...

444
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,760
Uh...

445
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,680
It’s windy lately.

446
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,239
Some unruly maid

447
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,479
must’ve flown it away

448
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,959
- and hit you. I...
- “Flowered forehead is from last night.

449
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,319
Behind the screen window
she smiles brightly.

450
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,199
We first met when peonies bloomed.

451
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,839
- Yet we had to part too soon.”
- Have you seen it?

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
No.

453
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,079
You again!

454
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

455
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,920
Zheliu pays respects to Your Majesty.

456
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,520
Whose kite is this?

457
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
You flew it without permission

458
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
and it hit His Majesty.

459
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,119
Who flew that kite away?

460
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,239
Say it now.

461
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,479
If you don’t,

462
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,239
the Inner Prison

463
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
will be waiting for you.

464
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,040
Your Majesty,

465
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,119
I lost control of that kite.

466
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,959
Please forgive me.

467
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:13,880
You...

468
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,599
Could you give this kite to me?

469
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,640
Yes... Of course, Your Majesty.

470
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:25,800
Reward her.

471
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,520
Yes.

472
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,400
Let’s go.

473
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes.

474
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,599
Up.

475
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:58,480
(Lanzi)

476
00:21:59,119 --> 00:21:59,839
Slaves

477
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,800
are flooding in

478
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,560
this early.

479
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,160
It’s probably too cold outside.

480
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,479
- I bet.
- Perfect.

481
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,959
The army could use extra hands.

482
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
They could stir up trouble, too.

483
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,359
Nice physique.

484
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,599
We could use him

485
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,560
to work

486
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,359
as an army mule.

487
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,479
There are more over there.

488
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:49,920
We only need the strong ones.

489
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,920
The old and young

490
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,880
would eat more than they could work.

491
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,239
Move!

492
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,599
Move it!

493
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
You dirty slave

494
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,520
showed up in front of the prison
early this morning.

495
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,640
Move!

496
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
Did you know there was food inside?

497
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,199
Hurry up! Keep moving!

498
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,680
Or I’ll kill you!

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,520
Go!

500
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,599
- Keep up! Move!
- Move it!

501
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,239
They’re a bunch of pigs

502
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,199
who’d do anything

503
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,479
for a bite.

504
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,719
They can’t be in the same cell!

505
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:22,800
You three,

506
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:23,439
come here!

507
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,079
You two,

508
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:24,800
over here!

509
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,439
Move!

510
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:26,479
Go!

511
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,359
Move!

512
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Move it!

513
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:29,359
Get in!

514
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,640
Lord Qinghai of Dazheng

515
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,520
asked us, the Jiamanese, to find you.

516
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,959
I’ve reached out

517
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,160
to almost everyone in the prison,

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,520
awaiting Lord’s order.

519
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,880
Lord Qinghai said

520
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:14,920
we’d break the blockade

521
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,239
from both sides

522
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
during the Xiayuan Festival

523
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,319
to get everyone out.

524
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,400
I’ve given you everything

525
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,520
you asked.

526
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,239
When will you give me what I want?

527
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,000
I’m running

528
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,239
out of patience.

529
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,000
Don’t push me.

530
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,079
I can either free those prisoners

531
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,400
or kill them.

532
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,280
You’ve held your end of the bargain

533
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,599
and so will I,

534
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,079
providing

535
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,280
that you confer the title

536
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,040
of Davana on me.

537
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,760
Do you know what you’re asking for?

538
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,760
Absolutely.

539
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,479
I remember

540
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,800
you threatened to

541
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,839
kill yourself more than once

542
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,400
to not be with me.

543
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,560
How come you changed your mind

544
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,079
soon after Dazheng’s envoy showed up?

545
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,959
We have a saying back home

546
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,280
that a smart one should choose wisely.

547
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,239
Lord,

548
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,199
if you can get rid of Fang Jianming

549
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,800
and take over Huangquan Pass,

550
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:20,680
it’ll only be a matter of time

551
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,160
before your tribe
dominates the grassland.

552
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,319
Then as your Davana,

553
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,479
I’ll be the queen of it.

554
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,880
Turning you down would get me killed.

555
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,640
Even if I survived,

556
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,479
I could never go back again.

557
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,119
But marrying me

558
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
will also

559
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,839
keep you away from home.

560
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,560
Don’t you miss your family and friends?

561
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,160
I’m an orphan.

562
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,560
If I weren’t,

563
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,199
I wouldn’t have

564
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,680
ended up at Huangquan Pass

565
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,119
and joined the army as a girl.

566
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,599
I was dressing up
as a man the whole time.

567
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,040
I figured no one in the battalion

568
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,839
would see through my disguise.

569
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,079
After thinking long and hard

570
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,560
over the past few days,

571
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,880
I believe only someone at Huangquan Pass

572
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,479
could tip you off

573
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,959
about my cover.

574
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,239
An insider.

575
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,760
In that case,

576
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,760
I could never go back there.

577
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,119
No one

578
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,800
would choose death over life,

579
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,160
and wealth

580
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,839
over poverty.

581
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,119
No wonder I couldn’t find

582
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,079
the source of information.

583
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
You’ve shown me nothing but sincerity.

584
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,160
I’m willing to be your Davana

585
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,719
and help you level Huangquan Pass

586
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,199
for the greater good.

587
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Do you mean that?

588
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,959
You can trust me.

589
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,520
But before that,

590
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,800
I demand a grand wedding

591
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
enough for everyone in and out of

592
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,560
Huangquan Pass

593
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,359
knows that I, Tidi,

594
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,800
am not less than anyone!

595
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,800
No problem.

596
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
As long as you agree to marry me,

597
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,800
I promise

598
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,359
even eagles in the air

599
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,800
will envy your ceremony.

600
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,040
When will we have our big day?

601
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,239
Lanzi is close to the border

602
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,319
and it’s chilled to the bone.

603
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:02,760
We can

604
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,439
head back to the capital next spring

605
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,400
and get married.

606
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,079
Next spring?

607
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,439
That’s too late.

608
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,199
According to Dazheng’s calendar,

609
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
today is October 15th,
the Xiayuan Festival,

610
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
perfect for marriage.

611
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,199
If you do love me,

612
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,520
let’s get married today.

613
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:22,079
Are you sure?

614
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,599
We can have

615
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,160
a big wedding tonight.

616
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,520
That’d be great.

617
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
Will you

618
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,239
do me one last favor

619
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
before our big night?

620
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:32,400
What is it?

621
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,520
I’d like to visit those prisoners again.

622
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,439
What for?

623
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,319
We used to

624
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,719
go through

625
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,319
fire and water together.

626
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,359
I need a sense of closure.

627
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:45,319
I want to say goodbye to them

628
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,079
and tell them

629
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,280
I’m going to marry you

630
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,160
and be your wife.

631
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:52,880
Sure.

632
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,160
If that’s what you want.

633
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,000
My lady! You’re here!

634
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,040
My lady!

635
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:00,640
My lady!

636
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,560
My lady!

637
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,640
You’re here, my lady!

638
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,560
Great! Finally!

639
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,000
Tonight,

640
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,319
Lord of Right Pudun will confer

641
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,040
the title of Davana on me.

642
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,319
Give them food and liquor

643
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,119
so that they can celebrate

644
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,319
our big night.

645
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:19,719
Yes.

646
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,319
There’s food!

647
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes!

648
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,760
They are giving us food!

649
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,520
- Great!
- We can eat!

650
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,319
- We have food!
- Thank you!

651
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:27,959
Give me one!

652
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,959
- Give it to me!
- Give me!

653
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,599
- Give me that!
- I want food!

654
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,199
- Give it to me!
- Give me!

655
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:31,719
Don’t push!

656
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,880
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

657
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,199
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks.

658
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,800
Thank you so much.

659
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,400
There are chickpeas for all of you.

660
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,239
Fill yourselves up

661
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,359
and be war-horses on the grassland

662
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,800
under Lord’s command.

663
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,599
Later,

664
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,839
the big firework show

665
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,520
will be outside the Governor’s Mansion

666
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,119
when I

667
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,599
and Lord of Right Pudun get married.

668
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
- Let us go!
- My lady!

669
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,839
Free us, my lady!

670
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
My lady!

671
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,479
Release us, my lady!

672
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,239
Please let us go!

673
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,439
Free us!

674
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,640
Please!

675
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Send the message to Lord Qinghai.

676
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:18,760
What are you doing?

677
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:19,800
You can’t wait to die?

678
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,400
The whistle

679
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
is the Jiamanese way to celebrate.

680
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,560
Please forgive me.

681
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,000
I meant to

682
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,119
give Lord and Her Ladyship my blessing.

683
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,599
Make it louder

684
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,560
so that

685
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,680
they can hear you.

686
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Move in tonight.

687
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,280
Fireworks are the signal.

688
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:44,760
Inform those outside.

689
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,160
Move in tonight.

690
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,160
Fireworks are the signal.

691
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,319
Inform those outside.

692
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,119
Move in tonight.

693
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,520
Fireworks are the signal.

694
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,839
Inform those outside.

695
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,560
Officer,

696
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:12,640
my kid is thirsty.

697
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,040
Please give us some water!

698
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:14,680
Go away!

699
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,719
There’s no water

700
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,319
for slaves!

701
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:16,800
Get lost!

702
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:21,040
Come here.

703
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,319
Are you all right?

704
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:22,920
I’m fine.

705
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,479
Get up.

706
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,319
Let’s go.

707
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,719
Too bad,

708
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,000
we don’t have flowers in winter.

709
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:18,800
Lord,

710
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,959
we’re at a critical moment.

711
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,359
Aren’t you being too kind to Davana

712
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,079
by letting her visit those prisoners

713
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,599
and tell them about your wedding?

714
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,680
Don’t forget she’s a foreigner.

715
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:27,640
I mean...

716
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,119
Aren’t you afraid

717
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
she’d collude

718
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,680
with those captives

719
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,000
and...?

720
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,160
That visit

721
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,880
is the perfect test.

722
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,599
Lord,

723
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,719
I don’t follow.

724
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,760
If she’s against me,

725
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,280
she’ll get caught in there

726
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,800
which will also reveal

727
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,040
the mole inside.

728
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,479
But if she keeps her promise

729
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,400
and marries me,

730
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,760
I’m sure

731
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:54,839
her strength and wisdom

732
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,119
will assist me

733
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
in ruling over the grassland.

734
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,760
She’s been

735
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:01,920
the only woman in decades

736
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,520
who’s shot a tribe leader to death.

737
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
If Davana could kill Lord of Left Pudun,

738
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,560
she’d fight side by side with you

739
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
to flatten Hanzhou!

740
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,000
Lord,

741
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,599
Davana went to the prison

742
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,079
to bring them food and liquor

743
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,160
and gladly announced

744
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,359
your wedding before leaving.

745
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
All I heard was something about

746
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,439
fireworks and celebration.

747
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:23,359
She didn’t

748
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,479
talk to anyone

749
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,359
or go near

750
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:26,280
any cell.

751
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,560
That’s it?

752
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,359
Yes.

753
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,479
Good! That’s great!

754
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,280
In that case,

755
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,520
my Davana

756
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,199
is glad to be with me.

757
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,599
Lord,

758
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,800
new intelligence came in.

759
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:38,719
Let me see.

760
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,400
Fang Haishi is Fang Jianming’s lover

761
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,359
and his inside contact in Lanzi.

762
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,439
Lord...

763
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,479
Fang Haishi is Dazheng’s spy!

764
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,680
You,

765
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
follow me to seize her!

766
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,119
You,

767
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,520
go to the prison

768
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,719
and watch the captives closely.

769
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,439
Any sign of resistance

770
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,439
and they’re dead!

771
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,119
You,

772
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,560
call in more guards

773
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,359
and keep an eye on the Jiamanese!

774
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,239
You,

775
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
ask Luerdan

776
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,719
to come over immediately!

777
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,599
Yes!

778
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:24,439
Go!

779
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,160
Go!

780
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
As per Lord’s order,

781
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,680
keep the captives under close watch.

782
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,719
Any sign of resistance

783
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,359
and they’re dead!

784
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,359
Yes!

785
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Step back!

786
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:35,800
Back!

787
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,479
Step back!

788
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,280
Go back!

789
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:37,920
Don’t move!

790
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,479
Or

791
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,479
you’ll be executed!

792
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,439
Working with Fang Jianming to escape?

793
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,839
I’m so disappointed, Tidi.

794
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,439
Seize her!

795
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,280
Fang Jianming!

796
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,120
Go get them!

797
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:43,600
Are they beautiful?

798
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,719
They remind me of Jifeng Flowers.

799
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,919
Master,

800
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,159
were there similar fireworks

801
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,959
when you got married?

802
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:55,800
No.

803
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,399
I’d never marry someone I don’t love.

804
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,800
Mr. Zhang,

805
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,520
what now?

806
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,679
You guys head to the Governor’s Mansion.

807
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,520
The rest of you follow me

808
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,080
to open the gate.

809
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,120
- Yes!
- Yes!

810
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,800
Gather all our members

811
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,840
and kill Lord of Right Pudun

812
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
to avenge Governor’s murder!

813
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:18,959
Yes.

814
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,439
Let’s go.

815
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:20,439
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

816
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,040
- Come on!
- Let’s go!

817
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:21,879
Go!

818
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,159
Charge!

819
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,479
Charge, everyone!

820
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:00,919
Whoever beheads Fang Jianming

821
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,600
and captures Fang Haishi alive

822
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,199
will get 10,000 taels of gold!

823
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,000
Master,

824
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,040
what’s going on?

825
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,639
The Jiamanese knockout drugs
are kicking in.

826
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,320
- Lord!
- Lord!

827
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:10,919
Lord!

828
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,919
Master,

829
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,840
you’re bleeding!

830
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,479
I’m fine. Nothing serious.

831
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,199
Lord,

832
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,479
Mr. Fang.

833
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:37,840
Mr. Zhang,

834
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,840
you work for Jifeng Pavilion?

835
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,040
That’s right.

836
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:42,520
We’re on the same team.

837
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,520
Yes, Brother!

838
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,879
We’re here to get you out!

839
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,919
Bonehead!

840
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,800
Brother,

841
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,399
we’re here to fight with you!

842
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,560
Fang Haishi!

843
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:55,719
Let her go!

844
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
I will

845
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:04,840
if you take her place.

846
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:05,760
Don’t!

847
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,840
Do whatever you want to me!

848
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,840
Leave my disciple alone.

849
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:12,800
Your disciple?

850
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,159
You think I don’t know

851
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,199
what’s going on between you two?

852
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,840
I’ll do it!

853
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:23,479
Very well.

854
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:05,679
Master!

855
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:12,399
Mr. Fang!

856
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,280
- Brother!
- Brother!

857
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,320
Kill them all!

858
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,879
- Charge!
- Charge!

859
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,560
Move!

860
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:18,959
Let’s go!

861
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,159
Charge!

862
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,840
Charge!

863
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,679
Haishi!

864
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,919
Mr. Fang!

865
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,719
Haishi...

866
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,840
Go!

867
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,239
Get the best physician here!

868
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,080
Hang in there!

869
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,639
Guard the Governor’s Mansion.

870
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,719
No entry is allowed.

871
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:45,959
Stay here as lookouts.

872
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,280
Don’t get into the attic.

873
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,719
Yes.

874
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:48,360
Salia,

875
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,080
bring all the medicine inside.

876
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:50,679
Yes!

877
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,879
It’s going to hurt.

878
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,600
Be strong, will you?

879
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,199
The bleeding must stop.

880
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,639
Mr. Fang!

881
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
- Brother!
- Brother!

882
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,840
Brother!

883
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,239
Salia,

884
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,639
please go inside to look after him.

885
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,719
Sure.

886
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,800
How’s he, Lord Qinghai?

887
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,439
The wound is too deep.

888
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,399
What to do?

889
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,000
Lord Qinghai,

890
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,879
what can I do for you?

891
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,800
I need medicine to stop the bleeding,

892
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,199
some gauze and hot water.

893
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,120
Noted.

894
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,520
I’m on it.

895
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,800
Lord,

896
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,679
Earlji got wind

897
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:17,639
of our raid on Lanzi beforehand.

898
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,239
Our people

899
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:19,959
are responsible for

900
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,000
the intelligence network in Huku.

901
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,520
I’m afraid if the capital...

902
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,679
I know that.

903
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,639
End of discussion.

904
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:28,719
Yes.

905
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:29,840
Lord,

906
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:31,800
are you having concerns?

907
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,360
Things in the capital are complicated.

908
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,120
Focus on the matter at hand

909
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,239
and go from there.

910
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,239
The Left Tribe of Huku

911
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,679
attacked Well Town.

912
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,959
And the Right Tribe

913
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:42,679
was well aware of my whereabouts.

914
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,439
Go into the city tomorrow

915
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:45,520
and see if you can find any leads.

916
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,840
Lord,

917
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,800
your wound...

918
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:49,919
Don’t worry. Just go.

919
00:43:14,399 --> 00:43:15,040
How’s he?

920
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,360
Lord Qinghai, he...

921
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,439
Over a decade of compromise

922
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
only

923
00:44:12,879 --> 00:44:14,879
leads to endless pain.

924
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,840
Had you

925
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:19,280
anticipated this,

926
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,800
you would’ve regretted...

927
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,000
regretted

928
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:26,919
running into me in the first place.

929
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:39,479
Your Majesty,

930
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,320
is there any update

931
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,639
from Huangquan Pass?

932
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,320
We clobbered the Right Tribe of Huku

933
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,120
who fled back to Hanbei.

934
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,760
That’s good news, Your Majesty!

935
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,120
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

936
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:58,840
But our troops

937
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,159
weren’t alerted at all

938
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,239
before multiple attacks.

939
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,399
Luckily,

940
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:05,199
a spy we caught

941
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,360
under deep cover in Lanzi

942
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,719
revealed that

943
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,600
someone was keeping us in the dark.

944
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,000
That’s...

945
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,040
Any ideas, Mr. Su?

946
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,959
Your Majesty,

947
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,159
I don’t know much about that.

948
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:26,479
But in my opinion,

949
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,280
a spy

950
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,760
could very well lie.

951
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,719
With the border unstable,

952
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,159
we can’t afford

953
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,120
to wrong our warriors

954
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,040
out there

955
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,159
based on one man’s story.

956
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,959
Fair point, Mr. Su.

957
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,719
We’ll know better

958
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:46,959
once he’s brought back to the capital

959
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,959
and undergoes intensive interrogation.

960
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,600
That spy

961
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,959
is coming to Tianqi?

962
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,320
Lord Qinghai is always discreet.

963
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,000
He kept the arrest

964
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,879
of the spy quiet

965
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,080
and sent him

966
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,399
from Lanzi to the capital.

967
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,000
He’s on the way as we speak.

968
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,479
Unfortunately,

969
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,120
he’s badly injured

970
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:10,600
and unconscious.

971
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,360
Mr. Su, I trust you.

972
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:16,760
Have your people

973
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,239
go and bring him back.

974
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,879
Yes, Your Majesty.

975
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,520
That’s it. It’s getting dark.

976
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,399
You may leave.

977
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,320
