These things

27
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,000
will be used on the wedding day.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Be very careful.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,241
Haishi.

30
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,960
You’re back at last.

31
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:28,399
The wedding things arrived before you.

32
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,399
It took us quite a lot of time

33
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,360
to put them away.

34
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,176
Today, Youdu helped me a lot.

35
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:33,440
I invited him to have a drink.

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,559
Thank you, Zhuoying.

37
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,400
Youdu is so nice to you. Here.

38
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:37,425
It’s for you.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,721
What’s this?

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,725
It was sent with the wedding things.

41
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,700
Youdu gave it to you.

42
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,839
It’s such a good ring.

43
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,000
I guess he knows
you’re good at horsemanship and archery,

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,639
so he picked this for you.

45
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,000
I don’t accept a gift without a reason.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,559
This is much too expensive.

47
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,839
I’ll return it to him.

48
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,880
Haishi,

49
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,199
he had the gift sent to you

50
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,520
from far away.

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,919
Are you really going to return it?

52
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,575
Master.

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,010
Master, you’re getting married soon.

54
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,600
I’ve prepared

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,275
a small gift for you.

56
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,240
Now that you want to stay alone,

57
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,065
I’ll leave you alone.

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,075
Why do you

59
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,554
push Fang Haishi so hard?

60
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,500
Why must you ask him

61
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,220
to rush back to Huangquan Pass now?

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
His secondment is due.

63
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:34,695
Please approve, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
But now,

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,279
Tianqi City is in need of personnel.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,079
I don’t approve.

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,359
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:43,799
He’s your apprentice.

69
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,160
He’s been taking care

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,359
of your wedding.

71
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,975
I don’t understand.

72
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,320
Why must you ask him

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
to return to Huangquan Pass now?

74
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,040
Greetings, Your Majesty.

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,839
Mudan,

76
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,250
you’re just in time.

77
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,079
Be seated.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Tell me.

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,275
Is it appropriate

80
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:14,279
to transfer Fang Haishi
back to Huangquan Pass?

81
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,480
What?

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Mr. Fang Haishi is leaving?

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,880
He works steadily

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,440
and is very trustworthy.

85
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:21,799
I wanted to keep him

86
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,725
so that he can help me for a bit longer.

87
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,436
Is there a war at Huangquan Battalion?

88
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,959
Ask him.

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,519
The world is in peace now.

90
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,160
Must he go back there?

91
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,279
Mudan,

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,920
today, you came earlier

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
than you usually did.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
Is there a reason?

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,679
Brother Xu,

96
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,079
I’m getting married soon.

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,761
But a lot of things
haven’t been decided yet.

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,359
Jianming,

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,640
you’re not doing a good job

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,959
as her future husband.

101
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,760
Mudan is complaining

102
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
because you haven’t spent much time

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,119
accompanying her.

104
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,839
The scenery is good here.

105
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,359
You and Mudan

106
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,250
can stay and discuss your wedding.

107
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,689
Yes, Your Majesty.

108
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:27,920
Lord,

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,720
Haishi is scrupulous

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,760
and decisive.

111
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,845
He cooperates with Jichang very well

112
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,279
and takes good care

113
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,640
of our wedding.

114
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,235
He’s indeed endearing.

115
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,920
Throughout Tianqi City,

116
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,920
everyone knows that

117
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
he’s your favorite apprentice.

118
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,519
If he can’t attend the banquet

119
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,640
of our wedding,

120
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,119
isn’t it a pity?

121
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,559
For my sake,

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,079
how about letting him leave
after the wedding?

123
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,399
What do you think?

124
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,634
He’s got business to do.

125
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,399
I don’t want him to be held up

126
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,480
because of my private affairs.

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,000
Your Highness,

128
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,799
if you have any requirements
for the wedding,

129
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,600
you can tell Zhuoying or Shaozi.

130
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,480
What requirements do you have?

131
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
None.

132
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,559
We’ll just follow your requirements.

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,600
Lord, are you getting tired

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,900
because you’re too busy

135
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,959
with trifles?

136
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,559
This is the way I usually behave.

137
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,230
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

138
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,175
If you don’t mind,

139
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,950
I’ll leave you alone.

140
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,279
Master.

141
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,959
Master, you asked to see me?

142
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,629
Your secondment is due.

143
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,694
Time to return to Huangquan Pass.

144
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
I asked His Majesty for permission.

145
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,276
The transfer order will be issued
in a day or two.

146
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,350
Go get packed.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,759
Needn’t I wait
until you have your wedding?

148
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

149
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,950
Business comes first.

150
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,000
I see.

151
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,760
If there is nothing else,

152
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,111
I’ll leave you alone.

153
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,055
Haishi.

154
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,359
You’ve grown up.

155
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,100
Don’t always have fights.

156
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,125
It’s time to think
about the marriage thing.

157
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,400
If you have someone

158
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,359
in your heart,

159
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,746
discharge yourself from the army
when you have time.

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
Change your identity

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,539
and be a girl again.

162
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,034
In a year or so,

163
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,594
I’ll make a match between you and him.

164
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:41,950
You know whom I like.

165
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,751
Why do you bother to say so?

166
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,275
Big brother,

167
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:23,065
the wedding for Mudan
will follow the old customs.

168
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,080
All the buildings should be renovated.

169
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,850
Also, Lord Qinghai is a nobleman.

170
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,285
There’s a specification

171
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,679
according to the peerage, carriages

172
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:35,895
and the size of the wedding.

173
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
As for jade articles, bamboo articles...

174
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,080
What time is it?

175
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,359
...wooden furniture,

176
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:41,275
- ritual articles...
- For your information, Your Majesty,

177
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,275
- it’s nearly seven.
- And...

178
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:44,675
- Jichang.
- All kinds of articles.

179
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:45,250
Ah?

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
I’ve asked you

181
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,239
to arrange for Mudan’s wedding.

182
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,080
Why do you still ask about such details

183
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,625
in the final stage?

184
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Mr. Fang Haishi and I

185
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,400
have handled such trifles

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,950
for Mudan’s wedding.

187
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,119
But...

188
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,250
But I don’t dare

189
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,359
to make the final decision.

190
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
So, Your Majesty,

191
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,880
please make a final decision.

192
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,039
Just follow the old customs.

193
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,095
I’d like to thank you, Your Majesty,

194
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,799
on behalf of Mudan.

195
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,280
Jichang,

196
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,299
you should be

197
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,175
more decisive.

198
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,900
Oh.

199
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,156
I see. Leave me alone.

200
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,605
- I’m leaving, Your Majesty.
- I’m leaving, Your Majesty.

201
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,300
Ouch.

202
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,939
Your Majesty,

203
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,276
time to have dinner.

204
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,825
Mm.

205
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:48,795
I’m going to Jincheng Palace.

206
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,489
Yes.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,799
Your Majesty.

208
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,225
Don’t bother.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,039
It’s cold at night.

210
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,799
You needn’t have waited here.

211
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,525
You were busy with political affairs

212
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,975
and I didn’t dare to disturb you.

213
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,239
But I thought

214
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,875
it would be better

215
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,359
if I could accompany you

216
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,239
on your way back

217
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,479
after you finished working.

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,280
Besides,

219
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,650
Lord Qinghai will marry the Princess.

220
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,159
I want to discuss with you

221
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,209
on what present I should prepare.

222
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,159
Your hands are still so cold.

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,159
Let’s not talk about the present thing

224
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,825
until we get back.

225
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,650
Mm.

226
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,359
Greetings, Your Majesty.

227
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,359
Greetings, Your Highness.

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,400
You may rise.

229
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,875
What did you come for?

230
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,719
My secondment is due.

231
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,725
I’m going back to Huangquan Pass.

232
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,116
I came to bid farewell.

233
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,000
Jianming is so stubborn

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
that he forced you to leave, right?

235
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,080
I told him about it.

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,075
You can leave after his wedding.

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,025
Thank you for the concern, Your Majesty.

238
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,760
Master wants me

239
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,225
to return to Huangquan Pass as scheduled

240
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,289
because he has high expectations for me

241
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,940
and entrusts me with important things.

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,919
I don’t want to disappoint him.

243
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,840
In this case,

244
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,650
you can leave as scheduled.

245
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,175
I won’t keep you.

246
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,779
Thank you, Your Majesty.

247
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,220
Farewell, Your Majesty.

248
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
Farewell, Your Highness.

249
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,450
Mm.

250
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,176
Why does Jianming
want Fang Haishi to leave

251
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,599
so urgently?

252
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,889
Haishi.

253
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,150
You’re seldom at leisure

254
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,389
and ask to meet me.

255
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,740
I came to bid farewell to you.

256
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,000
Farewell?

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,675
Mm.

258
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,559
Actually,

259
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,719
I belong to Huangquan Battalion.

260
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,640
I only stay in the capital
for a secondment.

261
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,960
Now, the secondment is due.

262
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,919
Tomorrow, I’m going north

263
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,719
back to Huangquan Battalion.

264
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:12,934
So soon?

265
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:17,875
What a pity!

266
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,434
Pity?

267
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,000
Nothing.

268
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,119
I had planned to do something.

269
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
But looks like

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,479
there’s no time for me.

271
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:28,559
Don’t worry.

272
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,039
Your problem is mine.

273
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,280
Just tell me about it.

274
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,440
It can’t be rushed.

275
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,050
You’ll come back someday.

276
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,200
I can wait

277
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,919
until you’re back.

278
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:44,919
Here.

279
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:46,225
Take it back.

280
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:51,964
You don’t like it?

281
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,251
You’ve helped me a lot lately.

282
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,200
But I haven’t repaid you.

283
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,325
This is too expensive.

284
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,239
I can’t accept it.

285
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,440
I help you,

286
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,919
but never expect anything in return.

287
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,400
Fine, then.

288
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,575
I’ll keep it for you

289
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,675
until you come back.

290
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,000
Mm.

291
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,080
By the way,

292
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:24,365
have you brought the liquor you brewed?

293
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I remember

294
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,700
you brewed it with Jifeng Flowers.

295
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,640
It tastes

296
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,925
aromatic and sweet.

297
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,286
I can’t help thinking of it.

298
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,520
I certainly have brought it.

299
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,680
Why are you here alone

300
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
and staring blankly?

301
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,319
I’m leaving tomorrow.

302
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,075
I want a close look at Jifeng Flowers.

303
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,625
Yeah.

304
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,975
How time flies!

305
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,119
Master and I agreed

306
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,640
to have a drink freely with you

307
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:43,800
under Jifeng Tree

308
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
after you came back.

309
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:46,455
But before we do that,

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,850
you’re leaving again.

311
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,980
It’s just fate, I guess.

312
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:52,506
After I came back,

313
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,079
I watched Jifeng Flowers with you.

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,441
And I watched them with Youdu.

315
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:58,935
But Master...

316
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,580
Youdu?

317
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,376
When did he come to Zhaoming Palace?

318
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,640
No.

319
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,359
I watched them at the West Market.

320
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,959
Nonsense.

321
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,839
Jifeng Tree is very rare

322
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,959
and it’s hard to grow.

323
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,839
This is the only one in Tianqi City.

324
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,050
Why could there be Jifeng Flowers
at the West Market?

325
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,141
That’s true.

326
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,160
Someone played a magic trick

327
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,680
in front of me

328
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,640
and I saw the whirling Jifeng Flowers.

329
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,825
“I was as depressed
as the white pear flowers.

330
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,439
Then I saw through
the complicated life.”

331
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,435
Over the past few years,

332
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,760
I seem to have lived my life

333
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,599
in a magic trick.

334
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,589
Haishi.

335
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,800
Zhuoying,

336
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,239
early tomorrow morning,

337
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,040
I’m leaving.

338
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,920
I don’t like parting.

339
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,475
I won’t say goodbye to your face.

340
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,935
I’ll guard Huangquan Pass carefully.

341
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,375
Hope you and Master
will take good care of yourselves.

342
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,775
♪The moon saw♪

343
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,850
♪How much I missed you at night♪

344
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:56,500
♪Without you
Only wind kept me company♪

345
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,319
Soon, there’s a test
for horsemanship and archery.

346
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,725
You always do a good job.

347
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:01,839
Put up a good show.

348
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,119
I see, Master.

349
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,800
Thank you, Master.

350
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:06,719
Master.

351
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,525
Master.

352
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,319
Morning.

353
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,075
Morning, Master.

354
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,400
What? You didn’t sleep well last night?

355
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,000
Last night,

356
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,280
I was wrapping the ring with thread.

357
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,125
It’s a bit big for me.

358
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,079
Now that I want to wear it,

359
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,245
I think I should make it suitable.

360
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,000
It was so inconsiderate of me.

361
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,520
It’s my old ring.

362
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
I should have given you a new one.

363
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,800
No, no, no.

364
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,000
I like the old one.

365
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,599
Every single thing of yours

366
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,175
matters a lot

367
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,255
to me.

Master,

394
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,319
nice to write to you.

395
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,009
I used to be very stubborn.

396
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,630
I never believed that

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,239
everything was decided

398
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,570
by fate and human efforts.

399
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,995
I often disobeyed you,

400
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:15,439
which caused that
there was no turning back

401
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,118
for you and me.

402
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
It’s a lesson I should learn.

403
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,101
I should change my temper

404
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,979
and make a fresh start.

405
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,480
Take care, Master.

406
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,195
Your apprentice Fang Haishi

407
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:31,154
hereby kowtows to you.

408
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,650
Farewell.

409
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,075
(Tianqi)

410
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,479
Your Highness,

411
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,100
please take the medicine
before you read.

412
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:14,985
Have some sweets.

413
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,119
You’ve taken so much medicine

414
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,375
that you no longer
feel the bitter taste.

415
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,750
His Majesty has come.

416
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

417
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,825
Don’t stand on ceremony.

418
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,425
Tilan,

419
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,785
what are you reading?

420
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,560
I’m reading a book

421
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,680
about folk customs in Tianqi City.

422
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Since when

423
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,800
were you interested

424
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
in folk customs?

425
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,145
I just want to know more.

426
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,760
You and I didn’t grow up

427
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,275
in the same city.

428
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,825
What kind of folk customs

429
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:01,350
have you seen?

430
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,349
What songs have you listened to?

431
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,760
How do you spend the winter?

432
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,175
How do you relieve the summer heat?

433
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,600
I want to know more about everything.

434
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,551
Your Majesty, what makes you frown?

435
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,450
Is there anything bothering you?

436
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:20,435
Early this morning, Fang Haishi

437
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,800
returned to Huangquan Battalion.

438
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,595
So early?

439
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,199
Bring it to me.

440
00:24:57,725 --> 00:24:58,600
Your Majesty,

441
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,640
what’s this?

442
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,430
I granted Jianming and Mudan
the marriage.

443
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,314
They’ll have the wedding
in a couple of days.

444
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:09,000
By then, Mudan will come
to Jincheng Palace

445
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,760
and bid farewell to me.

446
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,160
Stay there with me.

447
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,079
I know you’re not prepared for that.

448
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,040
I asked them

449
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,199
to make a new dress

450
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,880
of your size.

451
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:22,306
Your Majesty, are you asking me

452
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,799
to see Her Highness off with you?

453
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,760
What?

454
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,199
You don’t want that?

455
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:33,725
Your Highness,

456
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,575
it’s a great honor.

457
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,079
But...

458
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,479
But Your Majesty,

459
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,599
only the Empress can accompany you

460
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,975
when seeing the Princess off.

461
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,719
I don’t dare to overstep my authority.

462
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,520
When I think you can do that,

463
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,175
you can do that.

464
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,275
Take it.

465
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,209
Father, is it the ring
you use to draw the bow?

466
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,325
It’s big for you now.

467
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,600
But as you grow up,

468
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,759
you can use it.

469
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,079
Try it on

470
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,319
and see if you like it.

471
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,400
(Princess’s Mansion)
Be very careful.

472
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,350
Work carefully.

473
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,875
Be careful.

474
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,040
- It’s the wedding for the Princess.
- Go beneath.

475
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,560
- Nothing can go wrong.
- Come on. Here’s something more.

476
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,479
Firewood carrier,
don’t bump into anyone.

477
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,319
- All right.
- Watch out for stairs.

478
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,719
Hey, deliverymen.

479
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,839
Be gentle.

480
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,719
- Don’t crush
- Bring them to the yard.

481
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,000
- the vegetables.
- Oh.

482
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,160
Be gentle. Be gentle.

483
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,040
Who put the case there?

484
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:09,800
Deliveryman, come on.

485
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,680
Be quick.

486
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,850
Move the case away.

487
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,239
Be careful.

488
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,479
It’s newly painted.

489
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,479
Don’t ever

490
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,479
scratch it.

491
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,250
Higher. Higher.

492
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,160
- Oh.
- All right. All right.

493
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,319
Yes, yes.

494
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,000
Look at you.

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,040
How impolite you are!

496
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,959
If the back door weren’t crowded

497
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,920
for the wedding of Her Highness,

498
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,400
you wouldn’t have been allowed
to use the front door.

499
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,750
- How ungrateful!
- To the right. Right.

500
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,725
Right. It deviated.

501
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,719
Quickly. Quickly.

502
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,599
You.

503
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,479
And you.

504
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,782
Be quick.

505
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,746
Align them up there.

506
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,775
All right.

507
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,968
How’s it now?

508
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,040
A bit lower.

509
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:42,880
All right. All right.

510
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:46,839
Check it.

511
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,680
Is it straight?

512
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,880
Get more red cloth.

513
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,040
Be right there.

514
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,250
All right.

515
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,329
This way. This way.

516
00:28:03,775 --> 00:28:04,694
All right.

517
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,199
Young Master Zhuoying,

518
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:10,839
you’re back.

519
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:12,000
Lord asked you to see him

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,150
in his study immediately.

521
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,075
Mm.

522
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,975
Master, you asked to see me?

523
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,479
Farewell, Your Majesty.

524
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:19,935
Farewell, Your Highness.

525
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,775
I’ll go attend the wedding banquet

526
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,374
at your mansion.

527
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,599
Your Highness.

528
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:59,134
Wash hands and salute.

529
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,640
The couple will always love each other

530
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,040
just like long-lasting flowers.

531
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:49,895
Drink the liquor.

532
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:59,439
You’ll get married

533
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,400
now and forever.

534
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,880
Drink again.

535
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:14,239
Have a happy life

536
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,439
and grow old together.

537
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,519
Do the ending part.

538
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,825
Bow to each other.

539
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,881
Done.

540
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,439
A toast to His Majesty.

541
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:49,636
Princess Yanling shall
propose a toast to His Majesty.

542
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,199
Come on. This way.

543
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,186
Your Majesty,

544
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,190
may our state always be peaceful

545
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
and may you live a long life.

546
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:09,160
Good.

547
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,359
Here, Your Majesty.

548
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,090
Lord Qinghai shall
propose a toast to His Majesty.

549
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,239
It’s poisonous!

550
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,719
Big brother!

551
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:45,040
Your Majesty!

552
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,880
Big brother!

553
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,599
What?

554
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,075
Why would this happen?

555
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:47,920
- Your Majesty!
- Big brother!

556
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,119
- Your Majesty!
- Big brother!

557
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:50,200
Why would this happen?

558
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,239
- Go get the physician! Now!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

559
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Your Majesty!

560
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,700
What happened to His Majesty?

561
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,680
He drank the poisonous liquor

562
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,760
and he won’t live.

563
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,160
You’re rebelling!

564
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:00,275
Why, Mudan?

565
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:01,599
He’s brutal and immoral.

566
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,319
He trusts flattering officials
and kills loyal ones.

567
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,520
He should have been killed long ago!

568
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:06,439
Big brother is nice to us.

569
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:08,719
Lord Qinghai is innocent, too.

570
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,919
You have no proof.

571
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:11,959
Proof?

572
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,025
Mr. Su Ming is the proof!

573
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,225
- Ah?
- What?

574
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,080
- Didn’t Su Ming defect from us?
- He defected, didn’t he?

575
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,120
- Yeah.
- That’s right.

576
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,399
Fellows.

577
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,425
Ah?

578
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:22,719
Su Ming?

579
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,520
Fellows.

580
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Su Ming.

581
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,000
It’s really him.

582
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,840
It’s really him.

583
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,120
- He’s back.
- Why’s he back?

584
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,840
What’s he doing here?

585
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,159
Why is he here?

586
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,280
What’s going on?

587
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,360
I didn’t defect.

588
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,159
Fang Jianming was jealous of me

589
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,800
and he framed me up.

590
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,239
Then I had to leave Dazheng.

591
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,199
Emperor Xu and Fang Zhu

592
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,000
are fatuous.

593
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
Fearing that the Six Wing Generals
might hold great power,

594
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,879
they were expelling those
who didn’t support them.

595
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,399
Today, I helped Princess Yanling

596
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,959
only for the sake of Dazheng!

597
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:06,700
As a member of the imperial family,

598
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,159
Her Highness will certainly

599
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,800
pick a wise emperor

600
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,320
to take the throne.

601
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,879
(Princess’s Mansion)

602
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:22,879
On my command!

603
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,120
Once the order is given,

604
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,600
break into the Princess’s Mansion.

605
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,719
Yes!

606
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,679
What?

607
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,520
Everybody,

608
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,159
Beifu Army has

609
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,679
besieged the Princess’s Mansion.

610
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
They came to support Princess Yanling.

611
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,239
Emperor Xu is dead!

612
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,399
Everybody,

613
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,520
time to make your choice.

614
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,159
We’ll take your orders, Your Highness.

615
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,520
I’ll be at your command, too.

616
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,520
So will we.

617
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,399
I’ll take your order, Your Highness.

618
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,439
So will I.

619
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,239
So will I.

620
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,399
Fang Jianming,

621
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,320
you’re dying today.

622
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,560
Go to hell.

623
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,200
Fang Haishi?

624
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,050
- Fang Haishi?
- Fang Haishi?

625
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,639
You came back to get killed, didn’t you?

626
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:16,487
What?

627
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:21,239
- Your Majesty?
- Your Majesty.

628
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:21,879
- Splendid.
- Your Majesty.

629
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,650
- What?
- Your Majesty.

630
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,500
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

631
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,959
- Look!
- Big brother.

632
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:26,875
- Your Majesty.
- His Majesty is all right.

633
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:27,479
Your Majesty.

634
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:28,159
Your Majesty.

635
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:29,959
Big brother! Big brother!

636
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:32,200
His Majesty is all right.

637
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,040
- Big brother.
- Your Majesty.

638
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,800
You’re not dead?

639
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,159
I’m dead?

640
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,000
If I were dead,

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,520
I would miss the fun, wouldn’t I?

642
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,080
Don’t panic.

643
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,719
We have so many masters.

644
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,555
And Beifu Army is out there.

645
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,199
What?

646
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,225
What’s going on?

647
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,001
Beifu Army?

648
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:14,770
- Mm...
- Well...

649
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,560
Why?

650
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,399
They’re trusted followers
of His Majesty.

651
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,760
Your men were arrested long ago.

652
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:20,800
Jianming,

653
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,439
now that the bad men have appeared,

654
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:25,424
wipe them out.

655
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,560
Yes.

656
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,840
Be careful, big brother!

657
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,679
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

658
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,280
Go after Princess Yanling.

659
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,925
I’ll take care of it here.

660
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:51,525
Mm.

661
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,925
Jichang. Jichang!

662
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,199
The arrow is poisonous!

663
00:37:59,199 --> 00:37:59,719
Quickly!

664
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,775
- Your Majesty!
- Quickly!

665
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:01,600
Mu Deqing!

666
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,719
- Be quick!
- Here, Your Majesty.

667
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,600
Take Lord Chang to his mansion

668
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,639
and get imperial physicians to him.

669
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,159
Yes!

670
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,199
Lord Chang, come on.

671
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:26,600
Youdu?

672
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,439
Let me help you.

673
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:28,625
Mm.

674
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,639
Yingnian.

675
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,360
We can’t escape.

676
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,520
Why don’t we just fight it out?

677
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,080
Your Highness,

678
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,159
you’re a princess.

679
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:45,919
I won’t let you die.

680
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,679
I’ve worked for you for years.

681
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,639
I care for no one, but you.

682
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,159
As long as you can remember me,

683
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,199
I’ll die without regret.

684
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,239
Go, Your Highness!

685
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,100
Don’t bother about me!

686
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,560
Stop!

687
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,600
Please go back with me.

688
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:28,800
You knew

689
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,919
I was a fake princess,

690
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:30,800
didn’t you?

691
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,280
I didn’t.

692
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,225
Master and His Majesty knew that.

693
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,280
You can talk to them.

694
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
Zhang Yingnian is dead.

695
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,439
I don’t think

696
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:44,959
that’s what you expected.

697
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,750
Su Ming,

698
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,520
you can’t get away.

699
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:22,080
Because of you,

700
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,520
my father died in the war.

701
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,320
You assassinated the Six Wing Generals,

702
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,199
including Amolan and Gu Dacheng.

703
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,054
You killed so many people.

704
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,320
Today,

705
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,879
let’s put an end to it.

706
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,239
Why don’t you dare to refute it?

707
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,399
Are you scared of their ghosts?

708
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:49,479
I picked the way.

709
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,030
Then I had to do something.

710
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,639
You and Emperor Xu

711
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,159
will get the retributions.

712
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,800
Youdu,

713
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,080
thank you for helping me today.

714
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:31,959
You’re welcome.

715
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,610
You sound courteous.

716
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,520
By the way,

717
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,080
you always surprise me.

718
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:42,560
Didn’t you leave for Huangquan Pass?

719
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,320
Why did you come back?

720
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,600
I was on my way back to Huangquan Pass.

721
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:50,159
But when I was going out of the city,
I found...

722
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,000
I guessed something would happen.

723
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,199
(Towering Arch)
I didn’t want to alert them, though.

724
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,399
So,

725
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
I went out of the city
and headed for Huangquan Battalion.

726
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,959
I hid somewhere secretly

727
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:11,520
and when night fell,

728
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:12,926
I returned to the Palace.

729
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,325
Your Majesty,

730
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,639
it’s me.

731
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:41,840
Your Majesty,

732
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,679
sorry for breaking in so late

733
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,639
and disturbing you.

734
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,760
Please forgive me.

735
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,000
Forget it. You may rise.

736
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:51,850
Didn’t you go back to Huangquan Pass?

737
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,891
Why are you here?

738
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:55,479
On my way back to Huangquan Pass,

739
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,159
I found many more Huku people

740
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,600
in Tianqi City.

741
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,120
People of different nationalities
live in Tianqi City.

742
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,199
There are also
many businessmen and travelers.

743
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,520
But so many Huku people appeared

744
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,639
right before the wedding day
of Princess Yanling.

745
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,840
I still find it suspicious.

746
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,500
Tianqi City

747
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,821
is always perfectly guarded.

748
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,575
What?

749
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,639
Did you break in

750
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,400
because you didn’t trust Fang Jianming?

751
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:22,560
I broke in

752
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,919
because I was sure

753
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,840
you knew the truth, Your Majesty.

754
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,840
Mr. Fang Haishi,

755
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,475
what makes you so confident?

756
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,040
Tianqi City

757
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,800
is perfectly guarded.

758
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,679
So,

759
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,520
when Huku people came to Tianqi City,

760
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,320
Master must have known

761
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
the truth.

762
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,879
Now that he knows the truth,

763
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,800
you know it, too.

764
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:42,360
Besides,

765
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:45,080
Princess Yanling is your sister.

766
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:46,600
In your heart,

767
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,280
you know her best.

768
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,639
I returned

769
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,120
because I wanted

770
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,600
to help Your Majesty as much as I could.

771
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,919
Mr. Fang Haishi,

772
00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:01,639
you’re quite interesting.

773
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,120
Hope you will never

774
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
forget your original desire.

775
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,185
Don’t suspect
or go against Jianming, either.

776
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,479
It’ll be very dangerous tomorrow.

777
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:15,439
We may die.

778
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,625
Jianming asked you to leave

779
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:18,919
in case you get killed.

780
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:20,834
Under such circumstances,

781
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,865
will you still stay?

782
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,000
In this case,

783
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,719
I must stay

784
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,560
and struggle with you and Master.

785
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:33,100
Fine, then.

786
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,071
Disguise yourself

787
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,639
as my eunuch,

788
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,001
stay by my side,

789
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:40,850
and take action when necessary.

790
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,719
Haishi, it’s wise of you.

791
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,199
But it was really dangerous today.

792
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,080
I don’t know why

793
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,120
Master took a risky move.

794
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,600
I just feel that

795
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,360
he was eager to deal with Su Ming.

796
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,231
You think something may go wrong?

797
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,199
I’m not sure.

798
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,600
Master never tells anyone
in case of trouble.

799
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,360
No matter what trouble he’s in,

800
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,520
he doesn’t ask for help.

801
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,399
Stop worrying about him.

802
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,080
You’ve captured the fake princess.

803
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:08,959
It’ll certainly help him.

804
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,879
Before,

805
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,760
I suspected the fake princess

806
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,000
and checked on her several times.

807
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,080
But now,

808
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,560
I find her pitiful.

809
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,560
She sacrificed herself

810
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,800
just like seeking her own doom.

811
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
I’m sure

812
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,280
she has a reason for that.
