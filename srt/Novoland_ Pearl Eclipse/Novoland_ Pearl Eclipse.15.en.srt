=Episode 15=

25
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,479
Sea near Xiping Port

26
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,720
is always smooth

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,679
where seawater flows mildly.

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,559
This year, the seawater flows inversely,

29
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,880
so that enemy troops from Leizhou

30
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,119
advance eastward
along the ocean currents.

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,399
The speed of their ships

32
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,880
is much faster than that
of previous years.

33
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,559
The speed of arrow-shooting
is fiercer, too.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
It’s irresistible.

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,960
Is this the Moon Bay?

36
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:36,720
Yes.

37
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,279
This is the Moon Bay.

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
It’s dozens of kilometers
away from Xiping Port.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,720
As it looks like a crescent moon,

40
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,960
isn’t influenced by monsoons

41
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,039
and is separate
from the main Xiping Port,

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,679
every now and then,

43
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,279
people berth at the Moon Bay

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,039
to hide from storms.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,639
Have you cleared all the ships here?

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
Before the preparation for war,

47
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,320
all the ships berthing at the Moon Bay

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,039
were ordered to leave.

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,440
You want to lure the enemies in?

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,440
We have to

51
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,800
put a quick end to this war.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,399
Go transmit my order.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,919
Pretend we’re defeated

54
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,520
and lure the enemies into the Moon Bay.

55
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,199
Then make a fire attack

56
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,320
so that they have to abandon their ships
and go ashore.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,080
They’re good at fighting on the sea.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
On shore, they’ll be like the fish
out of the water.

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
I don’t think

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,119
they’ll fall into our trap easily.

61
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:22,279
They don’t want to go ashore

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,279
simply because
the bait isn’t big enough.

63
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,479
Go send out some news

64
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,399
that I’m checking the war situation

65
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,559
at the Moon Bay near the seashore.

66
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,119
Yes.

67
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:45,880
Mr. Fang,

68
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,039
that is the Red Plain.

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
It’s named

70
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,559
after Princess Hongyao.

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,839
Princess Hongyao?

72
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:52,759
Yes.

73
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,839
She was from the imperial clan.

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,839
She’s also the elder half-sister

75
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
of rebellious Prince Yi, Chu Fengyi.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,479
Years ago, she was married
to Huku for peace.

77
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,679
By the age of 32,

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,520
she had married three lords

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
and was very powerful.

80
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,479
When Prince Yi rebelled,

81
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,679
Princess Hongyao

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,639
dispatched reinforcements to him.

83
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,119
His Majesty and Lord Qinghai

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,080
led armies to Huku

85
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,399
and had a fierce battle
for four days and five nights

86
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,720
when more than 50 thousand enemies
were killed.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
Huku Army suffered heavy losses.

88
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,760
Princess Hongyao

89
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,880
was trampled to death in chaos.

90
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,239
Her youngest son

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,920
was also missing on the battlefield.

92
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,440
I’m afraid he’s already dead.

93
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,519
After that battle,

94
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,279
such a large field

95
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,119
was covered with red blood
and black slush.

96
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,519
The next year,

97
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,640
the weather was unusually warm.

98
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,679
On the Red Plain,

99
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,160
a little grass

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,519
grew out unexpectedly.

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
No animals eat the grass.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,839
Old people

103
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,839
call it Corpse Grass.

104
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,160
Every Tomb Sweeping Day,

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,480
the Red Plain

106
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,559
is crowded with women and children

107
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,880
who come for a memorial ceremony.

108
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,320
I heard about that terrible thing, too.

109
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,359
Now,

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,480
we’d better

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,600
find the Jiamanese as soon as possible.

112
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,399
Yes.

113
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,079
Mr. Fang!

114
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,799
Dacheng, take them away.

115
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,679
- Yes!
- Go!

116
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,079
Jiamanese, follow us!

117
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:57,839
Let’s go!

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,079
- Go!
- Go!

119
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
- Go!
- Go!

120
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,600
- Brother!
- Brother!

121
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,440
- Go!
- Go!

122
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,079
- Don’t worry about us.
- Don’t worry about us.

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
- Go!
- Go!

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,519
- Quickly!
- Go!

125
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,480
Go!

126
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,440
Be quick!

127
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,920
(Lanzi)

128
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,519
Follow up!

129
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,239
- Go!
- Quickly!

130
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,200
Be quick!

131
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,920
- Look!
- Go!

132
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,040
That...

133
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,799
That man.

134
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,799
He shot Lord of Left Pudun to death.

135
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:12,239
He did?

136
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,799
- Quickly!
- But he looks thin and short.

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,279
I didn’t know he could be so strong.

138
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,160
- Yeah.
- Go!

139
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,079
Look.

140
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,959
He’s chained.

141
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,359
If he weren’t strong,

142
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,119
General Luerdan

143
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,000
wouldn’t have chained him.

144
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,000
- Yeah.
- That’s right.

145
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,000
Follow up!

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,119
Go!

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Lord,

148
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,600
this man has great archery.

149
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,480
He killed

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,320
eight of our men alone.

151
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,880
He killed Lord of Left Pudun.

152
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,399
I think it’s true.

153
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,519
Protect Lord!

154
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,359
You’re brave and sharp-eyed.

155
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,320
You caught my dagger

156
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,519
and cut the chain with the dagger

157
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:27,160
made of adamant steel.

158
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,519
Do you know

159
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,640
that nobody managed to catch
my hidden weapon

160
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,239
in Huku?

161
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,799
It’s easy to catch it.

162
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,359
Why not surrender to me?

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,080
I can give you gold

164
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,159
and the most beautiful girl

165
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,599
on the grassland.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,159
I can make you capture territory

167
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,440
as a powerful man on the grassland.

168
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,320
Since I joined the army,

169
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,000
I’ve no longer considered
my life or death.

170
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Not to mention your poor offer.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,840
You face death unflinchingly.

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,559
But your subordinates

173
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,520
and the Jiamanese
may be afraid of death.

174
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,200
Execute them!

175
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,359
Wait!

176
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,479
Interesting.

177
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
You’re from Dazheng,

178
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,280
but you know

179
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,080
our rules.

180
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,080
Little man,

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,840
do you know you need a stake

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
if you challenge me?

183
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
If I lose,

184
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,799
I’ll surrender to you.

185
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,440
If you lose,

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,960
release my subordinates and me.

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,039
All right.

188
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,880
Would you like to fight with a weapon

189
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,239
or fight bare-handed?

190
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,719
You look weak.

191
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,440
You can use the dagger.

192
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,479
I’ll use no weapon.

193
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,880
Lord,

194
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
he’s very sly. Don’t do that.

195
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:00,679
If you lose,

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,479
surrender to me.

197
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,559
If you win by chance,

198
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,880
either you

199
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,479
or the other prisoners can leave.

200
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,159
You must make your choice.

201
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,719
If you can’t make a decision,

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,280
take a rain check.

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,239
Wait.

204
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,559
If I win,

205
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,159
please release

206
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,799
my subordinates and the Jiamanese.

207
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,400
Victory! Victory! Victory!

208
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,479
Victory! Victory! Victory!

209
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,719
Victory! Victory! Victory!

210
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,960
Victory! Victory! Victory!

211
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,000
Victory! Victory! Victory!

212
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Victory! Victory! Victory!

213
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,599
Victory! Victory! Victory!

214
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,119
Victory! Victory! Victory!

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Let’s fight!

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,159
You’re indeed the strong man I want.

217
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Time to keep your promise.

218
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,159
I’ll let the prisoners

219
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,840
and the Jiamanese leave Lanzi,

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,760
but not now.

221
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,880
What does that mean?

222
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,039
When we made a bet,

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
I didn’t say I would
release them immediately.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,960
In case of causing chaos in the camp,

225
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,440
such prisoners and the Jiamanese

226
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,799
have to be released in batches.

227
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,239
Unless you want them to die,

228
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:26,159
try resisting back again.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,559
You’re breaking your promise!

230
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:39,320
Good steel is indeed needed
for a good dagger.

231
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,119
Put him in prison.

232
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,599
Remember. Keep him in a cell alone.

233
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,080
It’s cold at night.

235
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,359
Lord doesn’t want you to catch a cold.

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,039
Report.

237
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,159
(Xiping Port)

238
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,280
Lord,

239
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,440
our enemies really fell in our trap.

240
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,479
When their ships were burned,

241
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,840
they had to abandon their ships
and go ashore.

242
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,799
Lord, the horse is ready.

243
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,960
Go.

244
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,159
There’s another thing.

245
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,200
A report came from Huangquan Battalion

246
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,159
that Young Master Haishi was captured
by the Right Tribe of Huku.

247
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:16,919
What?

248
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,640
- Lord.
- Lord.

249
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:24,840
Lord,

250
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,559
I owe someone my life.

251
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,359
I must repay him.

252
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,039
You’re a hero.

253
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,479
I’m sorry to have hurt you
when you were flurried.

254
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,200
Please don’t blame me.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,559
Lord.

256
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,719
Lord.

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,559
How’s everything going out there?

258
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,159
As you predicted,

259
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,159
when our enemies went ashore,

260
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,520
their combat effectiveness
sharply declined.

261
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,640
We then besieged them

262
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,679
and nearly killed them all.

263
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:08,960
Some of their ships
that haven’t entered the Moon Bay

264
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,559
are trying to escape.

265
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,520
We’re intercepting them.

266
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
What about our soldiers?

267
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,760
For your information,

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,559
as we set many traps,

269
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,119
we’ve only lost a few soldiers.

270
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,039
Lord,

271
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,880
you’re badly wounded.

272
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,280
You need more rest.

273
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,400
I...

274
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,159
I didn’t know Xiu Feng

275
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,640
wanted to hurt you.

276
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,919
I’ll investigate him immediately.

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,760
Lord, don’t take rash actions.

278
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,280
Be careful with your wound.

279
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,400
Lord,

280
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,280
there are two enemy ships.

281
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,640
One is here,

282
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,919
and the other is here.

283
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,320
They’re both escaping
towards the deep sea.

284
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,000
Have one team stay here,

285
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
one team go after them

286
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,359
and one team intercept them.

287
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,520
Before the sunrise,

288
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,679
annihilate all the remaining enemies.

289
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:00,719
Yes.

290
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
I’ll go give the order.

291
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,080
Haishi,

292
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,359
hang in there.

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Fang Haishi

294
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,919
was captured alive
by the Right Tribe of Huku?

295
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,200
Good.

296
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Very good.

297
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,000
Miss Ju, you must know that

298
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,039
I inherited the title of lord.

299
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,799
So, our story was brought up again.

300
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,080
Today, I came

301
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,239
to make everything clear.

302
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,039
After my parents died,

303
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,320
I swore that

304
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,920
I wouldn’t be selfish,

305
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,439
I wouldn’t get married,

306
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,439
and I would devote myself to the state

307
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,280
and make contributions to it.

308
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,079
Our parents

309
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,839
agreed on our marriage.

310
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,479
But we didn’t have an agreement.

311
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,079
Hope you’ll no longer hold yourself up.

312
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,359
No longer hold up for you?

313
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,280
But I’ve held myself up

314
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,400
for so many years.

315
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:19,600
(Jubei Town)

316
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,599
We won the war.

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
Check over the battlefield

318
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,479
and reorganize Xiping Port.

319
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Write a detailed military report

320
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,079
and have it sent to His Majesty
in Tianqi.

321
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,640
Do it without delay.

322
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,199
Also,

323
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,439
don’t tell others

324
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,520
that I’ve been wounded

325
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,959
in case of shaking the army’s morale.

326
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes.

327
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
Huangquan Pass is far away.

328
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,280
You’ll have a long trip

329
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,319
before you recover.

330
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:43,119
I’m worried that...

331
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,199
Don’t be worried.

332
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,680
I’ll see you again.

333
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,599
See you, Lord.

334
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,160
There’s only one door

335
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,400
to this cell.

336
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,359
Remember carefully.

337
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,640
Once you see Fang Haishi coming out,

338
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:20,959
shoot him immediately.

339
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,439
But Lord wants to conquer him.

340
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:23,760
Don’t you fear that...?

341
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,280
He’s from Dazheng.

342
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,400
He isn’t one of us.

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,119
Even if he’s conquered,

344
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,640
he’ll be an awl in our pocket.

345
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,079
Sooner or later, he’ll pierce the pocket

346
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,239
and hurt us.

347
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,599
After we kill him,

348
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,359
I’ll explain to Lord.

349
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,640
Time for lunch.

350
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:37,839
I want some water.

351
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,119
Here’s some water, isn’t it?

352
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,160
I want to get washed.

353
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,479
Get washed?

354
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,319
You’re a prisoner.

355
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,760
You’re lucky enough
to have food and water.

356
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,680
But you still want to get washed?

357
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,119
If I don’t get washed,

358
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,199
I can’t start to have lunch.

359
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,719
Then I’ll die of hunger.

360
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,160
By then,

361
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,319
how can you explain to your lord?

362
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,359
Wait.

363
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,640
How fussy!

364
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,439
Fire!

365
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,880
Fire!

366
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,040
Go get some water!

367
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,359
- Go get some water!
- Fire!

368
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,079
- Fire!
- He’s very sly.

369
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,319
Shall we go have a look?

370
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,439
Wait out here.

371
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,119
- Somebody!
- When Fang Haishi comes out,

372
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,560
kill him.

373
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,119
Fire!

374
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,319
- Lord.
- Lord.

375
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,959
What happened?

376
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,239
Why is it on fire?

377
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,719
I brought the lunch to Fang Haishi.

378
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,319
But he tried to break the prison

379
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,239
and knocked us out.

380
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,239
We accidentally knocked down the brazier

381
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,000
and caused a fire.

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,239
Where’s Fang Haishi then?

383
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,760
He escaped.

384
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,719
Or he’s still in there.

385
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Then go and rescue him!

386
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

387
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,839
Why isn’t he here?

388
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,880
Aertai?

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,319
Why was he burnt to death?

390
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,760
Fang Haishi!

391
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,719
Stop running!

392
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,439
Protect Lord!

393
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,959
Wait.

394
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,640
Fang Haishi set fire
and broke the prison.

395
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,719
He can’t be spared.

396
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,880
You’ve prepared

397
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,959
quite a lot of archers.

398
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,920
If I hadn’t heard

399
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,839
the voice of your lord,

400
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,560
I wouldn’t even dare to come out.

401
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,000
Luerdan,

402
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,479
why did you come

403
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,599
in the early morning

404
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,479
with so many archers?

405
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,199
I came with them

406
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:24,599
in case that Fang Haishi would
break the prison.

407
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,000
Unexpectedly,

408
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,359
he just did that.

409
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,599
Are you saying you can foretell things?

410
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,479
Then why didn’t you foretell

411
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,479
who poisoned

412
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,920
my lunch for today

413
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,400
and who

414
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,199
deliberately loosened the lock

415
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
of my cell

416
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,040
so that I would want to break out?

417
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,439
If I guess correctly,

418
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,439
you also prepared

419
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,640
the archers for me.

420
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,119
Were you trying to shoot me to death?

421
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,400
Luerdan,

422
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,839
how dare you!

423
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,560
If I hadn’t turned your trick
to my own use,

424
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,280
asked for some water
to wet the hide,

425
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,079
and kicked over the brazier,

426
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,199
I would have been dead in the cell.

427
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,280
Without the testimony,

428
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,719
who would know

429
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,079
how I really died?

430
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:02,839
You’re slinging mud at me!

431
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,640
You mean I slandered you?

432
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,880
Fine.

433
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,040
You gave me the pancake, didn’t you?

434
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,560
Why don’t you eat it?

435
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,439
Lord,

436
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,199
I swear to the gods

437
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,599
that I’m loyal to you.

438
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,319
But this man is vicious

439
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,239
and cunning.

440
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,959
We can’t keep him
in case of future trouble!

441
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,239
Go put out the fire.

442
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:39,359
Yes.

443
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:40,880
Are you hurt?

444
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,880
Report!

445
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:43,839
Lord,

446
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,040
Lord Duoluo of Left Pudun
came to the South Gate

447
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,079
with a group of people,

448
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:48,719
asking you to give Fang Haishi to him.

449
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,160
Luerdan,

450
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
stay and put out the fire.

451
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,239
You

452
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,479
get more men

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
to take Fang Haishi to my mansion
and lock him up

454
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,880
before I give you another order.

455
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,119
You go gather our men

456
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,199
and go to the South Gate with me.

457
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,199
- Yes.
- Go.

458
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,799
(Lanzi)

459
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,599
Uncle Earlji,

460
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,439
hope that you are all well!

461
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,680
Duoluo,

462
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,599
you just became the lord

463
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,239
and you came with your men.

464
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don’t think you simply

465
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,520
want to visit me.

466
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,040
Now that you know what I want,

467
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,479
please give me the enemy of our tribe

468
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,000
so that

469
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,760
you can explain to my subordinates

470
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,800
and me.

471
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,160
You should go to Huangquan Pass

472
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,880
to find your enemy.

473
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:35,920
Why did you ask me for him?

474
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,359
The man who killed the deceased lord

475
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,560
is Fang Haishi.

476
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,199
During the fight on the Red Plain,

477
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,079
you captured him

478
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,680
and had a competition with him.

479
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,040
He even defeated you.

480
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,160
Everybody knows it in the Right Tribe.

481
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,520
Now that you don’t want

482
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,400
to kill Fang Haishi

483
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,680
to avenge the deceased lord,

484
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:54,880
then

485
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,760
I have to come and ask you for him.

486
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:01,000
Fang Haishi.

487
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,400
I’ve never seen such a man.

488
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,359
What does he look like?

489
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,800
When it’s convenient for me,

490
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
I’ll go to Huangquan Pass with you
to get him.

491
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:24,800
Do you mean you won’t give him to me?

492
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,439
Duoluo,

493
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,599
I’m firmly anchored in Lanzi.

494
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:35,800
I won’t be scared

495
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,359
of hundreds of soldiers
you have brought.

496
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,160
You just settled down in Lanzi.

497
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,760
You’re not anchored yet.

498
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
Are you really so confident

499
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,959
that you can stop us?

500
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,400
Don’t you fear
that I have a backup plan?

501
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:46,719
Lord,

502
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:47,839
you cherish the talented man.

503
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,280
But we haven’t been anchored

504
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,439
in Lanzi yet.

505
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,560
If we fight the Left Tribe

506
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,520
simply for a prisoner,

507
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,479
it’ll be bad for us.

508
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,920
Uncle,

509
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,479
give Fang Haishi to me

510
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
and I’ll leave immediately.

511
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,760
Lanzi

512
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,199
is yours.

513
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,640
Lord, the latest intel.

514
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,079
The prisoner is a girl.

515
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,280
Duoluo,

516
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,160
I’m your uncle.

517
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,119
We don’t need to be at loggerheads.

518
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
You want to see the one

519
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,160
who dueled with me, right?

520
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,760
I’ll have my men

521
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,400
to get him to you.

522
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,000
Lord asked you to put on a women’s dress

523
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,359
and go to the South Gate.

524
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,079
This is the new way

525
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,319
to humiliate me?

526
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,439
Just do it.

527
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,719
Stop talking nonsense.

528
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,280
According to Lord,
stall for as much time as you want.

529
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,839
Ten prisoners will be killed
for a quarter.

530
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:23,760
I dare you!

531
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,000
If you fail to reach the South Gate
in three quarters,

532
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,400
all the prisoners will be killed.

533
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,560
(Lanzi)
Uncle,

534
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,079
the sun is nearly shining overhead.

535
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Are you waiting for someone

536
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,000
or are you transferring your soldiers?

537
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:15,959
Beautiful.

538
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,280
You look more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

539
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,479
You’ll give me to him?

540
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,959
How’s that possible?

541
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
You and the prisoners

542
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,680
belong to me.

543
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,479
I just want

544
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,520
to show you to them

545
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,439
in case they do something

546
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,199
they never should.

547
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,359
I know.

548
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
You’re never docile.

549
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,239
But today,

550
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,920
you’d better take my order.

551
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,920
Or once the war starts,

552
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,119
the prisoners and the Jiamanese

553
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,199
will suffer first.

554
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:49,920
Come on.

555
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,640
Get down with me.

556
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,319
(Lanzi)

557
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,439
Uncle,

558
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,199
we’re asking for Fang Haishi

559
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,359
who killed our deceased lord.

560
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,680
If you think

561
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,560
you can solve the problem

562
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,880
by giving us a girl,

563
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,880
I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.

564
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,239
I told you

565
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,400
I never know anyone

566
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,520
named Fang Haishi.

567
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,239
But if you want the one

568
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,640
who dueled with me

569
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,359
and defeated me,

570
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:58,359
I’ve brought her

571
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,839
to you.

572
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:02,520
This is my new girl.

573
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,160
Tidi,

574
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,839
let him take a look at you.

575
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:10,560
You knew what happened

576
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,839
so quickly.

577
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,199
I believe you must have an informer

578
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,800
in Lanzi.

579
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,680
If you don’t believe me,

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,079
get your informer out

581
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,400
and let him recognize

582
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,160
if she’s the girl

583
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,439
who dueled with me.

584
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,439
I’m really curious.

585
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,719
What kind of girl

586
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,760
makes you have such a broad smile?

587
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,319
Duoluo!

588
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,119
You!

589
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,079
Come out.

590
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,280
Look carefully.

591
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:09,640
Is she the one

592
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,599
who dueled with your lord?

593
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,439
I’m not sure.

594
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,000
Stop!

595
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:32,599
Duoluo!

596
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:33,959
Lord.

597
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,520
Lord.

598
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,560
Sorry, Lord,

599
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,839
but I indeed captured Fang Haishi

600
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:44,880
on the Red Plain.

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,680
What?

602
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,199
But he was very sly.

603
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,599
This morning, he set fire in his cell

604
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,000
and tried to escape from the prison.

605
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,400
I shot him to death in the cell

606
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
and he was burnt in the fire.

607
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,959
I didn’t report it to you

608
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,000
so that there was some misunderstanding

609
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,040
between you and Lord of Left Pudun.

610
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,560
For the sake

611
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,719
of my loyalty,

612
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
please spare me.

613
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,199
Are you satisfied now?

614
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
You’ve seen Tidi.

615
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,199
And Fang Haishi is already dead.

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,119
If you really want to take revenge,

617
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,359
keep a close eye on Huangquan Pass.

618
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,880
Uncle,

619
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,319
that corpse

620
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,319
better be Fang Haishi's.

621
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,319
If one day I find out

622
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,760
it’s not his corpse,

623
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,120
Lanzi will be destroyed

624
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,399
the way he was.

625
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,159
Leave!

626
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,320
I knew your gender.

627
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:30,679
Don’t bother to find excuses.

628
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,399
When I

629
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,679
unpack you

630
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,679
little by little

631
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,800
as if unpacking a present,

632
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,280
I’ll know everything.

633
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,120
If I tell you

634
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,719
my identity,

635
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,560
can you tell me

636
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,919
who sent the message to you?

637
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Be patient.

638
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
When you become my wife

639
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,239
and the Davana of my tribe,

640
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,399
I’ll find the answer

641
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,560
to any question

642
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,439
you ask me.

643
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,679
I have no interest

644
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,919
in becoming your wife.

645
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,000
Because you’re a coward

646
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,199
who can’t keep his promise.

647
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,159
Also, I defeated you.

648
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,320
Go.

649
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:00,919
Go!

650
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:02,760
Go.

651
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,280
Follow up!

652
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,159
Go!

653
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,080
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

654
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,959
I guess all heroes are
in the Left Tribe.

655
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,159
In your tribe

656
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,280
are only liars.

657
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,919
You promised to release the prisoner

658
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,360
while you captured more.

659
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,000
You talk the talk,
but not walk the walk.

660
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,879
I promised you to release them.

661
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,800
But I never said

662
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
I wouldn’t capture other Jiamanese.

663
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,560
Let me ask you, then.

664
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,959
When will you release them?

665
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,479
When you’re willing

666
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,679
to marry me,

667
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,959
I’ll release every one of them.

668
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,959
Get me back to prison.

669
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,600
Never think about that.

670
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,520
Go back to my mansion with me.

671
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,239
I’ll marry you, no matter what.

672
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,159
- Quickly!
- Quickly!

673
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:01,959
Follow up!

674
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,600
Quickly!

675
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,800
Follow up!

676
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,159
Quickly!

677
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,840
- Quickly!
- Behave yourselves!

678
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,679
Go quickly.

679
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,639
Some more prisoners are coming.

680
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,959
Check if Haishi is among them.

681
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,959
You, go this way.

682
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,560
Quickly!

683
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,280
- Go!
- You two!

684
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,199
Come over! Get in!

685
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,040
You two, go that way!

686
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:14,840
Get in!

687
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:15,959
Quickly!

688
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,360
- Are you all right?
- Get up.

689
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,439
Behave yourselves!

690
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,719
Mr. Zhang?

691
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,360
Why were you captured, too?

692
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,520
Did you see Haishi?

693
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,719
I just came

694
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:30,000
to save him.

695
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:32,439
Go.

696
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:33,879
Come on.

697
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,199
I have a piece of important intel

698
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,199
and you must take it out.

699
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,159
Shall we

700
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,399
fight a way out?

701
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,280
No.

702
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,399
Lately, Lord of Right Pudun

703
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,360
may release some prisoners in batches.

704
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,679
Why not...?

705
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,360
You!

706
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,439
You mustn’t gather to talk!

707
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,399
Stay away from each other!

708
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,719
Miss Tidi,

709
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,280
these are awards from Lord.

710
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,639
Take them back.

711
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:19,600
I don’t want any.

712
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,239
Leave us.

713
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,120
Yes.

714
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,560
What?

715
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,919
You don’t like any of them?

716
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,919
If you want to please me,

717
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,959
you don’t need to play tricks.

718
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,120
Just put me back in prison.

719
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,320
You’re my girl.

720
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,000
Who dares to put you in prison?

721
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:40,959
I don’t want such a happy life

722
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,040
that you think it is.

723
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,800
I know I’m stuck

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,840
and I can’t escape.

725
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,959
But if you force me,

726
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,120
I’ll kill myself!

727
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,199
Don’t!

728
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,600
You’re a girl.

729
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,439
Why are you so bad-tempered?

730
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,320
If you want something,

731
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,080
just tell me

732
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,639
and I’ll grant you.

733
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,879
If you want me to listen to you,

734
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,120
do everything

735
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,239
you’ve promised me.

736
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,239
No problem.

737
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,199
I’ll have five prisoners
released immediately.

738
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,959
Ten.

739
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,479
Provide enough food

740
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,800
for the remaining prisoners.

741
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,600
They must be taken care of
if they’re sick.

742
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,679
No problem.

743
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,159
I promise you.

744
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,919
Fine. I’ll also promise you

745
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,719
I won’t kill myself lately

746
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,560
or run away.

747
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,879
But I request to have a free access

748
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,600
in Lanzi.

749
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,320
What?

750
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,479
You think I’ll break my promise

751
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,360
as you did?

752
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,080
Don’t worry.

753
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,239
Before all the prisoners

754
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,879
are released,

755
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,639
I won’t escape.

756
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,719
You’re Lord of Right Pudun.

757
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,800
Aren’t you even confident

758
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,040
to trap me?

759
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,399
Fine, then.

760
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,199
What else do you want?

761
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,439
Tell me.

762
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,040
The food you gave me...

763
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,280
I can’t finish it
and I don’t want to waste it.

764
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,760
Why don’t you

765
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
go to the prison with me

766
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,959
and give the food

767
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,399
to the prisoners?

768
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:03,679
Meanwhile,

769
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,239
I can check

770
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,479
if you will release

771
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,840
ten prisoners.

772
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,919
That’s good.

773
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,199
Not to mention the prison,

774
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:15,000
even if you want to visit
the capital of Dazheng,

775
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,840
I’ll go with you.

776
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,439
- Lord.
- Lord.

777
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,800
Hand out the food.

778
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,159
It’s the food Miss Tidi awards you.

779
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,919
Earlji is lucky in love affairs.

780
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,639
Look at this girl.

781
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:33,719
She’s so beautiful.

782
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:38,280
Give me one.

783
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Give me one.

784
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,280
I’d like one, too.

785
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,159
Give me one.

786
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:42,560
Give me one.

787
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,000
One, please.

788
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,080
One, please.

789
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,959
I’m going to release

790
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,239
ten prisoners.

791
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,840
Pick the weakest ones.

792
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,439
It’s a famine year because of snow.

793
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,360
Release them in case
of wasting our food.

794
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,760
- Yes, Lord.
- Yes, Lord.

795
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,120
Are you satisfied now?

796
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,760
They keep coughing.

797
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Maybe they have a strange disease.

798
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,159
We’d better leave now.

799
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,639
Why don’t you

800
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:11,600
release those two men, too?

801
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
Don’t let them infect others.

802
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,199
Release these two prisoners

803
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,719
in case they infect others.

804
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

805
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,760
Get out!

806
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,760
Get out!

807
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,479
Why didn’t you watch carefully

808
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,080
when you walked?

809
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,760
I didn’t mean that.

810
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,159
I didn’t mean that. Sorry.

811
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,639
You just need to pass the cipher

812
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,399
and someone will sneak in as a guard

813
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,439
so that he’ll send more messages

814
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,399
for Mr. Fang.

815
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,080
Sorry.

816
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,320
Are you sick?

817
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,280
What bad luck I have!

818
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,399
- Lord.
- Lord.

819
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,159
Lord.

820
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,320
This horse is dying.

821
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,320
Is there a post nearby?

822
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,239
Get another horse for me.

823
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,239
For your information,

824
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,199
there’s a store of the Secret Force

825
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,280
10 kilometers away.

826
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
One hour ago,

827
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,439
I sent out a message,

828
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,239
asking them

829
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,439
to bring us some fast horses.

830
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,360
They’re arriving soon.

831
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,159
Good.

832
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,080
Lord, your wound...

833
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,840
It’s all right.

834
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:34,679
Lord,

835
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:35,360
during our trip,

836
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,879
several horses have been exhausted.

837
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,320
And you’re still wounded.

838
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:39,600
You can’t keep traveling day and night,

839
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,399
or your wound may crack.

840
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,840
Let’s get to Huangquan Battalion first.

841
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,280
Then we’ll talk later.

842
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:05,600
Lord,

843
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,439
Fang Haishi’s identity has been exposed.

844
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,760
She’s trapped in the Governor’s Mansion

845
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:09,959
that Lord of Right Pudun seized.

846
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,879
I’m afraid they’ll get married.

847
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,600
Get the horse ready for me.

848
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,080
Yes.

849
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,199
According to Lord,

850
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:34,239
you can’t walk out of the mansion.

851
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,879
Let her out.

852
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,800
Yes.

853
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:39,000
Don’t worry.

854
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,679
I’ll do

855
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:41,959
whatever I promised you.

856
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,199
Take this token

857
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,919
and you’ll be free

858
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,080
in Lanzi.

859
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,679
No one dares to stop you.

860
00:42:59,439 --> 00:42:59,879
Lord,

861
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,959
Fang Haishi will certainly
go to the prison.

862
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,959
If she colludes with the prisoners

863
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:05,080
and sets traps,

864
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,840
it will...

865
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,600
The town is crowded with our warriors.

866
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,120
It’s not easy

867
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,399
if she wants to leave
with so many prisoners.

868
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,000
She’s a girl.

869
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,719
When she wants to do something,

870
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,199
why must I stop her?

871
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,760
Luerdan,

872
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,320
you took out a burnt corpse

873
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,719
and made Duoluo leave.

874
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,360
But remember.

875
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,040
I decide

876
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,600
whether I keep or kill Fang Haishi.

877
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,719
Yes.

878
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:41,760
Stop!

879
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,080
Open the door.

880
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,320
- My lady.
- Here she is.

881
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:57,760
- Here she is.
- We’ll have something to eat.

882
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:58,719
We’ll have something to eat.

883
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,760
Hand out the food to them.

884
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:00,520
Yes.

885
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,080
- Give me one.
- Give me one.

886
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,919
- Me!
- Thank you! Thank you.

887
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:06,159
- Give me one, please.
- Thank you.

888
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,199
You’ll all have some.

889
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:07,959
Give me one!

890
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:08,760
Thank you!

891
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,919
Give me some food.

892
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:10,840
Give me one.

893
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,959
Give it to me.

894
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,399
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

895
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:15,479
- Thank you, my lady.
- Thank you.

896
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:16,479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

897
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,239
- Give me one.
- Give me one.

898
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:18,879
Thank you.

899
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:19,439
Give me some.

900
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:20,040
Thank you.

901
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:23,879
We usually have light food.

902
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,199
Thanks to your pancakes,

903
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,919
or I’ll be too hungry to fall asleep

904
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,000
even until midnight.

905
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,520
Life is hard in prison.

906
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,760
How I wish I could go home tonight!

907
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:38,439
Then have more food.

908
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,199
I’ll be the lady

909
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,199
for a few more days.

910
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,800
I can protect you more or less.

911
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:44,040
You’re just lucky.

912
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,399
No common people are as kind

913
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,879
as our lady.

914
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:47,239
Yes.

915
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:48,520
Don’t bother to say that.

916
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,479
The pancakes we bought today are good.

917
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:52,679
Pancakes from the East Market

918
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,360
always have a lot of sesame.

919
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:56,520
But merchants out of the West Gate

920
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,760
use little sesame
and the pancakes are crispy.

921
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,840
When I break it, there are many crumbs.

922
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,840
No wonder they do poor business.

923
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,639
There are massive forces
in the east of Lanzi

924
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,080
while the West Gate is poorly defended
and can be easily attacked.

925
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,239
Report!

926
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:20,719
Lord.

927
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:21,719
Here’s new intel.

928
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:22,840
Give it to me.

929
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,040
According to the new intel,

930
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:44,800
Fang Jianming is heading
for Huangquan Pass.

931
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,520
Fang Jianming?

932
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,439
Lord,

933
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,919
on the Red Plain,

934
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,800
it was Fang Jianming

935
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,080
who made Princess Hongyao

936
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,879
die in chaos.

937
00:45:57,959 --> 00:45:58,800
Fang Jianming!

938
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,959
It was also him who made Huku

939
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,719
remain split into different tribes.

940
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,080
Is the intel accurate?

941
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,159
Did someone

942
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,360
fake the intel

943
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,800
so that he could trap us?

944
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,159
It’s the intel from Huangquan Pass.

945
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,159
This time,

946
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:12,399
it’s not the person

947
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,479
who told me that

948
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,280
Tidi was a girl.

949
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,439
I’ll have the intel verified.

950
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:18,479
If Fang Jianming

951
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,120
is really heading for us,

952
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,639
what do we do?

953
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:25,719
On the Red Plain,

954
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,800
Fang Jianming defeated me

955
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,239
and I ran away in a hurry.

956
00:46:30,479 --> 00:46:32,159
Things have changed.

957
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,000
Huangquan Pass is a natural barrier.

958
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:36,239
But you must understand.

959
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,719
Fang Jianming

960
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,360
also has scruples

961
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,560
about the alliance of all tribes.

962
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,840
He’s the enemy

963
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,399
of the entire Huku.

964
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,000
Go transmit my order.

965
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,239
Inform all tribes

966
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,760
of Huku immediately.

967
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,600
If they know

968
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,000
Fang Jianming is heading
for Huangquan Pass,

969
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,120
they’ll certainly work their way

970
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,919
towards Lanzi.

971
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:57,520
This time,

972
00:46:58,239 --> 00:46:59,639
I’ll definitely avenge myself

973
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,040
