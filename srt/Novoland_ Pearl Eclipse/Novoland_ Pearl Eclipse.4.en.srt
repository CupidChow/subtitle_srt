Mr. Fang!

Protect Princess!

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,960
Your Highness, go!

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,240
Run!

31
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,800
Your Highness!

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,880
Thank you for your help, General.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
It’s my honor.

34
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,039
I, Fang Haishi,

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,199
am late for protecting you.

36
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,440
Your Highness,

37
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,399
I didn’t protect you well.

38
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
Please punish me.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,039
You two are too serious.

40
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,279
Stand up, please.

41
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,279
Stand up, please.

42
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,359
Zhuoying.

43
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:17,399
You got hurt?

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,279
Nothing.

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,679
It’s only a scratch.

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,559
I wonder

47
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,000
where you got so many people?

48
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,239
So many?

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Just a few.

50
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,720
Run back and forth

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
to make it dusty.

52
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,000
You’re so tricky.

53
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,079
War allows deceit.

54
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,000
I learned it from you.

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,320
But I think

56
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,040
it’s just a temporary measure.

57
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,040
If the assassins

58
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,119
find it out,

59
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,160
we and our men

60
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,239
cannot defeat them.

61
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,519
Your Highness,

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
please set out immediately.

63
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
Why hasn’t anything happened yet?

64
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,480
Is it because of the bump on the way

65
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,399
or the climate?

66
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,839
Tell me.

67
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,679
Your Highness!

68
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,440
Your Highness,

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,040
Princess Tilan and her team are coming.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,480
Come on!

71
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,320
Let’s welcome her.

72
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

73
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,559
Greetings, Your Highness.

74
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,920
Don’t be too polite.

75
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,119
General Tang.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,720
Mr. Fang.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,880
I heard Princess Tilan and Mr. Fang

78
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,239
were attacked by assassins on the way.

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,200
I was so worried.

80
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,839
Luckily, the assassins

81
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,920
were not capable

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,079
and didn’t hurt you.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,119
Yes.

84
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,320
Princess Tilan wasn’t hurt.

85
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,440
Sorry for worrying you.

86
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,239
Your Highness.

87
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,320
No formalities.

88
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,200
You had a long journey.

89
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,079
I’ve prepared

90
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:12,799
camps and food

91
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,200
for Tilan and all of you.

92
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,399
Come on, please have a rest inside.

93
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,200
Great!

94
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,640
You’re more capable, aren’t you?

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,760
Princess of Zhunian is 1,000 miles away,

96
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,000
but you know everything.

97
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,559
I’m speaking to you. Look at me!

98
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,079
You really are a thankless eagle.

99
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:54,079
You dare to fly

100
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,839
and peck me in the eye.

101
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,239
You are too serious.

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,359
I dare not.

103
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,720
Do you think

104
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,399
it’s good for the Princess

105
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,399
to take her back to Tianqi City?

106
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,160
You’re hurting her.

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,200
Bring all your disciples

108
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,920
to the palace.

109
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,920
I met the one called Fang Zhuoying.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,839
You have another disciple, right?

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,600
Your Majesty,

112
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,679
it has nothing to do with them.

113
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,480
If the Princess

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,720
arrives at Tianqi City safely,

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
I’ll let you know

116
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,200
the consequence.

117
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,359
Zhuoying.

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,200
What?

119
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
The patrol is done?

120
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,480
What’s wrong?

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
We’ll arrive at Tianqi soon.

122
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,519
Why are you so unhappy?

123
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,279
We’ll arrive at Tianqi soon,

124
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,119
but I have a lot of butterflies

125
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,359
in my stomach.

126
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,440
If we bring

127
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,320
Princess Tilan back,

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
will Emperor Xu be furious?

129
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,559
What’s wrong?

130
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,760
When you saved her,

131
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,119
weren’t you so brave?

132
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,119
Are you afraid now?

133
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,760
I’m not worried about myself.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,959
I’m worrying about Princess Tilan.

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,559
His Majesty ordered us

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,119
to pick up the Fourth Prince

137
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,000
and Princess Tilan.

138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,440
Not us,

139
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,480
it’s me.

140
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,279
You came here on the sly.

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,760
I’m not afraid to be punished.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
I’m afraid

143
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,799
someone will take this as an excuse

144
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,679
to go against
Jifeng Pavilion and Master.

145
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,799
What to do then?

146
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,279
Haishi,

147
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,640
have you thought about that?

148
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,359
If we only pick up the Fourth Prince,

149
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,200
how will they tackle me,

150
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,119
Jifeng Pavilion and Master?

151
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,679
No.

152
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
Maybe it’s difficult.

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
If I only pick up the Fourth Prince,

154
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,799
The rivals

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,400
may still take me as an excuse

156
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,039
to tackle Master and Jifeng Pavilion.

157
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,239
It’s wrong either way,

158
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,960
so we’d better not think about it.

159
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,039
Young Master Zhuoying.

160
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,799
Young Master Haishi,

161
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,359
look who’s here.

162
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,599
Shaozi!

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Young Master Haishi,

164
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,320
Young Master Zhuoying.

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,799
Shaozi, are you coming to

166
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,440
take us back to Tianqi?

167
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,919
What did Master say?

168
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,679
Are you intending to ask

169
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,200
whether Commander was furious

170
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,440
for you left the pavilion

171
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,440
secretly?

172
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
He didn’t say anything.

173
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,000
But Jifeng Pavilion

174
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,400
only cares about the result.

175
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,520
On the trip to Xiping Port,

176
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,640
you protected the Princess.

177
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,479
It’s obviously

178
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,239
a merit.

179
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,679
So Commander asked me

180
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,919
to include you in the mission list.

181
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,599
Now,

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
your first mission

183
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,440
is coming.

184
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,280
How could Master know it?

185
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,159
I wrote what happened in recent days

186
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
to Jifeng Pavilion.

187
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,080
Well,

188
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,559
my new mission is...?

189
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,840
I’ll go with you.

190
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,000
Young Master Haishi,

191
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
The Fourth Prince

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,479
and Princess of Zhunian’s team

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,960
will enter Tianqi City soon.

194
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,559
Leave it to Young Master Zhuoying.

195
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,000
But your mission

196
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,719
is urgent.

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,200
We have to leave now.

198
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,479
The welcoming staff

199
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,719
are ten miles away.

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Nothing big will happen.

201
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,440
Leave it to me. Don’t worry.

202
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,599
Go ahead.

203
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,200
I’m leaving now.

204
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,119
Shaozi,

205
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,599
what’s the mission?

206
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
Deal with the rebel in the pavilion.

207
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,200
Is there a rebel?

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,400
Let’s walk and talk.

209
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,240
(Tianqi)

210
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,280
General Stabilizing the Army Su Ming,

211
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,119
my respects to the Fourth Prince.

212
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,559
Mr. Su.

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Here are His Majesty’s
oral instructions.

214
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,159
Her Highness

215
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,400
is invited to have a rest
at the courier hostel.

216
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,440
Your Highness, Mr. Tang

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
and Mr. Fang,

218
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,599
please go to the palace
to meet His Majesty.

219
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,559
Yes. Follow His Majesty’s instructions.

220
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:54,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

221
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,200
Here’s His Majesty’s order:

222
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,960
Jichang,

223
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,159
the fourth son of
the late Emperor Xiaozong,

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
and my brother,

225
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,760
is filial in nature,

226
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,400
and never does anything shameful.

227
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Since the beginning of his life,

228
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,960
he’s been doing so.

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,760
He was sent to Zhunian
for many years,

230
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,559
and contributed
to the country diligently.

231
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,919
This is to grant him

232
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,960
a title as Lord Chang.

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,359
That’s it.

234
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,559
Welcome Lord Chang to come back!

235
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,599
General Tang stays.

236
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
Others may leave now.

237
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:39,400
I haven’t seen Jichang for many years.

238
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,960
We’ll have a good chat.

239
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,200
We’re leaving now.

240
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

241
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:55,440
Jichang,

242
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,320
you have had a long journey.

243
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,760
There are no other officials left.

244
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,599
Don’t be too polite. Stand up.

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,239
I dare not.

246
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,080
Stand up.

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,200
Stand up.

248
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,239
Let me have a good look at you.

249
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,799
What’s this?

250
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,119
Your Majesty,

251
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,119
this is an eagle egg.

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,159
I heard that

253
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,599
if the owner

254
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,039
incubates the eagle egg by himself,

255
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,679
the little eagle

256
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,479
will treat him as its mother

257
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,479
and know his mind.

258
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,200
You like eagles.

259
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,359
No.

260
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,719
I’m good at nothing.

261
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,159
I just want to incubate

262
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,239
the best eagle in the world

263
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,919
to offer to Your Majesty.

264
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,799
Jichang,

265
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,599
you’ve done a lot for me.

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,719
In the battle of Tongping City,

267
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,479
if you hadn’t collected
provision in Leizhou

268
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,960
and provided supply for me,

269
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,679
the Rebellion of Prince Yi

270
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,919
would have taken two more years.

271
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
For all these years,

272
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,919
you sent me a lot of information

273
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,400
from Zhunian.

274
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
No, Your Majesty,

275
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,239
These are Mr. Tang’s contributions.

276
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,559
When you left the palace,

277
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
you were little.

278
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,919
We haven’t seen each other
for many years,

279
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,039
you must have

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,640
a blurry memory to me.

281
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I remember

282
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,239
when I left Dazheng,

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,679
you put some cakes

284
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,359
in my cart secretly.

285
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,880
I cherished and kept them.

286
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,479
Not long after,

287
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,880
because it’s hot,

288
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,559
the cakes had gone bad.

289
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,599
I had to

290
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,599
bury them under a Yulan tree.

291
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,359
Jichang,

292
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
in the past years,

293
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,760
we lost a lot,

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,080
but don’t worry,

295
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,119
the following days

296
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,320
will not be like before.

297
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
Since you come back to the capital,

298
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,719
I promise you.

299
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,280
I promise you

300
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,320
to obtain what you deserve.

301
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,679
Your Majesty,

302
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:11,000
I don’t want much.

303
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,960
I just want to

304
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,880
serve you

305
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,359
and enjoy family relationships.

306
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,440
General Tang also deserves credit.

307
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,840
I’ll promote you

308
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,719
as Chief Commander of Huangquan Pass.

309
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,919
Go fetch the plate.

310
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,239
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,080
Did you find out any news?

312
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

313
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,359
Mr. Tang and the Fourth Prince

314
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,520
went to meet the Emperor.

315
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,919
The Fourth Prince was labeled
as Lord Chang.

316
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:50,880
Mr. Tang was promoted as

317
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,000
Chief Commander of Huangquan Pass.

318
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,000
He’ll set out for

319
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,400
Huangquan Pass soon.

320
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,440
Zhenchu will go to Huangquan Pass?

321
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:58,559
Yes.

322
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,320
Mr. Tang is promoted.

323
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,479
I don’t understand

324
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
why Mr. Tang and the Fourth Prince

325
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,039
were asked to the palace,

326
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:05,880
only leaving our Princess

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,919
in the courier hostel.

328
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Zhunian and Dazheng
have always been friends.

329
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:09,919
Shouldn’t the emperor of Dazheng

330
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
meet our Princess

331
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,039
first?

332
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,239
Don’t talk nonsense.

333
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,280
It’s His Majesty’s mind.

334
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,200
How could we guess it?

335
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,719
Is everyone here?

336
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,280
It’s said so.

337
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,679
My respects, Your Majesty.

338
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,840
There is one missing.

339
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,320
No.

340
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,479
No one is missing.

341
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,119
You can’t count?

342
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,640
I counted.

343
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,719
It’s right.

344
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,919
Tell me the reason then.

345
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,719
He was Jifeng Pavilion’s disciple,

346
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,520
but now,

347
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,359
he’s not.

348
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,679
He took action at Jubei Town
without permission.

349
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,039
He was afraid to be punished,

350
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,039
so he escaped.

351
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,599
Really?

352
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,119
In your opinion,

353
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
when can Jifeng Pavilion

354
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,479
take him back?

355
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,680
We need some time.

356
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,599
You don’t fear my punishment?

357
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,400
I’ll accept it.

358
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,680
You’re too old

359
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,040
to bear it.

360
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,079
Messenger!

361
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,599
Take Fang Zhuoying

362
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:28,959
out

363
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,560
and beat his back 200 times with a cane.

364
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,280
Fang Zhu can witness it.

365
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,479
No matter he’s alive or dead,

366
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,439
the 200 beatings must be finished.

367
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,400
No, Your Majesty.

368
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,160
Zhuoying is Your Majesty’s subordinate.

369
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,400
If an emperor treats
his subordinates as brothers,

370
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,599
his subordinates
will treat him as master.

371
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,560
If an emperor treats
his subordinates as dirt,

372
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,520
his subordinates
will treat him as an enemy.

373
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,280
Don’t press me with those words.

374
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,599
In my opinion,

375
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,800
there’s no mutual trust
between emperor and subordinate,

376
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,439
only mutual torture.

377
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,439
Take him out. Beat!

378
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,520
No!

379
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,199
Zhuoying just followed my order.

380
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,439
If Your Majesty must punish him,

381
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,959
please punish me first.

382
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:13,959
I can beat you.

383
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,640
I can’t beat him?

384
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,239
Fine.

385
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,400
Since you want to

386
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,319
accompany him,

387
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,920
you’ll take the beating, too.

388
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,760
Take the two of them out!

389
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,319
11,

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,839
12,

391
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,680
13,

392
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,439
14,

393
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,680
15,

394
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,359
16,

395
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,800
17,

396
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,000
18,

397
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,000
19,

398
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,599
20,

399
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,160
21,

400
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,479
22,

401
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,839
23,

402
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,880
24,

403
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
25,

404
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,439
26...

405
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,760
Young Master Haishi, are you tired?

406
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,160
Shaozi,

407
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
we left in a hurry last night.

408
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,359
I didn’t make it clear.

409
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,520
On the way,

410
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,599
I got my thoughts straight.

411
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,160
Won’t you

412
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,400
tell me the truth?

413
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:46,800
What do you mean?

414
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,199
I don’t understand.

415
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,359
Master asked you and me

416
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,359
to catch the rebel of Jifeng Pavilion.

417
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:53,839
Yeah.

418
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,760
Do you have a picture?

419
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:57,959
Yes!

420
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,280
I burned it.

421
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,160
I remember it.

422
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,599
If he’s Jifeng Pavilion’s disciple,

423
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,280
how could you have a picture?

424
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,520
If you can’t explain it,

425
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,599
I’ll ask Master myself.

426
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,880
Young Master Haishi.

427
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,760
Although you’re

428
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,199
the young master of Jifeng Pavilion,

429
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,839
with our strength,

430
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:18,959
do you think

431
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:19,880
you can leave here easily?

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,719
You said,

433
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,040
I’m the young master of Jifeng Pavilion.

434
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,079
Since I’m Jifeng Pavilion’s disciple,

435
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
I should take my responsibility.

436
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,239
It’s not proper for me

437
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,520
to escape to Wanzhou.

438
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,439
It’s for your good.

439
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,719
I knew

440
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,000
it’s not easy to escape from

441
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,199
taking Princess Tilan back.

442
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,599
Anyway, please hide for the moment now.

443
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,359
All lands are the emperor’s.

444
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,280
Except that

445
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,079
I don’t go back to Dazheng this life,

446
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,199
or where can I hide?

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
I am humble.

448
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,040
I lost my father in childhood.

449
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,839
Master gave me a surname.

450
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:52,920
I am never

451
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,319
a greenhouse flower.

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,760
Since

453
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,680
the trouble is caused by me,

454
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,400
I have to take the responsibility,

455
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,719
whether I can or not.

456
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,319
I can’t leave it to

457
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,839
Master and Zhuoying,

458
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,839
and escape by myself.

459
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,520
87,

460
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,959
88,

461
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,760
8...

462
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,479
Your Majesty,

463
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,760
he fainted.

464
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,760
Your Majesty,

465
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,680
if it continues,

466
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,560
I’m afraid

467
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,079
he will die.

468
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
I will bear

469
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,319
the remaining for him.

470
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,599
Hold on, please.

471
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,880
Mr. Fang is hurt seriously

472
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,479
and his wound is bleeding.

473
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,680
It’s not proper to move him now.

474
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,839
Let me stop the bleeding first.

475
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,439
You can take him back then.

476
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,560
Thank you.

477
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,479
You’re welcome.

478
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

479
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,880
No formalities.

480
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,280
I have rewarded everyone
based on their contributions.

481
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,479
Mr. Su,

482
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,959
do you have anything to report?

483
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,119
Yes, we’re here to
ask for your instructions.

484
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,439
It seems you have discussed it.

485
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,599
Yes.

486
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
We discussed it in detail.

487
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,439
There is something

488
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,439
related to your marriage.

489
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,040
We need your instructions.

490
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,319
The first is about Princess Tilan.

491
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,319
Princess is noble.

492
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,599
She can’t live in the courier hostel.

493
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,719
Bring her to

494
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,959
the palace later today.

495
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,359
If she needs anything,

496
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,119
just prepare for her.

497
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,719
Your Majesty, you mean...

498
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,599
Isn’t it a ceremony that
she needs to enter the palace?

499
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,560
Without title

500
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,959
and wedding ceremony,

501
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,880
it doesn’t

502
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,079
conform to the rites.

503
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,239
Give her a title then.

504
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,560
Let her be

505
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:26,760
Consort Shurong.

506
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,800
Keep everything simple.

507
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,920
Your Majesty,

508
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:29,760
this...

509
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
What?

510
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,400
You have objections to my arrangement?

511
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,640
I dare not.

512
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,760
I’ll arrange it now.

513
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,800
Here’s His Majesty’s order.

514
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,920
Please take the order.

515
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,079
Tilan takes the order.

516
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,439
His Majesty’s order:

517
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,920
It is to grant Princess of Zhunian

518
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,520
from Clan of Corolti as Consort Shurong.

519
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:56,079
Please enter the palace immediately.
Keep everything simple.

520
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:57,239
That’s it.

521
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,839
Your Highness,

522
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
the emperor of Dazheng

523
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,439
is obviously looking down upon Zhunian.

524
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,560
Your Highness,

525
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
you have to make a decision.

526
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,719
Chief Commander of Huangquan Pass
Tang Qianzi asks for a meet.

527
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,599
Greetings, Your Highness.

528
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,439
Your Highness,

529
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,040
I heard that

530
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,640
you’ll enter the palace.

531
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,560
Why does the order

532
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,000
come so urgent?

533
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,319
Is the emperor of Dazheng

534
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,680
dissatisfied with me

535
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,640
or Zhunian?

536
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,319
Your Highness,

537
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,160
you must pull yourself together.

538
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,079
Leizhou is in a mess now.

539
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,520
Nihualuo

540
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,520
and Tuhuolu

541
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,680
covet Zhunian wickedly.

542
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
Zhunian always relies on Dazheng

543
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,599
and His Majesty.

544
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,599
The palace is full of risks,

545
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,280
and His Majesty is capricious.

546
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,680
You must learn from the Princess Zizan

547
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,359
and win His Majesty’s love,

548
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,560
you know?

549
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,839
I know what you said

550
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
is for my good.

551
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,640
Your Highness,

552
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,479
protocol officer and servants
from the palace are coming.

553
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,000
Let them in.

554
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,959
We’ll go to the palace.

555
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,160
Where are Master and Zhuoying?

556
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,280
Young Master Haishi,

557
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Commander and Young Master Zhuoying

558
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,680
went to the palace
according to the order,

559
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,359
and haven’t come back yet.

560
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,040
Master.

561
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,359
Master.

562
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:21,079
Zhuoying.

563
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,760
Zhuoying.

564
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,079
Master,

565
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,359
what happened to Zhuoying, Master?

566
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,119
Master,

567
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,000
it’s my fault.

568
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,479
Could you please let me

569
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,359
look after Zhuoying tonight?

570
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,400
When he’s recovered,

571
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,920
you can punish me as you want.

572
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,079
Don’t bother.

573
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,640
Leave now.

574
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,920
Where do you want me to go?

575
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,839
Leave Jifeng Pavilion.

576
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
You can go wherever you want.

577
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:50,880
Master!

578
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,680
Leave now.

579
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,439
Master,

580
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,280
Zhuoying was beaten up this time

581
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,479
because of me.

582
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,079
Emperor Xu

583
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,880
punished Zhuoying

584
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,680
definitely because we

585
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:01,760
took Princess Tilan

586
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,160
back.

587
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,079
He’s transferring his anger. Master.

588
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,439
There must be something fishy.

589
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,800
If those people

590
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,599
were not dispatched by Emperor Xu,

591
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,160
they must hide

592
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,239
in the wedding procession

593
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,239
or among the officials

594
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,040
in Xiping Port.

595
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,719
If you think it can’t be over

596
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,319
with me here,

597
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,719
you can bring me to the palace.

598
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,719
I can tell Emperor Xu face to face.

599
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,239
You call His Majesty Emperor Xu.

600
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,760
You think you’re
not eye-catching enough?

601
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,119
I ask you to leave

602
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,160
not because I’m afraid
you’ll be involved,

603
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,040
but because you are too naughty.

604
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,599
You refuse to correct your errors,

605
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,640
and always turn a deaf ear to my order.

606
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,560
Leave Jifeng Pavilion.

607
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,040
I respect you.

608
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,199
I always follow

609
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,880
what you said.

610
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,760
Even if you ask me to die here now,

611
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,599
I won’t refuse it.

612
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,719
But Master,

613
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,760
could you please allow me

614
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,760
to look after Zhuoying tonight?

615
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,400
Tomorrow morning,

616
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,239
I will leave here.

617
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:16,920
Commander.

618
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,359
Come in.

619
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,920
Commander.

620
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,520
Young Master Zhuoying is placed well

621
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,520
and sleeping now.

622
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,479
Young Master Haishi stays with him

623
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,439
and never leaves.

624
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,000
He has affection for Zhuoying.

625
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Let it be.

626
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,680
Tomorrow morning,

627
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,079
how to deal with Young Master Haishi?

628
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,199
Please give me instructions.

629
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,199
You stay too long with them

630
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,199
and forget the rules?

631
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,560
I see. Follow the rules.

632
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:56,839
Go ahead.

633
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,359
Yes.

634
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,920
You call His Majesty Emperor Xu.

635
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,439
You think you’re
not eye-catching enough?

636
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,239
I ask you to leave

637
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,520
not because I’m afraid
you’ll be involved,

638
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,800
but because you are too naughty.

639
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,319
You refuse to correct your errors,

640
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,199
and always turn a deaf ear to my order.

641
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:56,480
(Memorial tablet of Dazheng’s Queen,
Tianqi’s Saintess from Clan of Corolti)

642
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,319
Where are you going?

643
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,760
See a ghost?

644
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,199
No, Your Majesty.

645
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,319
I see Your Majesty

646
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,800
is drinking,

647
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,280
I want to

648
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,160
get a plate of pickled plums

649
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,280
for you.

650
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,760
You’re so considerate.

651
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
I will reward you.

652
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,400
Give you 100 beatings

653
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,239
to treat your

654
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,160
disease of lying and flattery.

655
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
Your Majesty is wise.

656
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,839
I...

657
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,599
In front of Your Majesty,

658
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,520
I’m a crystal glass,

659
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
crispy.

660
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,520
One kick of yours

661
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
will make me

662
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,079
broken.

663
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,839
Speak what you want.

664
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,880
Your Majesty,

665
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:08,000
Consort Shurong

666
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,760
is waiting for you outside.

667
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,280
Without your order,

668
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:14,479
she’s been standing there till now.

669
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,160
Ask her in.

670
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,239
Ask Consort Shurong in.

671
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,079
I’m from Clan of Corolti of Zhunian.

672
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,520
My respects, Your Majesty.

673
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,959
Bad manners!

674
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,920
You only see me.

675
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,760
Don’t you see the queen?

676
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
(Memorial tablet of Dazheng’s Queen,
Tianqi’s Saintess from Clan of Corolti)

677
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,479
Zi...

678
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,560
How dare you!

679
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,839
You think you can still

680
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,000
be protected by Zhunian?

681
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,560
I’m Tilan,
from Clan of Corolti of Zhunian.

682
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,719
My respects, Your Majesty,

683
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:21,760
Your Highness.

684
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,319
Meeting the emperor with a veil

685
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,839
is the rule of Zhunian?

686
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,119
According to Zhunian’s custom,

687
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,880
I am already Your Majesty’s wife.

688
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,359
At the first meeting,

689
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,640
I should remove the veil

690
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,400
in front of Your Majesty.

691
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,800
Boring.

692
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,320
What’s that?

693
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,479
Your Majesty,

694
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,360
this is an auspicious object

695
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,520
from my motherland.

696
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,199
Since I got it in my childhood,

697
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
I’ve been wearing it.

698
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,080
Zhunian’s king

699
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,560
made a lot of efforts this time.

700
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,840
What’s your name?

701
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,560
Tilan.

702
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Tilan.

703
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,479
You look

704
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,840
just like your sister,

705
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,120
and you have what she had.

706
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,439
But you’re not Zizan!

707
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,439
In the whole world,

708
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,320
there is only one Zizan!

709
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,639
You’re just a fake.

710
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,919
Fake!

711
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

712
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,439
Your Highness.

713
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,399
Your Highness,

714
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,760
His Majesty is busy today.

715
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,560
What about

716
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
you go have a rest at Yu’an Palace?

717
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,919
Go! Go! Get out!

718
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,840
Without my order,

719
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,719
don’t leave Yu’an Palace a step.

720
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,439
Here’s His Majesty’s order.

721
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,639
Fang Zhu, please kneel to take it.

722
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,639
Lord,

723
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,159
our lord

724
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,679
is tired today.

725
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,560
He’s sleeping now.

726
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,760
Would you

727
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,560
please...

728
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,840
His Majesty’s order:

729
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,959
Ask Fang Zhu to take it immediately.

730
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,959
Wake him up if he sleeps.

731
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,959
Let him kneel and have a good look.

732
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,080
Tell him
I ask him to watch it together.

733
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,080
I did what he wanted.

734
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,239
Does he dare to
refuse to do what I want?

735
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:36,120
These are what exactly His Majesty said.

736
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,760
If anyone refuses to deliver my order,

737
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,239
tell these words

738
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,719
to the people of Jifeng Pavilion

739
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,560
to avoid feeling awkward.

740
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:44,320
Lord.

741
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,800
Shaozi,

742
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,080
I’ll go tell Master.

743
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,919
Master.

744
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,719
Master.

745
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,280
Master! What’s wrong with you, Master?

746
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,000
You were beaten up, too?

747
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,159
Master.

748
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,159
Master.

749
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,000
Master.

750
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,080
Sorry to disturb you

751
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,520
so late, Mr. Fang.

752
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,199
Here’s His Majesty’s order.

753
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,639
Please kneel to take it.

754
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,320
His Majesty asked us

755
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,120
to send you a picture of Consort Shurong

756
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,639
and ask you to watch it together.

757
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,040
Please kneel and have a good look.

758
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
I can’t see it clearly.

759
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,320
Let me see it with light.

760
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,159
This is Consort Shurong?

761
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,159
Yes.

762
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,800
Did you see it clearly?

763
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,679
I didn’t see it clearly.

764
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:51,320
I will kneel here till dawn

765
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,879
to watch it clearly.

766
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,560
Master.

767
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,679
What picture is it?

768
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,000
Why ask a seriously wounded person
to kneel to watch it?

769
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,800
Shut up!

770
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,360
Master…

771
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:05,639
Leave here.

772
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,800
Mr. Fang,

773
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,479
His Majesty prepared a

774
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,479
1,000-year-old silver ginseng for you.

775
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,760
I will send it to you tomorrow.

776
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
Farewell, Mr. Fang.

777
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,639
Those people who

778
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,439
take the pain of the flesh seriously

779
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
is lucky,

780
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,320
because they possibly never

781
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
lost anything important to them.

782
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,239
These years,

783
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,320
there is one thing that

784
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
I have been thinking
over and over again.

785
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,800
During the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

786
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,600
if I wasn’t blinded

787
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,639
by the hatred of my family,

788
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,199
and didn’t ask my army to encircle him,

789
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,360
I wouldn’t have caused Zizan’s death.

790
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,760
Would she and Emperor Xu have

791
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,679
a complete home?

792
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:19,919
Would their kid

793
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,679
be all right?

794
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,760
But there is no way

795
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,520
back.

796
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,719
I can help Emperor Xu to obtain

797
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,520
the whole world,

798
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,320
but

799
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,520
I can’t return him

800
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,159
his beloved woman.

801
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,840
Did you have any dessert?

802
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,080
Why are you laughing?

803
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,959
In the wedding night,

804
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,080
no bridegroom

805
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,360
will ask the bride

806
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,439
this question.

807
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,560
They are all

808
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,479
eating and drinking outside,

809
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,840
only you are waiting for me here.

810
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I’m afraid you’re hungry.

811
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,120
I’m afraid your crown is too heavy.

812
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,800
I’m afraid you wait for me for too long.

813
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,159
Are your wedding customs

814
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,439
the same as here?

815
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,360
Zhunian’s wedding customs

816
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,840
are different from Dazheng’s.

817
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,000
In Zhunian,

818
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,439
a girl will wear

819
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,320
a veil made of 18 kinds of silk threads

820
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,040
for the wedding,

821
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,239
and remove it in front of her husband

822
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:56,560
to show her face.

823
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,199
A veil made of 18 kinds of silk threads?

824
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,320
Anyway,

825
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,399
I’ve married Your Highness now.

826
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,439
I should follow

827
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,399
the customs of Dazheng.

828
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,760
But this Dragon Tail Pendant

829
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,239
is the

830
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,560
badge of the Clan of Corolti.

831
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,520
I’ve been wearing it since my childhood.

832
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,560
So I’m also wearing it today.

833
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,959
What are you laughing at?

834
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,000
I’m thinking

835
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,040
if you remove the

836
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,199
veil made of 18 kinds of silk threads

837
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:30,800
in front of me,

838
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,840
you must look beautiful.

839
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,159
I hate it.

840
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,040
I hate it.

841
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,239
Leave me alone.

842
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,679
It’s my fault.

843
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,879
Go back now.

844
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,520
Master.

845
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:16,840
Master.

846
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:18,399
Master.

847
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:19,760
Master.

848
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,919
The sun is rising, Master.

849
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,040
Master.

850
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,600
Master!

851
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,199
Master!

852
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:35,919
Anyone, help!

853
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:37,159
Master!

854
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,239
Anyone, help!

855
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:43,560
Master.

856
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,399
Go get some clean water.

857
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:06,479
OK. Throw this away.
