(Commentary Rules)
Today’s exam is commentary.

26
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,525
The topic should be

27
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,566
the current politics and events.

28
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,530
Please feel free to write down

29
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:27,736
your comments

30
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,430
for His Majesty’s advice.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,725
Talkers and cheaters

32
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:32,800
will be evicted.

33
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,750
Untidy papers

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,960
will not be reviewed.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,839
The commentary

36
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,559
has to be finished in one hour.

37
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,250
Any delay will be deemed a waiver.

38
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,800
The exam starts now.

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,399
The pearl tax is levied by His Majesty.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,479
Without pearls,
you’ll have to be slaves!

41
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,520
Those who refuse to comply

42
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,484
will be regarded as rebels!

43
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,850
(On Pearl Tax)

44
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,325
On the east of Yuezhou is the sea.

45
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,160
Thirty miles away from the coast,

46
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,960
merfolks live

47
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,400
in the sea like fish.

48
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,369
They weep

49
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,919
pearl tears

50
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,440
and have sharks protect them.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,425
Blood agitates the sharks

52
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,240
which can swallow a boat.

53
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,150
Since the tax was levied,

54
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,600
local authorities multiplied the amount

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,375
to cater to their superiors.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,239
The harvest cannot meet the demand.

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,880
So local men push their children

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
in the sea with a rope
tied to their waists

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,450
to lure the merfolks to the surface,

60
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,119
and then strangle the children.

61
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,519
Merfolks are kind creatures.

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,040
They’d shed tears,

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,119
which with the help of wind,
become pearls

64
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,640
that shine at night.

65
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,600
My father was killed by sharks.

66
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,119
Months later,

67
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,371
the neighboring village was slaughtered.

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,239
In the southeastern prefectures,

69
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,950
the situation could be worse.

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,359
People die every year.

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
And every year pearl harvest
is in deficit.

72
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,839
People die for pearls.

73
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,335
They’re more precious than lives.

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,621
Why?

75
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,679
The ruler is blind

76
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
and has no mercy.

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,361
Misrule is more devastating

78
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,171
than surging waves and sharks.

79
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,175
Sir, I’ve completed it.

80
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:18,965
Already?

81
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:30,415
Alright, you may leave.

82
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,279
The ruler is blind

83
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,799
and has no mercy.

84
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,040
Misrule is more devastating

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,720
than surging waves and sharks.

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,329
How impertinent!

87
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,679
Your Majesty is a wise emperor.

88
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,279
Your Majesty and the officials

89
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,600
are like a deeply

90
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:53,040
bonded family.

91
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,799
Hence we can give our advice

92
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,119
freely to Your Majesty

93
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,719
and achieve peace and stability.

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,119
Peace and stability?

95
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:05,200
Your Majesty’s wisdom is
for the world to see.

96
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,959
This man defiles Your Majesty.

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,289
Probably being ordered to.

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,440
Being ordered?

99
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:15,145
Are you implying

100
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,760
that the topic of this exam
was disclosed?

101
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,399
If it was disclosed,

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,640
as the Grand Examiner,
you’re responsible.

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,259
It wasn’t disclosed.

104
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,480
It was pure speculation.

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Please forgive me.

106
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,320
I think

107
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:50,375
his article and idea are profound,

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,399
except that the handwriting

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
is like a woman’s.

110
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,325
Anyway, I’ll give him the first place.

111
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,959
Your Majesty.

112
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,961
Mr. Su,

113
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,559
you handed it to me

114
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,900
because you couldn’t

115
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,250
decide, right?

116
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,119
Are you challenging my decision?

117
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,359
I wouldn’t dare.

118
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:16,204
You’re all

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,560
in high ranks.

121
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,230
You talk about governance

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,421
and are paid by the people.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,100
You proclaimed to serve the people.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
But now what?

125
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,160
Explain the ruthless

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
exploitation!

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,160
Do you deserve

128
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,720
the people’s trust?

129
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,799
What is

130
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,799
my pearl tax policy?

131
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,575
Who can tell me?

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,799
Prefect of Yuezhou, Lyu Ke,

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,200
tell me.

134
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:02,480
Your Majesty,

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
it wasn’t long after the Rebellion
of Prince Yi.

136
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:07,065
To regain national strength,

137
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,920
Your Majesty ordered pearl tax
to be levied

138
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,959
to collect 1/10
of a bumper year’s harvest…

139
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,079
Louder!

140
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,200
Your Majesty ordered pearl tax
to be levied

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,040
to collect 1/10
of a bumper year’s harvest…

142
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,959
subject to the people’s will.

143
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,079
It is known as a tax,

144
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,959
but in fact, it’s barter.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Right.

146
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,839
Then how did it

147
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,200
evolve to exploitation?

148
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,080
Prefect of Baiyi Bay, Ding Zhiwei,

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,239
explain it!

150
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,320
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,679
I have no idea.

152
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:44,986
No idea?

153
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,280
Alright!

154
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,271
Let me tell you how!

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
After the tax was effected,

156
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,520
instead of implementing it as a barter,

157
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,919
you multiplied the amount.

158
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,239
In my name,

159
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,840
you charged 10 or even 100 times!

160
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,799
Those villages

161
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,080
which couldn’t afford it

162
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
were burned to the ground,

163
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,799
and the villagers, men and women alike,

164
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,425
were tied to anchor chains

165
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,640
and taken to autumn markets

166
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,679
to be sold as slaves to Hanzhou.

167
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,359
To pay the pearl tax, villagers

168
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,320
took their children out to sea

169
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,000
as baits to collect pearls!

170
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,000
Am I correct?

171
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,425
Through taxes,

172
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,119
you milked the people dry

173
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,359
for private interest and kept me
in the dark!

174
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,760
Were it not for this commentary,

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,119
I wouldn’t have

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,150
known this despicable truth!

177
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,520
Associate Justice Yao Jie!

178
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,475
Yes.

179
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,239
I order you to go to Yuezhou immediately

180
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,239
and investigate the southeastern
pearl tax corruption.

181
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,799
Lyu Ke and Ding Zhiwei,

183
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,625
prefects of Yuezhou and Baiyi Bay,

184
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,239
neglect their duties and deceive
their emperor.

185
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,039
Put them in the Imperial Prison
pending trial!

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,159
Your Majesty!

187
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,599
- Mercy, Your Majesty!
- Pardon me!

188
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,320
Mercy, Your Majesty!

189
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,159
Your Majesty!

190
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,960
- Mercy, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty! Pardon me!

191
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,925
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

192
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,280
- Mercy, please! Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

193
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:14,950
(Ranking List of Imperial Commentary
First Place Fang Haishi)

194
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,479
The rankings are out!

195
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,440
In this commentary,

196
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
the first place,

197
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,210
conferred by His Majesty,

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,525
is Fang Haishi.

199
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,960
The second place, He Chong.

200
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,410
The third place, Zhuo Yifan.

201
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:40,799
Fang Haishi,

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,320
your commentary on pearl tax

203
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,280
has started

204
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,150
an uproar in court.

205
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,675
His Majesty thought highly of you.

206
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:50,644
A bright future awaits you.

207
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,184
If you find your names on the list,

208
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,236
you’re in for the next test.

209
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,320
Those whose names aren’t on the list

210
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,320
can pack up and leave

211
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,875
the Imperial Examination Hotel
immediately.

212
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,075
The next round of examination

213
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,960
is scheduled in 5 days.

214
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,039
In 3 days

215
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
from today,

216
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,375
the hotel will be closed
for maintenance.

217
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,440
All candidates

218
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,925
are free to go on your own itinerary.

219
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,239
Congratulations.

220
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,960
Congratulations, Fang.

221
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
Congratulations! Congratulations!

222
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,200
It’s pure luck.

223
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,440
Let’s all do our best

224
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,880
in the next few rounds.

225
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,359
You were most instructive the other day.

226
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,760
I was being rigid.

227
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,919
Congratulations, Fang,
on the first place!

228
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,919
Congratulations, Fang,

229
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,239
on the top commentary.

230
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,520
What did you comment

231
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,919
that caught His Majesty’s eye?

232
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:43,559
Nothing particular.

233
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:44,925
Hey, Fang! Come on!

234
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:45,760
- Just tell us.
- Fang!

235
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,300
Fang!

236
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,479
Haishi!

237
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,479
Way to go!

238
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,440
The first place

239
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,300
conferred by His Majesty!

240
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,925
Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,189
Where is Master?

242
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,520
Master?

243
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
In the Palace, I guess.

244
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,300
More work?

245
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,825
Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,880
Come on.

247
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,799
Let’s go have a feast

248
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,599
to celebrate it.

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,400
Your Majesty.

250
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,550
Do you know why you’re summoned?

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,320
Yes.

252
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,010
It’s about the pearl tax corruption.

253
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,669
You knew it long ago.

254
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:19,919
So why did you

255
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,960
keep me in the dark

256
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,400
as they did?

257
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,450
Consort Shurong isn’t

258
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,320
the only reason
Fang Haishi wants me dead.

259
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,000
It’s also
about the pearl tax corruption.

260
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,305
It was ill-considered

261
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,359
not to report the corruption

262
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,679
to Your Majesty.

263
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,280
In recent years,

264
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,121
I’ve been investigating in secret

265
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,119
and I’ve gathered ample evidence

266
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,599
of officials’ corruption

267
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,640
in southern coastal prefectures.

268
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
And I’ve found where the pearls went.

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,921
The evidence is sufficient.

270
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,719
It’s time to bring them to justice.

271
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,479
You didn’t tell me until now?

272
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,000
Fang Jianming,

273
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,239
are you trying to play with power?

274
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,960
As Your Majesty once said,

275
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,105
I’m your right-hand man,

276
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,520
your humble servant.

277
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,119
You misunderstand me.

278
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,960
Whatever you say.

279
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,275
I’ve ordered the Grand Justice

280
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,600
to investigate it.

281
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,760
Since you’ve been working on it,

282
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:14,799
go with Yao Jie

283
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,919
to Yuezhou.

284
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,640
The ongoing Imperial Examination

285
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,559
brought unidentified people
to the capital.

286
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,000
I think it’s better I stay

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,719
in the capital

288
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,719
to ensure your safety.

289
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,880
I’ve ordered

290
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,880
Zhuoying to go on the trip to Yuezhou.

291
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,450
Fang Jianming, do you

292
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,559
take pleasure

293
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,125
in challenging my decision?

294
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,479
I do everything

295
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,599
for the sake

296
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,050
of Your Majesty’s safety.

297
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,675
For me?

298
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,880
I think you’re afraid

299
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,650
I’d hurt Fang Haishi

300
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,770
while you’re away.

301
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,159
Your Majesty is a wise emperor.

302
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,919
Don’t flatter me as they do.

303
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,325
You’re poor at it.

304
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,280
It sounds weird from you.

305
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,225
Anyway,

306
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,479
I should be grateful

307
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,400
to Fang Haishi for this.

308
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Were it not for him,

309
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:01,100
I don’t know

310
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
how much longer I’d be kept in the dark.

311
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,029
What’s that awful thing?

312
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,880
The Fabric Office’s embroideries

313
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,039
shouldn’t be that poor.

314
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:12,960
It seems

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,119
Ju Qiqi is no longer

316
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,359
qualified for her job.

317
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,359
It’s not the Fabric Office’s embroidery.

318
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,675
Not its embroidery?

319
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,625
(Fang)

320
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,559
It’s so ugly.

321
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,719
Ugly and funny.

322
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
Is it the embroidery of a man?

323
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,565
I think it’s good.

324
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,225
The court

325
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,300
has never been peaceful.

326
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Except you,

327
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,320
who else can I trust?

328
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:51,559
I heard about your commentary
on pearl tax.

329
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,199
You really got some guts.

330
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,200
I was worried about you.

331
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,320
I just told the truth.

332
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,159
As Master’s doctrine,

333
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,239
do whatever you know is right.

334
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,799
If we couldn’t even tell the truth,

335
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,200
it would be impossible
to do the right things.

336
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,719
But in my opinion,

337
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,280
you-know-who

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,479
is something of a diligent ruler

339
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,640
despite his temperament.

340
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,719
From what I see,

341
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,479
he could be a great emperor.

342
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,280
Don’t jump

343
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,875
to any conclusions

344
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,355
so soon.

345
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,520
Has Master

346
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,115
read my commentary on pearl tax?

347
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,440
Even His Majesty doesn’t
find it offensive.

348
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,479
Master surely will back you up.

349
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,958
So no worries about getting a reprimand.

350
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:38,395
He didn’t say anything?

351
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,020
I couldn’t tell

352
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:44,479
anything

353
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
from his reaction.

354
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,200
What’s in your hand?

355
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,175
I…

356
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,760
(Fang)
I broke your

357
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,719
jade pendant,

358
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,279
so…

359
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,280
so I made this for you.

360
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:27,475
(Fang)

361
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,861
By the way,

362
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,200
I haven’t had a chance to ask.

363
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,919
Was everything alright

364
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,999
in the Imperial Examination Hotel?

365
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,024
Yes, everything was fine,

366
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,000
except that it was

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,721
always clamorous and stinky.

368
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,549
It’s typical for a bunch of men.

369
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,550
They don’t wash their feet,

370
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,039
and they talk in dreams. Pretty normal.

371
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,200
Unlike you

372
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,479
who are so neat.

373
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,039
Are you saying

374
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,075
men are all like

375
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,400
pigs in stinky pens?

376
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:55,925
Mm-hmm.

377
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:57,880
Yes, exactly.

378
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,335
But not Master.

379
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,100
Mm-hmm.

380
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,119
Also right.

381
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,894
Mm-hmm.

382
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,925
Master is different from other men.

383
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,759
He’s more like…

384
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,839
more like

385
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,040
a gentle and knowledgeable scholar.

386
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,199
Don’t expect

387
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,000
every man to be like Master.

388
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,250
I couldn’t help

389
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,079
with those men

390
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
being stinky.

391
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,199
What else

392
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,920
can I help except that?

393
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,560
Just tell me.

394
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,560
I’m going to Yuezhou in a few days.

395
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,319
By then I won’t be of any help.

396
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,200
Yuezhou?

397
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,800
Mm-hmm.

398
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,011
The revelation of pearl tax corruption

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,561
in your commentary

400
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,999
shocks the court.

401
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,920
His Majesty ordered

402
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,520
the pearl tax deficit
of southern coastal

403
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,959
prefectures to be investigated.

404
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:44,880
Rest assured.

405
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,800
Master

406
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,760
has gathered evidence

407
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,775
to those officials’ corruption

408
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,599
long ago.

409
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:49,760
Your hometown

410
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
will resume prosperity soon.

411
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
What

412
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,439
does this have to do with Master?

413
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,239
Since Master brought you in,

414
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,319
he has had men

415
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,880
investigate it.

416
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:01,640
In case it alerts
the corrupted officials,

417
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,560
the investigation
has been kept a secret.

418
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,920
You’re fully in accord

419
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
with Master

420
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,760
in this report.

421
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,850
(Jifeng Pavilion)

422
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,119
Master.

423
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,119
Morning, Master.

424
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,650
Welcome back.

425
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,040
I came back yesterday.

426
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,959
You were away.

427
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
I’m in hurry.

428
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,640
So I forgot your sachet.

429
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,359
It doesn’t matter.

430
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,839
Just a plain little something.

431
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,725
And it’s terrible.

432
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,359
I understand.

433
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,940
Master,

434
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,920
did you read my commentary?

435
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,750
Yes, I did.

436
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,340
The archery and riding test
is in a few days.

437
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,689
You’ve been excellent in it.

438
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,640
Make me proud.

439
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,425
Mm-hmm.

440
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,079
Yes, Master.

441
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,000
Thank you.

442
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:32,926
Master.

443
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,520
Master.

444
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:36,825
Morning.

445
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:39,760
What happened to you?

446
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,070
Rough night?

447
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,425
Huh?

448
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,725
No.

449
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:45,599
Liar.

450
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,451
You have dark circles around your eyes.

451
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,400
You’re too eager to win.

452
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,591
Relax.

453
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:53,314
I…

454
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:54,640
I was twining string

455
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,775
around the ring last night,

456
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,719
because it’s a little big for me.

457
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,560
I thought I should adjust its size

458
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,680
because it’s a personal accessory.

459
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,319
I was inconsiderate.

460
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
It was my ring.

461
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,319
I should have given you a new one.

462
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,079
No, no, no.

463
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,425
I like it.

464
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,319
Because as long as it’s yours,

465
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,719
however trivial it is,

466
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,800
it’s precious to me.

467
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,319
It’s almost time for the test.

468
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,049
Don’t be late.

469
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,550
Candidate Fang Haishi.

470
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,959
The horse.

471
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,119
What’s wrong? The horse is jumpy.

472
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,100
What’s going on?

473
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,319
To rein your horse,

474
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:43,479
you have to know

475
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,439
his temperament as well

476
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:45,800
as you know yours.

477
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,079
Find out if he’s unhappy,

478
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,050
sad,

479
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,640
or the contrary.

480
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,239
It’s essential.

481
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,150
But Master,

482
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,040
how can I tell?

483
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,319
Adjust yourself.

484
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,200
Adjust yourself to the horse.

485
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,400
Don’t be afraid.

486
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,959
The horse will sense fear,

487
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,959
but you have to stay calm.

488
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,479
If you remain calmer

489
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,400
than your horse,

490
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,925
it will follow

491
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
your lead

492
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,920
as an arrow goes the way

493
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,325
you want it to go.

494
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,560
Amazing!

495
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:26,199
Wow!

496
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,160
Fang is impressive!

497
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,040
This is awesome.

498
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:28,800
Yes!

499
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,199
One day if we go to the battlefield,

500
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,719
I would like to follow his order.

501
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:33,239
I would like to work for him

502
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,800
as his deputy.

503
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes, so would I.

504
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,119
He’s great.

505
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:40,485
In the archery and riding test,

506
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,400
the first place is

507
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,164
Fang Haishi.

508
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,719
Fang,

509
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:46,450
our congratulations in advance.

510
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,839
On what?

511
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,760
You’re too modest.

512
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,119
I’m sure you’ll be the first place
in all tests.

513
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,719
Yes.

514
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,640
We’re sure about it.

515
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,119
You’ll get the laurel.

516
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,175
The four of us

517
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,280
would like to serve you

518
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:56,199
and follow your orders.

519
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,560
Yes, last time,

520
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,359
we thought you had connections,

521
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,439
- so…
- Alright. Drop it.

522
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:00,719
Anyway, we’ve decided

523
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,880
to follow your lead.

524
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,839
I’m glad

525
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,839
to have you.

526
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,560
However, you have to listen to me.

527
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,959
- Sure. It’s a deal.
- Sure.

528
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,160
We’re brothers from now on.

529
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,680
Don’t address me by rank.

530
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,599
I can’t stand it.

531
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,225
Sure.

532
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:13,599
Can we call you our brother?

533
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,400
Right.

534
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,280
Sure.

535
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:16,575
Brother!

536
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,000
Commander.

537
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,119
How did it go?

538
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
It’s a win, despite a blip.

539
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:30,079
Haishi is impressive.

540
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,280
However,

541
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
something is wrong with the horse.

542
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I’ve ordered it

543
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,439
to be checked in secret.

544
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,359
Behind the mad horse

545
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,011
are probably some mad men

546
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,825
and a mad master.

547
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,280
The priority now

548
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,680
is the final test

549
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,920
which His Majesty will present.

550
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,199
What’s more,

551
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,400
if Haishi makes his mark

552
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,359
in the test,

553
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,800
His Majesty will

554
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,400
give him a post.

555
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:58,680
Those men may be mad,

556
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,875
but they’re certainly not stupid.

557
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,239
This is his only chance.

558
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,344
Are you saying that

559
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,760
our enemy will strike again

560
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,239
in the final test?

561
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,424
Some people

562
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,481
are about to disgrace themselves
this time.

563
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,000
Commander,

564
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,239
what should we…

565
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,000
Arrange everything else.

566
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,214
I’ll be there in the Palace Examination.

567
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:22,319
I would like to see

568
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:24,455
what’s wrong with those men

569
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,850
by sabotaging us over and over again.

570
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,359
Yes.

571
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:39,525
(Yu’an Palace)

572
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,525
- Mr. Fang.
- Mr. Fang.

573
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,079
Please report for me

574
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,400
that Bowmen Commandant Fang Zhuoying

575
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,680
seeks Her Highness’s audience.

576
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

577
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,075
Mr. Fang,

578
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,599
it’s been days. Is everything alright?

579
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,520
Everything is fine.

580
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,520
My brother has been concerned

581
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,160
about the broken Dragon Tail Pendant
of yours.

582
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
So he asked me

583
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,680
to bring this bead bracelet he obtained

584
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,880
at Baiyun Temple to Your Highness.

585
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,825
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,675
Please send my gratitude to him.

587
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,000
Is he alright?

588
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,000
He’s fine.

589
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,599
My brother has been caught

590
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,839
in the Imperial Examination.

591
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:43,439
I heard he ranked the first

592
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,800
in two exams.

593
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,270
I’m happy for him.

594
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,319
My brother said

595
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,275
if it’s to Your Highness’s liking,

596
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,680
you can keep this rabbit.

597
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,959
So cute!

598
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,800
Does it have a name?

599
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,000
My brother asked me

600
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,160
to buy it at the fair.

601
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,000
It’s not named yet.

602
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:13,800
There’s nothing special in Yu’an Palace.

603
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,040
So I will pray for Mr. Fang Haishi

604
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,520
every day and every night.

605
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,560
May I ask?

606
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,479
Do all girls

607
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,000
like rabbits?

608
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:30,626
They’re cute.

609
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,971
I don’t think anyone would loathe them.

610
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,439
Mr. Fang,

611
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,640
are you going to give a rabbit

612
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,920
to someone?

613
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
No, no.

614
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,199
Your Highness,

615
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,520
I’m on duty in the Palace.

616
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,199
If that’s all,

617
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:47,520
I should leave.

618
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,920
Give my gratitude to your brother.

619
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,680
I appreciate his gift.

620
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,079
Yes.

621
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,599
The Mr. Fang Haishi

622
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,160
is such a thoughtful man.

623
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,169
May he succeed in the examination,

624
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,239
so his grace

625
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,800
can benefit the people.

626
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,560
Alright, it’s noon.

627
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,275
You can go have lunch.

628
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,239
Zheliu,

629
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,520
aren’t you coming with us?

630
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:29,599
I’ll stay and clear it up.

631
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,680
You go.

632
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,040
Alright.

633
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:35,479
Let’s go.

634
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,400
Come on.

635
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,560
Zheliu,

636
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,675
I’ll keep the lunch for you.

637
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,439
Mm-hmm, thank you.

638
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,225
Mm-hmm.

639
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let’s go.

640
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,199
Come on.

641
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,319
Where does the rabbit come from?

642
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,600
I don’t see any strangers today.

643
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:24,199
Is it a gift from the God of Wind?

644
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,239
Dear Bunny,

645
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,439
I haven’t worshiped

646
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,680
the God of Wind today.

647
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,280
Let’s make pomegranate

648
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,119
flower cakes for the God of Wind,

649
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,000
alright?

650
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,525
I’m starving.

651
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,479
Haishi, it’s me.

652
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,675
I heard you came back.

653
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:14,439
If you’ve turned in,

654
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,199
I’ll go.

655
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,920
Zhuoying, I’m up.

656
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,580
Hey, you’re back.

657
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,560
Well done!

658
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,599
I heard you came in first

659
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,319
in the Palace Examination.

660
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,920
You must be so proud now.

661
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
You’re quite right.

662
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,439
By the way,

663
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,719
I’m going out tomorrow night

664
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,199
and I’ll leave for Yuezhou the next day.

665
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,200
Would you like to bring something

666
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,079
to your mother?

667
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,839
Just a moment.

668
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:41,400
Zhuoying.

669
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,050
Mm-hmm.

670
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,439
Here is some gold.

671
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:45,000
My mother

672
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,239
returned it every time

673
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:47,800
I mailed too much to her.

674
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,479
And,

675
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,719
a few words for her.

676
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,000
She’s illiterate.

677
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Please read it for her.

678
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:53,199
You can count on me.

679
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:54,805
Hold on.

680
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,525
I smell something from you.

681
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,160
What do you smell?

682
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,890
I washed my feet today.

683
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,775
It’s a sweet smell.

684
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,400
Look what it is.

685
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,150
Smells good? It looks good too, right?

686
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,000
Thank you, Zhuoying.

687
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,560
Haishi!

688
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,599
Give it back to me!

689
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,400
This tastes good.

690
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Stop eating!

691
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,239
Haishi!

692
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,239
Why can’t I?

693
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,375
I’m going to slap you!

694
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,439
You’re going to slap me
for merely a cake?

695
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,830
It’s not merely a cake.

696
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,275
Really?

697
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:33,359
It’s not an ordinary cake?

698
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,319
No!

699
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,529
It…

700
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,634
It smells like pomegranate flowers.

701
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,400
Did an embroiderer

702
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,439
of Fabric Office make these?

703
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,960
Cut it out.

704
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,200
I bought them

705
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,439
in a pastry store.

706
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,300
Really?

707
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Which one? I also want to buy some.

708
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,280
Why should I tell you?

709
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,475
I won’t tell you.

710
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:01,760
Fang Zhuoying.

711
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,359
Hmm?

712
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,319
You’re blushing.

713
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,599
You have a crush on someone

714
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,560
and you’re shy.

715
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,359
Ask Master’s help to propose to her.

716
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,511
Nonsense!

717
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,811
Don’t be mad.

718
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,741
Here are three left. Take them.

719
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,399
Oh…

720
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,080
It’s late.

721
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,040
I should go.

722
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,800
Go to bed.

723
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,400
I’ll treat you to liquor
when you come back.

724
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,839
Don’t bother.

725
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,500
- The cakes are delicious.
- Just don’t drive me crazy.

726
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,880
The usual free combat?

727
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,200
What’s good about fighting in pairs?

728
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,239
Besides,

729
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,481
it’s unfair to pair candidates up

730
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,600
by drawing lots.

731
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,760
If two strong candidates form a pair,

732
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:55,439
one of them will have to go.

733
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,000
Doesn’t it benefit the weak candidates?

734
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,599
It’s possible that

735
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,000
through this selection,

736
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,239
the winner could be

737
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,920
a hunk who excels
in physical confrontation.

738
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,420
I’m not looking for a muscle,

739
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,080
but a commander.

740
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:13,075
We’ll discuss it further.

741
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,199
Never mind.

742
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,680
When you work out another proposal,

743
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,841
it’ll be too late.

744
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,520
I’ll make a plan

745
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,959
and set the theme.

746
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:26,550
What the state needs

747
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,319
are accomplished men

748
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,000
who can write

749
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,680
and also fight.

750
00:33:33,439 --> 00:33:34,479
What I want

751
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,640
is an army

752
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,239
and naval leader.

753
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:41,325
So,

754
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,775
pick a large piece of water

755
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,150
and make relevant arrangements.

756
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,119
Xiaoguai, slow down.

757
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
The Mr. Fang Haishi

758
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,959
is so thoughtful.

759
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,199
Bizi, look.

760
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,280
Since we entered

761
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Dazheng territory,

762
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,280
Her Highness hasn’t smiled.

763
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,119
Since Mr. Fang Haishi’s rabbit came,

764
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,920
Her Highness found her smile back.

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
Help me out.

766
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,436
What should I

767
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,910
gift Mr. Fang Haishi for his kindness?

768
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,925
What should we gift him?

769
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:21,000
Your Highness,

770
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
in my humble opinion,

771
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,294
there’s no rush.

772
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,555
Private gifts are not allowed
in the Palace.

773
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,919
We could return his favor

774
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,000
when he wins the Palace Examination

775
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,199
as our congratulation.

776
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,120
That’s more proper.

777
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,300
Mm-hmm.

778
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,890
Your Highness,

779
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,520
you haven’t made a decision

780
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,199
on the patterns

781
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,679
for your dress Zheliu of Fabric Office

782
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,399
brought over.

783
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,360
Would you like to pick one?

784
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,120
So I can send them back

785
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
to the Fabric Office in a while.

786
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,879
Sure.

787
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,850
Xiaoguai,

788
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,010
go play on the lawn.

789
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:58,575
Wow!

790
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,199
(Embroidery Catalogue of Fabric Office)
Zheliu has amazing hands.

791
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,375
The flower patterns are so vivid.

792
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,560
This one.

793
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:12,700
Mm-hmm.

794
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:14,676
As for the color,

795
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,120
ask Zheliu

796
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,300
to decide for me.

797
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,560
Yes.

798
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,570
I’ll remember it.

799
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:31,184
Where is the rabbit?

800
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:34,825
Xiaoguai!

801
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,760
I levied one pearl tax.

802
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,490
But those men

803
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:42,479
put a large amount

804
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,679
in their own pockets

805
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,280
under my nose.

806
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,840
Calm down, Your Majesty.
Please be careful of your health.

807
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,560
You should be careful

808
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,959
of your own life.

809
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,439
If you bend the law

810
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,159
for anyone involved
in pearl tax corruption,

811
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,150
your wife and children

812
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,250
will have to meet you at your grave
next spring.

813
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,650
Yes, Your Majesty.

814
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,850
I’ll enforce the law as it is

815
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,159
and eradicate corruption.

816
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,025
You may leave.

817
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:12,800
Where does the rabbit come from?

818
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,700
Xiaoguai!

819
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,000
Xiaoguai!

820
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,000
Xiaoguai!

821
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,199
So it’s her rabbit.

822
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:22,919
Xiaoguai!

823
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:31,425
Stop.

824
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,740
Come here.

825
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,509
Greetings, Your Majesty.

826
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,439
Forgive my impertinence, Your Majesty.

827
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,030
I’ll ground myself

828
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,280
in Yu’an Palace

829
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
and reflect on my behavior.

830
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:16,274
Did I allow you to leave?

831
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,279
Come forward.

832
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,959
You went to Baiyun Temple.

833
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,769
Your Majesty must be joking.

834
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:38,596
As a consort,

835
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,700
I cannot go out without permission.

836
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Besides, I’m from another state

837
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
and know little about the capital.

838
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,600
I don’t even know about Baiyun Temple.

839
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Well, I’m curious

840
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,080
where the bead bracelet comes from.

841
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
As far as I know,

842
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,360
only Baiyun Temple

843
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,560
can make such bead bracelets.

844
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,840
They make bracelets every year.

845
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,800
But its number is limited.

846
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,480
Not everyone can get it.

847
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,600
If it’s not someone concerned,

848
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,080
why would he or she

849
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,950
try so hard to get a blessed
bead bracelet for you?

850
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,360
When I found

851
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,199
the bead bracelet,

852
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:17,925
it was with other objects.

853
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,360
Perhaps it came with

854
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,560
other daily things from the treasury.

855
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:25,425
The treasury.

856
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,159
Forget it.

857
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,849
The treasury has a colossal stock.

858
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:35,120
It takes time to check its ledger.

859
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,409
Maybe the bead bracelet

860
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,439
did belong to the treasury.

861
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,879
But the rabbit

862
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,439
couldn’t possibly jump

863
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:47,719
out of the treasury ground, could it?

864
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,730
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

865
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,520
The rabbit

866
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:53,919
is a gift from a servant

867
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,439
to kill time when I’m bored.

868
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,760
If Your Majesty doesn’t like it,

869
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:57,800
I will have it

870
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,879
taken away.

871
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,360
A bore-killer from a servant?

872
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,000
But I think

873
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,120
someone who cares

874
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,900
gave this bead bracelet

875
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,339
and the rabbit to you.

876
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,840
I’ll give you another chance.

877
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,840
Tell me the truth.

878
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,679
I won’t blame you.

879
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,520
In addition,

880
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,750
I’ll allow you

881
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,800
to keep it in Yu’an Palace.

882
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,625
It seems the rabbit

883
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,320
and the bracelet

884
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,225
are from someone important

885
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:43,425
to my Consort Shurong.

886
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,725
Fine.

887
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,679
Let me guess.

888
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,919
Tang Qianzi?

889
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,726
It’s not him.

890
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,325
Right.

891
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,850
He and the procession had left

892
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,225
for Huangquan Pass.

893
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:03,450
Right now

894
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,970
they must have arrived.

895
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,760
Who else?

896
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,625
Fang Haishi.

897
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,925
This man does have guts.

898
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:25,744
In the Imperial Examination,

899
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:26,800
he wrote a critical

900
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,239
commentary that gave me

901
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,439
quite a hard time.

902
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,520
In the meantime,

903
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,959
he could come and go

904
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,320
to your Yu’an Palace freely.

905
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:35,775
Consort Shurong,

906
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,525
do you know

907
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,479
what crime it is

908
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,639
to engage with court officials?

909
00:40:47,975 --> 00:40:50,416
If Your Majesty thinks I’m guilty,

910
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,070
I am guilty though I’ve done
nothing wrong,

911
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:55,444
not to mention that

912
00:40:56,025 --> 00:40:57,745
I have done things wrong.

913
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,425
Tell me

914
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,770
what you’ve done wrong.

915
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,749
For one thing,

916
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,040
I cannot make Your Majesty happy

917
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,239
as a consort.

918
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,360
For another,

919
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,760
I keep a rabbit in secret

920
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,919
against the palace rules.

921
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:15,120
Thirdly,

922
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,679
I get an official involved

923
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,879
in my misdemeanor.

924
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,399
As punishment,

925
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,360
I’d like to swear with my life.

926
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,360
But

927
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,410
this is truly irrelevant to anyone else.

928
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,959
I can’t believe that’s how you are.

929
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:36,199
You look amicable and poor,

930
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:39,550
but inside, you’re unyielding.

931
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,399
Fine.

932
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,950
Let’s see

933
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,760
how great

934
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:48,840
the innocent official is.

935
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,840
If he fails

936
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,679
to get the first place
in Palace Examination,

937
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,919
I think

938
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,770
there’ll be no reason to keep him alive.

939
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,231
Your Majesty!

940
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
Well,

941
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,239
you give up denying
it’s not Fang Haishi.

942
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,879
It’s getting

943
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:06,120
more and more interesting now.

944
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,534
The Palace Examination is tomorrow.

945
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,719
I have a whim

946
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:14,380
to ask for your company.

947
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,900
General.

948
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:34,800
Come and check this.

949
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,120
The theme His Majesty

950
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,199
set for tomorrow’s Palace Examination.

951
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,625
All candidates

952
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:47,320
are required to fight on drums

953
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,199
and then mount the wood columns.

954
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:51,875
This is a map of the drums.

955
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,500
Remember it,

956
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,800
so you can

957
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,679
move freely tomorrow.

958
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,280
I’ve remembered it.

959
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,275
Mm-hmm.

960
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,520
These are ice needles.

961
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
And they are poisoned.

962
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,320
A scratch

963
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,719
will be enough to kill.

964
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,879
Take these to the Palace Examination

965
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,479
as your weapons.

966
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,639
They’ll thaw once they’re in the body.

967
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,159
His Majesty and all reviewers

968
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,239
will be far away.

969
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:24,919
As long as you’re discreet,

970
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:27,320
no one will be suspicious.

971
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,600
I will shoot the needle

972
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,560
at the critical point

973
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:32,760
on Fang Haishi’s neck

974
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,879
and kill him.

975
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,280
You’d better do that.

976
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,280
Master.

977
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:53,919
Come in.

978
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:01,885
Master,

979
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,719
I watched all night

980
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,879
and intercepted this eventually.

981
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,840
As you predicted, Master,

982
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,959
someone from the court

983
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:10,040
is writing to suspects of corruption

984
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,439
in southeastern coastal prefectures.

985
00:44:12,175 --> 00:44:12,800
Go.

986
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:14,120
The Grand Justice and his men

987
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,199
probably will reach the city gate soon.

988
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:17,200
When you arrive at Yuezhou with them,

989
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:19,320
just hand over the evidence

990
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,040
and return to the capital immediately.

991
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,080
Avoid any delay.

992
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,080
Yes.

993
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:24,840
Master,

994
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:26,425
it’s the Palace Examination today.

995
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,919
Doesn’t His Majesty

996
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,360
ask Shaozi to keep guard?

997
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,040
Judging by your outfit,

998
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,080
are you going on duty, Master?

999
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,250
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,959
Well, you’re disobeying

1001
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:36,800
a direct order of His Majesty.

1002
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,159
Well, it’s not

1003
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:39,675
the first time I disobey his orders.

1004
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,400
Haishi’s safety is the priority now.

1005
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,239
You must go. Don’t wait any longer.

1006
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:45,560
Yes.

1007
00:44:45,675 --> 00:44:46,475
Goodbye, Master.

1008
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:54,239
Your Majesty,

1009
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,669
it’s about the blissful time.

1010
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,760
Wait.

1011
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,350
Oh.

1012
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:06,896
Your Majesty,

1013
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,201
Consort Shurong is here.

1014
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:10,364
Invite Her Highness in.

1015
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,349
Good day, Your Majesty.

1016
00:45:58,679 --> 00:45:59,800
Your Majesty.

1017
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:03,596
Let’s go to Shuangping Lake.

1018
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:07,475
