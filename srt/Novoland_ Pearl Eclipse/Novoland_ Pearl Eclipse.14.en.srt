25
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,000
Master, you wanted to see me?

26
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:27,880
Sit down.

27
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,240
Send this confidential letter

28
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,279
to Miss Ju in person.

29
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,279
Previously I asked you
to fill the vacancy

30
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,360
of the lost informers.

31
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,559
This matter will be
in the charge of her.

32
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,039
You want Miss Ju

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,800
to take charge of the informers?

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,039
You can’t do that.

35
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,119
Just do as I told you.

36
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,399
Huku raided the Well Town

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,039
without warning this time.

38
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,479
It could be someone

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
plotting something.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,759
It’s a big thing.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,119
If you let it go,

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,919
I’m afraid...

43
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,800
It’s His Majesty’s will.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,639
We must obey the order.

45
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,160
Since it’s His Majesty’s will,

46
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,520
I have to do it.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,479
But Haishi just
arrived at Huangquan Battalion.

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
I’m worried

49
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,479
that if we change the informer,

50
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,399
we won’t get

51
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,080
any news about him.

52
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,119
Not only

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,880
will we get no news about him,

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,880
there are many other things

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,440
that will cause real strains.

56
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,880
Master.

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,039
Is there no room

58
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,119
for maneuver?

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,279
I see.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
It’s just

61
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,000
you were

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,160
communicating with Miss Ju in person

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,559
about the informer.

64
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,199
I’m a subordinate

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,199
and a junior.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,119
If I go...

67
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,919
His Majesty asked me
to hand over this job.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
I obeyed his order.

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Don’t worry about anything else.

70
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,720
Just look out and see

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,600
if anyone is

72
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,240
keeping an eye on the Fabric Office.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,800
Let me know

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,919
if you notice anything strange.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,839
Yes, Master.

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,920
(Fabric Office)

77
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,960
What should I do?

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,559
I can’t ask anyone else

79
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,839
to send this confidential letter.

80
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,519
It’s too hard.

81
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,160
Forget it.

82
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,640
Zheliu doesn’t know

83
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,040
I’m the God of Wind
she has been talking about.

84
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
I might as well just walk in.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,119
Zheliu.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
Miss Ju asked us

87
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,640
to get cloth from
the Imperial Manufactories at this time.

88
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,079
What does she want to do?

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,679
Miss Ju must have her own reason.

90
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,959
Let’s be quick.

91
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,880
Zheliu.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,279
What should we eat for dinner?

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Let’s get the work done first

94
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,559
before thinking about dinner.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,720
But I’m

96
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,880
a little hungry now.

97
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,119
Mr. Fang. Sorry to keep you waiting.

98
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,200
Greetings to Miss Ju.

99
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,559
Let them go to rest.

100
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Miss Ju.

101
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,440
His Majesty

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
ordered Jifeng Pavilion

103
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,799
to hand over

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
the renewal of informers in Hanzhou

105
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,679
to you.

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,359
Master has put

107
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,160
all the previous information

108
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,760
in this confidential letter.

109
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,359
Please read it.

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,399
If you

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,119
have any questions,

112
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
feel free to ask me.

113
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,399
Mr. Fang.

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,160
I can barely

115
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:52,239
see anything.

116
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,079
How can I read this confidential letter?

117
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,079
I was being thoughtless.

118
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,839
I will read the confidential letter

119
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,519
for you in detail.

120
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,480
Mr. Fang. As for the handover,

121
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,239
Lord Qinghai could have

122
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,839
summoned me to Jifeng Pavilion.

123
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,239
He doesn’t need to bother you

124
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,880
to make a special trip.

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,600
Miss Ju.

126
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,160
Master doesn’t mean anything.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
It’s just...

128
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,359
He’s just not feeling well.

129
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,519
He’s ill.

130
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
So he sent me here.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
Please don’t take it personally.

132
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
Not feeling well?

133
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes.

134
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,440
Don’t push me.

135
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,160
I’m not pushing you.

136
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,239
- You are pushing me.
- Excuse me.

137
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Look out, my water lantern.

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,399
- Excuse me.
- Come on, put it here.

139
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
I’m done.

140
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,359
- Look out.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,880
Why are you floating water lanterns?

142
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:50,880
After His Majesty

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
went back from Shuangping Lake that day,

144
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,480
Consort Shurong stayed
in Jincheng Palace

145
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,399
for the whole night.

146
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,519
His Majesty

147
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
never favored anyone
in the past few years.

148
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,359
There is something special
about Consort Shurong.

149
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah.

150
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,839
We’re here

151
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,640
to get some good luck.

152
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,000
Excuse me.

153
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,519
- Excuse me.
- Place it here. Place it here.

154
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,679
- I’ll put it here.
- Are you done?

155
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
- Slowly.
- I’m finished.

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,559
The southwest area

157
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,399
is still not peaceful.

158
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,519
The pearl tax corruption
has just been solved,

159
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,640
now there are pirates in Xiping Port.

160
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,679
Some people just hate to see me

161
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,320
live an easy life.

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
It’s not like these pirates started
to attack Xiping Port

163
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,760
in these years.

164
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,160
In the early years, they went ashore

165
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,160
to plunder people and then disappeared.

166
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,839
Chen Heran has been stationed
in Xiping Port for years.

167
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,760
He got a way to deal with them.

168
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,760
But now these pirates

169
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,600
have been around for a while

170
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,679
and launching attacks continuously.

171
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
I think they are up to something else.

172
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,239
I’ve analyzed the battlefield reports.

173
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,119
With the information
provided by our spy,

174
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,559
I’m sure

175
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
they are probing

176
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
for the weakness
in Xiping Port’s defense.

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
Just as Your Majesty said,

178
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,119
I think these guys are soldiers

179
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,559
of Nihualuo and Tuhuolu.

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
These Leizhou people

181
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,760
are getting bolder now.

182
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,200
They invaded many times,

183
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,040
but I don’t think they planned it.

184
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,519
It’s the Huku people who instigated it.

185
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,959
It worked along

186
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,519
with Huku’s attack of Huangquan Pass.

187
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,760
One in the north and one in the south.

188
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,839
How is the handover

189
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,480
of the renewal

190
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,760
of informers in Hanzhou?

191
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
I’ve sorted out the material

192
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,040
and given it to Miss Ju.

193
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,720
It’s on fire!

194
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,480
It’s on fire!

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,959
Help!

196
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,119
What’s the noise?

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
It’s on fire!

198
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
Go to check it now.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,039
Your Majesty.

200
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
Why are you in such a panic?

201
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,919
We were floating water lanterns
by the lake

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,159
and it caught fire.

203
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
It’s not a holiday today.

204
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,520
Why would you float water lanterns?

205
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,840
Speak now.

206
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,599
People in the Palace said

207
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,119
that Consort Shurong
was favored by His Majesty

208
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,400
because she floated water lanterns
by the lake.

209
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,479
We also

210
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,960
want to get some good luck.

211
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:01,840
Ridiculous!

212
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,280
Mu Deqing.

213
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,039
Yes.

214
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,239
They talked about my consort in private.

215
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,559
How should I punish them?

216
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,799
Twenty floggings.

217
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,880
Those who floated water lanterns today

218
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,719
will be given twenty floggings each.

219
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
Anyone

220
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,039
who dares to float water lanterns
on Shuangping lake again

221
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,039
will be given thirty floggings.

222
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,119
Repeat offenders will be put in jail.

223
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Yes.

224
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,239
Take them away.

225
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
- Mercy, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

226
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,520
- Your Majesty!
- Mercy, Your Majesty!

227
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,039
- Take them away!
- Mercy, Your Majesty!

228
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,280
Your Majesty!

229
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,679
Your Majesty.

230
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,080
Just some water lanterns caught fire.

231
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,400
Fortunately, it was on the lake.

232
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,559
The fire has been put out.

233
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,520
I see.

234
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,440
I’ll leave the southwest

235
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,359
to you.

236
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,640
As for the north,

237
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,880
don’t worry about it.

238
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,919
Yes, Your Majesty.
I’ll have to excuse myself.

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Urgent news!

240
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,039
Urgent news!

241
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,880
Urgent news!

242
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,359
Are you all right?

243
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,280
It’s urgent news.

244
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,119
Forget about me.

245
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,239
Urgent news!

246
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
Hurry! Urgent news!

247
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,159
- Urgent news!
- Hurry!

248
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,799
(Tianqi)
Urgent news!

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,280
Urgent news!

250
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:28,919
Ridiculous!

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,880
They pretended to be pirates
who invaded the coast

252
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,679
and probed the actual situation,

253
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,679
but the fact is their ships
are hiding on the sea.

254
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,039
Nihualuo and Tuhuolu’s

255
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
wild ambition

256
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,799
is abundantly clear!

257
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,000
Your Majesty.

258
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,039
I’m willing to lead troops to stop them

259
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,200
and defend our territory.

260
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,520
Su Ming.

261
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,159
You’ve been leading troops for years,

262
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
but you are not familiar with the coast.

263
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,479
Yeah.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,239
Even we send in army,

265
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,799
it’ll be in vain because they don’t know
how to fight on water.

266
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,000
Your Majesty.

267
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,159
Xiping Port

268
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,799
is the barrier to the southwest coast.

269
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,719
If Nihualuo and Tuhuolu

270
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,760
open the gate to the southwest,

271
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,640
I’m afraid it will be
out of our control.

272
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,119
What’s your opinion, Lord Qinghai?

273
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,359
Your Majesty.

274
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,359
I want to give it a try.

275
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,679
As for the sources of troops,

276
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,599
Liushang Troops
have been growing food these years.

277
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
There is no depletion of numbers.

278
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,039
We are willing to serve Your Majesty.

279
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,000
Right.

280
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,400
There are still
Lord Qinghai’s Liushang Troops.

281
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,400
Lord Qinghai is loyal indeed.

282
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,239
Lord Qinghai followed Your Majesty

283
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,320
to pacify the enemy back that time.

284
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
He won every battle he fought

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,919
whether it was on water or on land.

286
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,200
Now that we have Lord Qinghai,

287
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,080
Xiping Port will be safe and sound.

288
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,880
That’s great.

289
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,159
Lord Qinghai.

290
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,719
You are in full charge

291
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,239
of this operation.

292
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Set off immediately.

293
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

294
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,760
Master.

295
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,960
The situation at Xiping Port
is dangerous.

296
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,359
Now you are going there,

297
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,960
are you sure you won’t

298
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,960
take me with you?

299
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,559
No matter how dangerous Xiping Port is,

300
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,919
can it threaten the throne?

301
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,719
You mean...?

302
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,479
The capital and Xiping Port,

303
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,640
which is more important?

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,960
I see.

305
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,440
Always put

306
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,599
His Majesty’s safety first.

307
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,200
When I’m not in the capital,

308
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,080
you and Shaozi must be on the alert
day and night

309
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,599
and keep His Majesty safe.

310
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,520
And also,

311
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,440
look out

312
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
if anyone is watching the Fabric Office

313
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,679
and doing anything

314
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,320
to the informer line in Hanzhou.

315
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,679
Master, be careful on your way there.

316
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,119
Rest assured.

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
I’ve sent a message to Liushang Troops.

318
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,159
Liushang is near the west.

319
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,520
I’ll join the main force first

320
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,880
and then head for Xiping Port.

321
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,520
I won’t fail in my mission.

322
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:05,679
Staff Officer.

323
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,960
Is General Tang in the camp?

324
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,679
Yes, I’ll report to him.

325
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,400
Don’t bother.

326
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,760
Yes.

327
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,239
General Tang.

328
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,559
Mr. Fang, are you here

329
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,520
because you have something important
to discuss with me?

330
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:25,599
Yes.

331
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,599
I found

332
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,280
that after the Well Town battle

333
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,520
ten days ago,

334
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,640
the two thousand
escaped soldiers of Huku

335
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
disappeared completely
at Huangquan Pass.

336
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,880
There’s no trace of them.

337
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,520
I found it very strange.

338
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,719
These two thousand people
have to eat and drink,

339
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,000
and be camped somewhere.

340
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,960
No matter how carefully
they hide themselves,

341
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,479
there still should be a clue.

342
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,159
Mr. Fang, that’s also

343
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,200
what I’m thinking.

344
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,799
There is no news

345
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,119
from our spies in Huku.

346
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,400
I’ve sent men outside

347
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,320
to check it out.

348
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,880
But so far, no results have been got.

349
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:56,919
I was looking at the map

350
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,719
and thinking

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,960
that the road to the glacier is blocked.

352
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,320
They can’t go back.

353
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,559
Where are they hiding?

354
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,159
I’m just worried

355
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,520
that the Well Town battle

356
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,200
is just a trap of the Huku people.

357
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,440
I’m afraid

358
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,159
there is a bigger threat to come.

359
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,039
You are absolutely right.

360
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,919
If Huku takes the chance

361
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,880
and launch an attack now,

362
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,679
I’m afraid the people
inside Huangquan Pass

363
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,840
will suffer.

364
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,880
I’ll send more people out

365
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,159
to inspect around.

366
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,799
I want to take a small team

367
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,359
to Well Town and find it out.

368
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
You are a Staff Officer.

369
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,000
You don’t need to work so hard.

370
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,919
Leading soldiers to fight is your job.

371
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,000
Huangquan Pass
is the lifeblood of Dazheng.

372
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,799
It’s my job to protect

373
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,280
the people inside Huangquan Pass

374
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,080
from the Huku people.

375
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,880
General Tang,

376
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,479
please grant my request.

377
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,000
It’s rare to see someone
so conscientious like you.

378
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,559
You can take a team

379
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,359
with you to go outside.

380
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Yes.

381
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,400
Hold on.

382
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,000
A snowstorm is coming.

383
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,080
It’s gobi desert

384
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,159
outside the Huangquan Pass.

385
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,159
There are also broken hills.

386
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,000
The Huku people
are ferocious and violent.

387
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,640
It’s best to be careful.

388
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,799
Thanks, General Tang.

389
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,200
General.

390
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,679
It’s getting cold.

391
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,039
Put on a coat.

392
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,599
When do you think

393
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,359
the raven

394
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,760
will arrive at Xiping Port?

395
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,520
I don’t know when the raven

396
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,880
will arrive at Xiping Port.

397
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,920
I only know it’s faster than people.

398
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,920
No matter how fast they ride the horse,

399
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,680
they can’t be faster than a raven.

400
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,199
He owes me his life.

401
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,119
Do you think he will

402
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,839
take Fang Jianming’s life

403
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,839
to return my favor?

404
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,280
I mean,

405
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,079
is the snow

406
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,280
following us?

407
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,079
We’ve been out for two days,

408
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,119
and it has been snowing
for two days and two nights.

409
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,599
And we can’t start a fire.

410
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
I think

411
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
we might as well start a fire

412
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,119
to attract a few Huku’s soldiers.

413
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
Then we can have a fight

414
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,479
to warm ourselves up.

415
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,760
I’m Song Dian.

416
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,000
I was in a hurry
to catch up with you guys

417
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,079
and didn’t bring many blankets.

418
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,319
Just make do for the night.

419
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,439
Share one blanket with others.

420
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,439
Keep yourselves warm.

421
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Don’t be trembling because of the cold

422
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,479
and can’t even hold the sword

423
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
when the Huku people show up.

424
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,520
Here.

425
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,079
Thanks a lot.

426
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,119
Brother.

427
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,359
Distribute them to everyone.

428
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,640
Here, bro.

429
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,439
Here.

430
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,760
General Tang told me earlier

431
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
that there is a leader

432
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,680
who spent eight years
in the Huangquan Battalion.

433
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,119
It should be you, right?

434
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,760
Yes.

435
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,959
Greetings to Mr. Fang.

436
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,959
I heard

437
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,839
that you were responsible
for inspecting and sending messages.

438
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,280
They call you a walking map.

439
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
I guess you must

440
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,000
know the surroundings really well.

441
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,439
That’s why they sent you here.

442
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes.

443
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,760
Mr. Song.

444
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,479
Are you from Hanzhou?

445
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,040
Yes.

446
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,800
It’s colder in Hanzhou

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,239
most of the time in a year.

448
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,959
The locals got used to it.

449
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,199
Otherwise, how could we stand
to stay in this place?

450
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,839
We are not like
you guys from Zhongzhou.

451
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,400
You stay here
for about two or three years.

452
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,760
When it’s time to relieve a garrison,

453
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,640
you just cry like a baby
and want to go back.

454
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,119
Don’t be so mean.

455
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,959
Even if you’re from Hanzhou,

456
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,520
are you really willing

457
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,800
to stay in the camp?

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,560
Exactly.

459
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,319
No matter what,

460
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,359
it’s much more comfortable
at home than in the camp.

461
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,640
If it weren’t for

462
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,839
my family,

463
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,199
who would stay in a place like this?

464
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
There are also oases in Hanzhou.

465
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,520
It’s not all gobi here.

466
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,959
We’ve been walking for two days.

467
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,040
There is no trace of the Huku people.

468
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,599
Mr. Song, do you think

469
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,479
the Huku people would be

470
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,599
hiding in an oasis nearby?

471
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,439
The Huku people rob people for a living.

472
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,839
Why would they stay in the oasis?

473
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
To rest?

474
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,199
What’s more,

475
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,280
it’s getting cold now.

476
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,719
The life in most oases

477
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
is also getting tougher.

478
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,880
Then how can we find the Huku people?

479
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,439
At least 1,000 people

480
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
evacuated from Well Town.

481
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,079
There is no way
that they leave no trace.

482
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,479
But it has been snowing

483
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,640
during this time.

484
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,199
Even if there is any horse dung,
it would be covered.

485
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:00,599
Mr. Fang.

486
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
You are attentive indeed.

487
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,680
Mr. Song,
I would appreciate your guidance.

488
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,160
I dare not.

489
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,160
However,

490
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,199
those Huku brutes are starved this year.

491
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,800
After knowing we have food
inside the pass,

492
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,800
they are like

493
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,719
wolves smelling the blood.

494
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,160
They were counterattacked
when they invaded Well Town.

495
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,719
Now they fixed their eyes
on Huangquan Pass.

496
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,479
If they go from the west

497
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,920
and make a detour of 150 kilometers
to find food,

498
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,199
I’m afraid they will be starved to death

499
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
before they find any.

500
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,079
They might as well
look for the Jiaman people.

501
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,479
The Jiaman people?

502
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,239
Yes.

503
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
Outside Huangquan Pass,

504
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,719
Jiaman is in the east
and Huku is in the west.

505
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
Huku is divided into
the Left Tribe and the Right Tribe.

506
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,520
Most of the Jiaman people are scattered,

507
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,199
but they also have
their own gathering place.

508
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,000
The Huku people like to raid the place

509
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:39,880
where the Jiaman people gather.

510
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,520
In addition to looting food,

511
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,880
they would also
capture thousands of people

512
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,719
and keep them in the camp.

513
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,760
They would use them as two-legged sheep

514
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,839
during the war.

515
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,520
Two-legged sheep?

516
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,599
It means two-legged animals.

517
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:50,920
They are used as cows or horses
in daily lives

518
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,040
and shields in a battle.

519
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,640
In the books on the art of war,

520
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,920
they only teach how to use fire bulls.

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,319
It never taught anything
about using people

522
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,239
as shields.

523
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,160
These people

524
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,479
can literally do anything

525
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,400
to win a war.

526
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,680
Xiao Wu.

527
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:05,880
Do you remember

528
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,280
there seemed to be Jiaman people

529
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,439
when we fought at Well Town?

530
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,760
Yes.

531
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
Why are they

532
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,119
scattered everywhere?

533
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,880
The Jiaman people have always been

534
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,839
eccentric among the barbarians.

535
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,079
They make a living
by farming, weaving and trading.

536
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,119
They don’t like fighting.

537
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,199
In the past few years,

538
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,520
they were invaded
by other barbarian tribes.

539
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,719
So they lost their lands gradually

540
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,719
and became refugees.

541
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,760
What’s more, Jiaman people are small.

542
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,040
You can tell it immediately

543
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,760
when they are

544
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,119
among the tall and strong Huku people.

545
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,719
That’s why they are caught
by the Huku people

546
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,640
and used as shields.

547
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,560
Mr. Song,
tomorrow we need you to take us

548
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,920
to the gathering place

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,359
of the Jiaman people.

550
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,199
Yes.

551
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,520
Let’s get some sleep.

552
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,839
We need to travel tomorrow.

553
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,280
Let’s get some sleep.

554
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,359
Come on.

555
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,839
Wake up.

556
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,959
Brother.

557
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,359
The snow stopped?

558
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,839
How did we sleep for so long?

559
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,959
Thank god the snow has stopped.

560
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:14,880
Otherwise

561
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,119
it would bury us alive.

562
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,719
Where is Mr. Song?

563
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,079
Wasn’t he sleeping here

564
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,119
last night?

565
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,280
Sir.

566
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
I just took a look around

567
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,400
to tell the direction.

568
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,040
It will take about one day

569
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,040
if we walk north

570
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,040
to Mount Piluo.

571
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,119
The Jiaman people often gather

572
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,239
at the foot of Mount Piluo.

573
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,000
Good.

574
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,400
Then let’s head for Mount Piluo.

575
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:39,319
Yes.

576
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,520
Brother.

577
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,599
There are more footprints.

578
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,719
Are there a lot of Jiaman people?

579
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,800
There are a lot more hoof prints

580
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,160
along the way.

581
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,040
There are more hoof prints indeed.

582
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,560
Oh no.

583
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:06,800
Could it be that the Huku people

584
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
are chasing the Jiaman people?

585
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,640
These footprints are towards the east.

586
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,239
We should head for the east now.

587
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,520
It had been snowing heavily
for a couple of days in a row.

588
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,079
If there were footprints,

589
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,640
they’d be covered up by now.

590
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Suddenly so many footprints sprang up.

591
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,959
I guess there is an ambush.

592
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:23,959
Mr. Fang.

593
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,199
Don’t miss the chance.

594
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,560
We should chase them now.

595
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,319
Mr. Song.

596
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,680
Where did you go last night?

597
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:37,800
Who sent you here?

598
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,000
Who is behind you?

599
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,400
Brother.

600
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,520
What should we do?

601
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,880
He led us here.

602
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,319
I guess the Huku people

603
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,160
must be nearby.

604
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,760
The only place around here

605
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,439
that can hide a lot of people
is Mount Piluo.

606
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,239
Then let’s follow the hoof prints.

607
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,719
He asked us to go east.

608
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,560
That means

609
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,680
we can’t go east.

610
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:08,719
Well,

611
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:09,839
come with me.

612
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:10,920
Let’s outflank them

613
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,800
and check it out.

614
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,079
Yes.

615
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:35,439
My king.

616
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:37,119
We lost him

617
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,199
after we got news

618
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,160
that they were heading here

619
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,160
with Fang Haishi.

620
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,280
We didn’t find

621
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,040
any trace of him.

622
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,079
Did he see through

623
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,359
the trap here?

624
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,680
Never mind.

625
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,319
Let’s stick to the plan.

626
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,199
You are the spearhead in this battle.

627
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,040
If you see Fang Haishi,

628
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,319
kill that brat for me.

629
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,959
If you don’t see him,

630
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,040
just forget about him.

631
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Try to avoid the picket of Dazheng

632
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,280
and head directly for
Huangquan Battalion.

633
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,839
Our goal

634
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,560
is to take down Huangquan Pass.

635
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
If we win this battle,

636
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,439
Hanzhou

637
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,280
will belong to the Left Tribe of Huku.

638
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,839
There are a lot of them, Brother.

639
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,319
What should we do?

640
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
It seems to be the main force of Huku.

641
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,719
They are marching toward
Huangquan Battalion.

642
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,439
They’re going to make a surprise attack.

643
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,680
No.

644
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,479
Go back and inform General Tang.

645
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,400
I’ll go to Qilin Battalion

646
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,760
and see if I can get some support.

647
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,719
Okay.

648
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,760
The Huku Army is coming!

649
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,760
The Huku Army is coming!

650
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,000
Get ready for war!

651
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,319
- Get ready for war!
- It’s Wu Yang and Xiao Wu.

652
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,719
Open the gate.

653
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,959
Yes.

654
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:29,920
As expected,

655
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:30,880
there was news the day before yesterday

656
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,839
that the Left Tribe of Huku

657
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,400
was still in Well Town.

658
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,560
Today they have been secretly

659
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,959
marching towards Huangquan Pass.

660
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,319
They want to take the upper hand
by a surprise attack.

661
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:39,719
Mr. Fu.

662
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,599
Yes.

663
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,079
Send a message
to Qilin Battalion now

664
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:42,880
and ask them for support.

665
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,719
Yes.

666
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,599
General Tang.

667
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,599
Mr. Fang has headed for

668
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,719
Qilin Battalion.

669
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
What?

670
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,760
Mr. Fang is not familiar
with the terrain.

671
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,800
To avoid accidents,

672
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,560
send the message again.

673
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,680
Yes.

674
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,599
The scout team set out now

675
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,839
to inspect along the way

676
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,680
from Huangquan Pass to Mount Piluo.

677
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,880
Send a message back every half an hour

678
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:58,800
without any delays.

679
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,800
Yes.

680
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,319
Mr. Zhang.

681
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,040
Dispatch the troops immediately

682
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,199
and ask them to stand by.

683
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,439
- Yes.
- Yes.

684
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,480
(Jubei Town)

685
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,880
Chen Heran, Prefect of Xiping Port,

686
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,560
greets Lord Qinghai.

687
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,560
How is it going now?

688
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,359
The enemy warships
haven’t made any move.

689
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,920
But we are within striking distance.

690
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,119
What’s the situation
of the enemy and us?

691
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,199
The enemy warships are no more than

692
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,760
a hundred miles away from Xiping Port.

693
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,599
If they sail ahead of the wind,

694
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:29,760
it will take them less than one hour

695
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,359
to attack Xiping Port.

696
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,439
Now we know

697
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,760
they have thirty big warships.

698
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
We don’t know if they have reserves.

699
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,400
The military of Xiping Port

700
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,040
only has eight big warships

701
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,239
and fifteen boats.

702
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,199
We have more than 10,000 troops.

703
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,359
With Liushang Troops,

704
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,560
we only have 20,000 men.

705
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,119
It can be a long battle.

706
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,560
Lord Qinghai,
you galloped for hundreds of miles.

707
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
You must be exhausted now.

708
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,280
Why don’t you have a rest first?

709
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,079
Send all the files
about military deployments

710
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,520
and personnel distribution

711
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,439
to my room.

712
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,199
And also,

713
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,880
include the specialties

714
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,800
of the generals and vice-generals.

715
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes.

716
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,880
Lord Qinghai.

717
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,640
This is the deputy general, Xiu Feng.

718
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,599
He is prudent

719
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,160
and familiar with Xiping Port.

720
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,000
He will follow you on the day of battle

721
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,079
to serve you.

722
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,239
I’ll show you the way.

723
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,239
Lord Qinghai, please follow me.

724
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,040
Don’t be scared.

725
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,319
General Tang.

726
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,800
The Huku army is approaching.

727
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,920
When will you give the order
to release arrows?

728
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,599
There are many Jiaman people
in the crowd.

729
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,640
I’m afraid we might hurt them

730
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,920
if we release arrows rashly.

731
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,000
The situation is very dangerous.

732
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,199
If we lose Huangquan pass,

733
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,640
it can jeopardize Dazheng.

734
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,040
Raise your bows.

735
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,439
Try not to hurt the Jiaman people.

736
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,319
Yes.

737
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Raise your bows!

738
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,880
Raise your bows!

739
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,000
Loose!

740
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,239
General, we can’t defend the gate!

741
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,719
We have to.

742
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,400
Is there any news
from Qilin Battalion?

743
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,560
The reconnaissance line was cut.

744
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,680
The message can’t get through.

745
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,000
It’s Qilin Battalion.

746
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,800
Hya!

747
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,480
Hya!

748
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,959
Soldiers!

749
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:54,599
General.

750
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,319
My sword.

751
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:56,839
Pass the order.

752
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,839
Gather all the people who can fight.

753
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,280
Let’s fight this battle.

754
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,640
We will live and die

755
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,000
with Huangquan Pass.

756
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:03,760
Yes!

757
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,520
Protect the Jiaman people.

758
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,639
Yes!

759
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:26,879
Fall back!

760
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,360
Mr. Fang, you have good eyesight.

761
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,040
You shot the King.

762
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,280
That’s why the Huku people

763
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,479
raised the black flag.

764
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,439
I heard that the Huku people

765
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,679
are never buried when they die.

766
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,000
Only the kings of the tribes

767
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,040
will be sent back

768
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,520
after being killed in a battle

769
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,159
and buried wrapped in gold.

770
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
Lord of Left Pudun

771
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:01,239
was combative.

772
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:02,959
Those 3,000 men who surprise attacked
Huangquan Battalion

773
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,000
are also his subordinates.

774
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:04,959
Now he’s dead.

775
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
That’s why they withdrew.

776
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,360
Is that Zhuoying?

777
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,600
Except for the hair color,

778
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,639
the face and the figure...

779
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,959
Zhuoying and I grew up together.

780
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,320
I won’t make a mistake.

781
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,520
General Tang.

782
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:24,560
Please rise.

783
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,000
We couldn’t have won the battle
without you.

784
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
You saw through the scheme of Huku

785
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:30,719
and got people
to send the message to us.

786
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,520
Then you got support
from Qilin Battalion

787
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,639
and shot Lord of Left Pudun.

788
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,000
You were decisive.

789
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,479
You are a young hero indeed.

790
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,000
I’m flattered, General Tang.

791
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,199
If it weren’t for Huangquan Battalion

792
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,760
and Qilin Battalion
to fight against the enemy together,

793
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,360
it wouldn’t be that easy

794
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
to defeat the Huku Army.

795
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
You are too modest.

796
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,479
General Tang.

797
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,560
I think

798
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,159
what Song Dian did

799
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,919
is not for personal revenge.

800
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,280
There might be more spies

801
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,919
hiding in Huangquan Battalion.

802
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,639
Unfortunately, Song Dian died.

803
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,479
There is no way to find out

804
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,840
who is behind him.

805
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,679
We still need to be careful.

806
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:11,919
Look into it secretly

807
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
and keep the news under wraps.

808
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,280
Yes.

809
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,120
The King of the Left Tribe
of Huku is dead.

810
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,439
The new Lord of Left Pudun

811
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,840
is the old king’s half-brother.

812
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,879
The spy said they were at odds.

813
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,280
That’s why he ordered to retreat.

814
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,239
But I don’t know

815
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:26,639
when they will attack again.

816
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,479
We should be on our guard.

817
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,439
General Tang.

818
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,800
There is one more thing.

819
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,159
What is it?

820
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,360
The refugees from Jiaman...

821
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,760
I know

822
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,399
you are a compassionate person.

823
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,760
But the winter this year
is tougher in Hanzhou.

824
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,399
The people here suffer from
hunger, cold and heavy snow.

825
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,639
The places inside and outside
Huangquan Pass

826
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,360
are poorer than usual.

827
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,120
Huangquan Pass
is the most important pass

828
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,560
in the North of Dazheng.

829
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,320
If we let these refugees in,

830
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,520
they will only consume

831
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,000
our food and medicine.

832
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,360
Mr. Fang.

833
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:01,719
Kindness is desirable.

834
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,399
But I’m afraid
it will affect the military.

835
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,360
Can we

836
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,919
take in those refugees

837
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,360
and keep them in the camp as helpers?

838
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,199
These Jiaman people are used to freedom.

839
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,600
They’ve been treated
as two-legged sheep for years

840
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,600
and they never fought back.

841
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,479
It’s not that easy to bind them.

842
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,560
Not to mention
that the snow has blocked the roads.

843
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,959
It’s not easy to transport provisions.

844
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,959
The southwest coastal defense

845
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,959
was harassed by the troops

846
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,959
of the tribes in Leizhou.

847
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,399
This time,

848
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,719
His Majesty sent Lord Qinghai

849
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,600
to lead Liushang Troops
to defend Xiping Port.

850
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,040
The warfare is intense now.

851
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,159
The court must have its hands full.

852
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,560
We can’t bother the court

853
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,679
with these refugees.

854
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,159
You just said

855
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:33,800
Master led Liushang Troops

856
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:35,159
to Xiping Port?

857
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,199
Yes.

858
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,879
The elite

859
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,360
Liushang Troops

860
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,280
that once shocked

861
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,239
everyone across the state.

862
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,360
How long has it been

863
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
since the world
heard this name last time?

864
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,639
The coastline of Dazheng is long.

865
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:52,320
The tribes in Leizhou
are good at fighting on water.

866
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,639
I’m afraid

867
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,600
Master is going to put in some effort.

868
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,399
We must get all the ships

869
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
in formation.

870
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,679
And...

871
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,760
- Report!
- Here...

872
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,040
Lord Qinghai, it’s a confidential letter
from Huangquan Pass.

873
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,679
You can go back and rest first.

874
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

875
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:26,800
We fought at Huangquan Pass.

876
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,399
Huangquan Battalion and Qilin Battalion
encircled the enemy.

877
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,479
Staff Officer Fang shot and killed

878
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:30,560
the Lord of Left Pudun of Huku.

879
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,719
The Left Tribe of Huku
withdrew from the border.

880
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:33,879
There is no movement of the Right Tribe.

881
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,000
Everything is going well.

882
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,639
Send out the message.

883
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,000
Keep an eye on the Left Tribe

884
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,239
and Right Tribe of Huku,

885
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,719
especially the Right Tribe.

886
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,439
Defend Huangquan Pass with lives

887
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,439
and keep Haishi safe.

888
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:46,479
Yes.

889
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,600
This thumb ring is too valuable.

890
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,719
I don’t want to break it

891
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,199
in the battlefield.

892
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,639
I might as well give it back to you.

893
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,679
If you don’t want to play chess with me,

894
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:17,800
let’s make a bet.

895
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,439
Master, take a guess.

896
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,840
Which hand of mine
is holding the black piece?

897
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,120
If you guess wrong,

898
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,479
I win.

899
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,639
If I win,

900
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,360
you have to promise me one thing.

901
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,280
No matter what mistakes I make

902
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,560
in the future,

903
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:31,000
you can scold me or punish me,

904
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,760
but you can’t ignore me.

905
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,560
All right, Master?

906
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,959
Right hand.

907
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,679
I win.

908
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:40,679
That’s the deal.

909
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,439
You can’t ignore me next time.

910
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,479
I’ve always kept in mind

911
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,560
what you taught me

912
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,120
over these years.

913
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:46,840
I’m also grateful

914
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,199
for your teachings.

915
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,600
I’ll try harder in the future.

916
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:50,800
I broke

917
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:51,840
your jade pendant last time.

918
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,719
So...

919
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
So I made this for you.

920
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
(Fang)

921
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,399
There is a test of horse riding
and shooting a few days later.

922
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,439
You’ve been good at them.

923
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,000
Make me proud.

924
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Yes, Master!

925
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:15,639
Thank you, Master!

926
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,520
Didn’t Master

927
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,919
marry Miss Ju?

928
00:44:28,439 --> 00:44:29,959
Or did he just

929
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,280
put national affairs first as always?

930
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,000
He just got married in a hurry

931
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,760
and then headed for Xiping Port?

932
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,800
How is the battle at Xiping Port?

933
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,199
Is it as intense as in Huangquan Pass?

934
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,879
Mr. Fang.

935
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:46,760
Mr. Zhang.

936
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:47,959
The view of Huangquan Pass

937
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,919
is not as good as Tianqi.

938
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,000
There is withered grass and snow

939
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,520
for most time of the year.

940
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,520
You must be disappointed.

941
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,439
Not at all.

942
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,399
Speaking of local customs,

943
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:58,399
Huangquan Pass is folksier.

944
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,520
What about the refugees of Jiaman?

945
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,719
Mr. Fang, don’t worry

946
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:04,560
about those Jiaman people

947
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:05,600
They

948
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,239
are used to

949
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,840
an unsettled lifestyle.

950
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,800
I guess they won’t

951
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:10,840
get inside the pass.

952
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,840
So they left for Red Plain

953
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,159
at nightfall yesterday.

954
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:15,000
After Red Plain,

955
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,280
that’s their gathering place.

956
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:17,560
Lanzi is there.

957
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,600
Lanzi?

958
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,879
Oh, no.

959
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:24,479
A tip just came in today

960
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,120
that the Right Tribe of Huku

961
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,719
once showed up in Red Plain.

962
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,600
Mr. Fang!

963
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:39,000
General Tang.

964
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,280
Mr. Fang, you are alert indeed.

965
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:41,919
We just got the news

966
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,040
about the Right Tribe of Huku

967
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:43,879
and there you are.

968
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:44,639
Has the Right Tribe of Huku

969
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,439
ever headed toward Red Plain?

970
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,159
According to the latest news
from our spy,

971
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:49,040
the Right Tribe of Huku

972
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:50,000
occupied the gathering place
of the Jiaman people

973
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,080
on Red Plain,

974
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,919
Lanzi.

975
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:56,000
Looks like they are not going to attack

976
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,719
(The Right Tribe of Huku invaded Lanzi)
Huangquan Pass for the time being.

977
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:58,320
(They won’t attack Huangquan Pass
for the time being)

978
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,080
But we don’t know

979
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,199
if the Right Tribe of Huku
will take actions

980
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,800
after resting for a while

981
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,239
and having enough two-legged sheep.

982
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:05,760
Will the Left Tribe join hands

983
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:07,159
with the Right Tribe?

984
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:08,840
The Huku are belligerent by nature.

985
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Although the Left Tribe
and the Right Tribe are both from Huku

986
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,159
and they’re related by blood,

987
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,560
they’ve been at odds

988
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,479
and acting for their own goals.

989
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,080
Joint operations are highly unlikely.

990
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,719
It’s just that the Right Tribe of Huku

991
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:21,520
(Lanzi)
has Lanzi as their supplies now.

992
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:23,120
(Huangquan Pass)
That’s a big concern

993
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,120
for Huangquan Pass.

994
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,760
These refugees of Jiaman

995
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,879
don’t know Lanzi

996
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,879
has been occupied.

997
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,679
They’re heading towards there.

998
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,239
There is nothing we can do.

999
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,320
General Tang.

1000
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:36,959
Please allow me

1001
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,320
to save them.

1002
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,000
No.

1003
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,840
If the Jiaman people

1004
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,719
get caught by the Huku people,

1005
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,439
it will still be detrimental

1006
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,399
to Huangquan Pass in the end.

1007
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,239
Even if we don’t take them in,

1008
00:46:47,439 --> 00:46:48,199
we can’t let them

1009
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,879
get caught by the Huku people.

1010
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,159
Please allow me to take a team

1011
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,439
to inform the Jiaman people

1012
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,760
that Lanzi has been occupied

1013
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:56,120
before they

1014
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:56,919
arrive at Red Plain

1015
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,439
and ask them

1016
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,439
to change their route.

1017
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,239
General Tang.

1018
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,439
All right.

1019
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:06,479
Be quick about it.

1020
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,479
Thanks, General Tang.
