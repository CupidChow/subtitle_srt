25
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,830
Brother,

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,160
your shoulder is bleeding!

27
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,960
Brother,

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,390
you need to stop!

29
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,390
Don’t you know the rules?

30
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,270
Brother!

31
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,030
Brother!

32
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,470
- Let’s go!
- Brother!

33
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,750
What happened to him?

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,630
I don’t know.

35
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,440
Did his old wound

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,520
split open again?

37
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,600
Lord.

38
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,240
Aren’t you supposed to

39
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,550
oversee those on duty in the Palace?

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
Young Master Haishi has been at drill

41
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,110
day and night since he enlisted

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,080
without taking a day off

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,670
despite the relapse of his old wound.

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,390
Are you done?

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,000
He’s exhausting himself.

46
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,190
Maybe you can have someone

47
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,160
talk to him

48
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,390
and ask him to rest.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
He knows what he’s signed up for

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,360
in the army.

51
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,000
Understood.

52
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,830
I’ll take my leave.

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,670
- Mr. Fang.
- Mr. Fang.

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,550
Mr. Zhang.

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,350
Mr. Fu.

56
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,350
Come with me.

57
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,880
The army

58
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,200
has the chain of command.

59
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,510
According to the chain of command,

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,880
what am I to you?

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,880
My commanding officer.

62
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,640
Staff Officer Fang Haishi
of Huangquan Battalion!

63
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,390
Yes, sir!

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Follow me.

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,640
Mr. Fang is really something.

66
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,790
He’s Haishi’s elder brother

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,480
and Bowmen Commandant.

68
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
Of course, he’s something.

69
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,440
What are you doing, Fang Zhuoying?

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
Fang Haishi!

71
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,950
You’re training like mad

72
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,200
without eating or getting any rest.

73
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,920
You could work yourself to death,

74
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,110
you know?

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,040
Come here.

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,510
Let me check your wound.

77
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,830
Leave me alone. I’m fine.

78
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,760
You’ve got one wound after another.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
That will kill you!

80
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,880
Stop making a fuss.

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
What I have

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
isn’t half as many as yours.

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,880
I’ve got a long life ahead of me.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,830
Besides,

85
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
how could I rise through the ranks

86
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
without working hard?

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,070
Are you that desperate to make a name?

88
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,040
You bet!

89
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,390
Names and titles

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,440
are nothing

91
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
but gold chains.

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Can’t you join me

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,230
to do our duty under Master

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,230
and be filial to him?

95
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,270
Wouldn’t that be great?

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,830
“Do our duty and be filial”?

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
That’s right.

98
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,880
Master didn’t bring us to this world

99
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,110
but he raised us.

100
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,000
We ought to treat him

101
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,790
as our father.

102
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,200
“Treat him as our father”?

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
Look,

104
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
he’s only a few years older

105
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,790
than both of us.

106
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,440
Haishi...

107
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
He wasn’t too much of an adult

108
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,350
when he took you in,

109
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,270
was he?

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,480
Fang Haishi!

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,550
Lord Qinghai,

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,390
Fang Jianming, Commander Fang,

113
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,350
is not and will never be my father!

114
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,510
What did you say?

115
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,200
I said nothing but the truth!

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,320
Mr. Fang.

117
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,320
Mr. Fang.

118
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,350
Mr. Fang.

119
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,670
Why are you guys

120
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,790
sneaking around here?

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Mr. Fang,

122
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,270
Haishi is like our brother.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,830
We were worried about his condition,

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,600
so

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
we came to check on him.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Yes.

127
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,110
If you really care about him,

128
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,550
try to talk some sense into him

129
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,040
to stop being stubborn.

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,070
Also,

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,550
don’t bother him

132
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,950
unless necessary

133
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,830
before he recovers.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
Understand?

135
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,160
- Yes.
- Yes, Mr. Fang.

136
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,950
Let’s go.

137
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,230
Lord,

138
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,510
are you sure

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,200
that we just

140
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,720
let Young Master Haishi be out there?

141
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,320
Master, I need to leave

142
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,400
before

143
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,550
the palace gate is locked.

144
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,470
Then stay.

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,790
I’ll have them get you new clothes.

146
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,710
Fang Jianming,

147
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,350
don’t go!

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,710
Master...

149
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,590
I...

150
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,760
like you a lot, Master,

151
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
so much so

152
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,280
that the thought of you leaving me

153
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,880
would break my heart.

154
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,840
Do you...?

155
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you know that?

156
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,280
Master...

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,110
Master?

158
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,230
- Brother!
- Brother!

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,320
Are you alright?

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Your brother asked us

161
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,840
not to disturb you.

162
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,080
We made a big breakfast

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,350
- Yes.
- but didn’t dare to wake you up.

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,520
I saw a bowl of congee on my table.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,550
Did you see

166
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,760
who brought it in?

167
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,840
We made it.

168
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,590
Yes.

169
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,150
We came to wait outside

170
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,280
early this morning.

171
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,790
Other than Wu Yang

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,230
going in to bring you the congee,

173
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,960
we didn’t even

174
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,840
let a fly in.

175
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,790
- Yes.
- That’s right.

176
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,840
Got it.

177
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,840
Mr. Fang,

178
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,960
Mr. Zhang asks to see you
in the Main Camp.

179
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,280
I’m on my way.

180
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,520
Noted.

181
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,840
Mr. Zhang.

182
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,590
Mr. Fang,

183
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,080
how’s your old wound?

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,910
Thanks for your concern.

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,230
It was treated last night.

186
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I’m good

187
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,710
after a night’s sleep.

188
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,790
Good to know.

189
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,350
Is there

190
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,150
any emergency?

191
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,670
We’re going north tomorrow

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to Huangquan Pass.

193
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,960
I’m thinking

194
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,000
if you’re still weak,

195
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:11,960
just stay

196
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,960
and rest for a few more days

197
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,470
before catching us with your squad.

198
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,470
Mr. Fang,

199
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,670
how does that sound?

200
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,200
I’m strong enough

201
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,550
to leave with the main force

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,790
for Huangquan Pass.

203
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,670
Very well.

204
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,200
We’re off duty today

205
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,640
so that our men can go home

206
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,520
and say goodbye to their families.

207
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,200
Why don’t you

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,670
go back to Jifeng Pavilion

209
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,670
to bid farewell to Lord Qinghai
and Mr. Fang Zhuoying?

210
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,520
Tianqi City and Huangquan Pass

211
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
are thousands of miles away.

212
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,760
You won’t get to

213
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,590
see each other again anytime soon.

214
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
Master.

215
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,550
How have you been?

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,590
How’s your work?

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Have Zhuoying and Shaozi

218
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,550
been taking good care of you?

219
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,280
All is well.

220
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,640
I’m back

221
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,840
to bid you farewell.

222
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,470
Finish this game with me

223
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,840
since you’re here.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,670
Come here.

225
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,880
Where do you think you’re going?

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,280
I got you.

227
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,640
Your Majesty,

228
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,760
Miss Zheliu

229
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,840
is really good.

230
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,880
Look at this cute little thing.

231
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,790
It’s alive

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,590
and kicking again.

233
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,230
Does that rabbit have magic power

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,840
that all of you

235
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,230
are so enchanted

236
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,910
that you’ve forgotten what’s important?

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Your Majesty,

238
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,960
most people

239
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
are mediocre like me

240
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,790
who muddle along from day to day

241
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,670
while you, Your Majesty,

242
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
are born a leader

243
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,080
to reshape this world.

244
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,910
You’re incomparable!

245
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
Come here.

246
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
Eat up.

247
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,840
Stop running around.

248
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,790
- Your Majesty.
- Go on.

249
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,280
Physician Li of the Imperial Hospital
requests an audience.

250
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,910
What’s he here for?

251
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,590
I can send him away.

252
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Let him in.

253
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
Come here.

254
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,670
Greetings, Your Majesty.

255
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,350
What is it about?

256
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,910
Your Majesty,

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,790
it’s Consort Shurong.

258
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,640
She’s unwell.

259
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,960
How so?

260
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
It’s... it’s her hand.

261
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,400
It’s been treated

262
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,110
but it won’t be as good as new.

263
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,840
I’m afraid...

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,840
Didn’t the treatment work?

265
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,400
What else could you do

266
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,910
if you failed to cure a little cut?

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
We’ve done everything we can

268
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,470
but Consort Shurong

269
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,790
is still carving every day.

270
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,200
Without enough rest, her hand will...

271
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,670
Your Majesty,

272
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,840
we...

273
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,150
we’d better do something about it.

274
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,200
Your Highness,

275
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,080
you’re carving nonstop.

276
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
That’s bad for your hand.

277
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,520
Please! I’m begging you

278
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,520
to take a break.

279
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,550
We’re really worried about you.

280
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,320
Please stop for our sake.

281
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,200
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

282
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,230
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

283
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,790
Rise.

284
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,350
How many Dragon Tail Pendants
have you made?

285
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,550
More than half.

286
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
It’ll only take 10 more days

287
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,110
to finish all of them.

288
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,080
I only said that as a joke.

289
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,150
I didn’t expect

290
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,960
you’d take it seriously.

291
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,230
I’m a woman of my word.

292
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,000
I’d never joke

293
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,440
about promises.

294
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,470
Too bad,

295
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,960
those stained with blood look dirty.

296
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,550
When we played years back,

297
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,910
you’d cry for fear of losing.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,110
But now, you’ve progressed

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,520
so quickly

300
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
that you can even play absent-mindedly.

301
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,910
This move was too hasty.

302
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,910
Think carefully before making a move.

303
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,470
Don’t be reckless.

304
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,350
Victory is achieved

305
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,350
one step at a time.

306
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,520
“Make losses for an advantage”.

307
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,830
You taught me that.

308
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,470
At this stage,

309
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,000
you can’t devour me

310
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,400
or let me go.

311
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,400
So, what’s next?

312
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,430
What’s on your mind?

313
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
I’m wondering

314
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,160
the same thing about you.

315
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,430
You were in my camp yesterday.

316
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,590
Why were you there?

317
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,160
Why are you playing with me now?

318
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,680
Are you going to tell me

319
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
that if I’m having a rough time

320
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,400
in Huangquan Battalion,

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,470
I can hang back,

322
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,350
waiting for you to give me another post?

323
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,310
Lord,

324
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,470
Imperial Manufactories have brought over

325
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,800
Young Master Haishi’s formal robe.

326
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,000
They’re waiting for feedback.

327
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
Master.

328
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,400
I should go.

329
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,640
I’m not sure when I’ll come back,

330
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,280
so it’s better

331
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,160
that I make myself clear before leaving.

332
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,800
You are special

333
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,680
to me.

334
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,680
So please don’t

335
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
take any step further,

336
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,710
either

337
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,710
for old times’ sake

338
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,350
or out of

339
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,830
care and concern.

340
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,560
Don’t do it.

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,590
One misstep

342
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,230
and I might

343
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,400
say or do things

344
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,590
I shouldn’t.

345
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,760
When that happens,

346
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,640
I’ll have to spend the rest of my life

347
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
far away from the capital

348
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,590
and we’ll never see each other again.

349
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,350
Right now, it’s still anyone’s game
to win.

350
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,430
If I fought tooth and nail

351
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,920
against you,

352
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,040
I’d have a fair chance to win.

353
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,680
I’m going to wash my hands

354
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,430
and start over.

355
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,640
Stop!

356
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
What are you up to?

357
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
To make yourself one-handed

358
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,680
so that they’ll call me

359
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,760
mean and heartless?

360
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,000
Enough of this grandstanding!

361
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,280
Don’t make a scene!

362
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,710
Your Majesty!

363
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,280
Your Majesty!

364
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,230
I’m sorry, Your Majesty!

365
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,470
I swear Consort Shurong didn’t mean

366
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,230
to injure you!

367
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,400
Spare us, Your Majesty!

368
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,430
Guards!

369
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,430
Consort Shurong is disobedient

370
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,680
due to the incitement of her maids.

371
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,470
Take those two lowlifes away

372
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,830
and flog them to death.

373
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
- Spare us, Your Majesty!
- Have mercy on us, Your Majesty!

374
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,680
We don’t regret dying for you,

375
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,040
but I’m sorry

376
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,190
to leave you alone, Your Highness!

377
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,310
Take care!

378
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,800
Do take care of yourself, Your Highness!

379
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,710
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

380
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,520
Hold on.

381
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,000
I didn’t mean to offend you.

382
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,160
There’s something

383
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,560
I’d like to show you.

384
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,560
Please allow me to fetch it.

385
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,760
I swear to Dragon Tail

386
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,230
if I mean any harm,

387
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
I shall die miserably

388
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,350
and be abandoned by god.

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,680
When I first arrived in Dazheng

390
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
and met you,

391
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,430
I held a grudge

392
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,560
because I felt abandoned and lonely

393
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,040
and that my life was never easy.

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,110
But now...

395
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,680
My grudge is gone

396
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,310
because I realize

397
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,710
your life isn’t any better either.

398
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,310
You’re deprived of happiness

399
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,350
and so am I.

400
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,230
Unlike Zizan,

401
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
I’m not your love

402
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,280
and I didn’t get to know you.

403
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,640
But I made

404
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
another Dragon Tail Pendant

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,280
to keep

406
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,110
yours company

407
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,400
if it’s

408
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,590
any comfort to you.

409
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,160
This one is clean.

410
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,070
There’s no blood on it.

411
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,640
Why do you keep

412
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,760
ripping off my scab?

413
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,000
Aren’t you afraid I’ll kill you?

414
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,230
Dragon Tail

415
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,950
blesses all of us.

416
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,950
If you decide

417
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,280
to take my life,

418
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,160
I’ll accept that

419
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,680
as my fate.

420
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,230
But please let go

421
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,190
of the innocent.

422
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,470
I don’t need this pendant.

423
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,590
You can stop

424
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,520
finishing those 30,000
Dragon Tail Pendants.

425
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,190
Your Majesty,

426
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,280
what about those two maids?

427
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,590
Take them and Consort Shurong

428
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,040
back to Yu’an Palace.

429
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,710
Yes.

430
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,950
There you are.

431
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,110
Let’s go.

432
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,230
Mr. Fang Zhuoying. Mr. Fang Haishi.

433
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,800
- Uncle Shi.
- Eunuch Shi.

434
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,560
Young Master Haishi,

435
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,280
look.

436
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,000
It’s a well-made robe.

437
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,560
Of course.

438
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,880
You’re

439
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Lord Qinghai’s favorite disciple.

440
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,280
Only the finest garments

441
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,920
suit you.

442
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,830
Young Master Haishi,

443
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,230
please try it on

444
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,470
and see if it fits.

445
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,710
Thanks for bringing it over.

446
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,880
I’m sure it’s the right size

447
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,160
without putting it on. I trust you.

448
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,110
And I’m saving it

449
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,680
for important events.

450
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,190
I’m getting jealous, Eunuch Shi.

451
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,920
Don’t be, Young Master Zhuoying.

452
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,920
We have yours, too.

453
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,880
Behold!

454
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,520
This one

455
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,590
is also exquisitely made.

456
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,800
As you can see,

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,040
gold and black

458
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,590
can bring out your charisma perfectly.

459
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,950
Check out this eagle.

460
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Those eyes are so vivid

461
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,560
as if

462
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,310
they’re staring at us.

463
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,760
Am I right, Young Master Zhuoying?

464
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,160
Good.

465
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,830
It’s better than good!

466
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,280
You know what?

467
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,430
Lord Chang

468
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,110
dropped by Imperial Manufactories earlier

469
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,040
and caught a glimpse of Zheliu’s design.

470
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,040
Then he claimed

471
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,520
the eagle she made

472
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
was a copy of his pet,

473
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,110
so he should get the robe.

474
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,560
But eagles

475
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,520
have never been allowed into the Palace

476
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,430
since the founding of our nation.

477
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,520
Even if they were,

478
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,350
Zheliu and Lord Chang’s pet

479
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,680
would never cross paths.

480
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,160
I had to convince Lord Chang

481
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,760
that this robe was embroidered

482
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,920
with thin copper thread

483
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,760
from Zhunian in the southwest Leizhou.

484
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
As glittering as it seemed,

485
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,640
it’d be heavy

486
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,110
and rough to wear.

487
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,830
Generals would be fine with it,

488
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,710
but a gentleman like Lord Chang

489
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,830
should deserve something much better.

490
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,590
Once the new silk arrived,

491
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,560
Zheliu could make him

492
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,280
an eagle robe

493
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,520
softer and more comfortable to wear.

494
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,430
It took me a long while

495
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,830
to make him happy again.

496
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,800
He’s so hard to please!

497
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,280
I wouldn’t dare to fool you.

498
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,310
The eagle on this robe

499
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,280
was handmade

500
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,000
by Zheliu.

501
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,160
That girl gave it her all

502
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,110
and worked around the clock

503
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,350
to complete your robes.

504
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,310
She shouldn’t!

505
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,880
That’d make her ill!

506
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,950
I’ll definitely wait

507
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,520
until the big day

508
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,950
to put it on.

509
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,640
Young Master Haishi, you’re setting off

510
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,000
with the army
for Huangquan Pass tomorrow.

511
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,470
I can’t be there to see you off.

512
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,520
I wish you

513
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,830
a safe trip.

514
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,830
Please give my regards

515
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,920
to Lord Qinghai, too.

516
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,880
Take care.

517
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,400
Good night.

518
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,680
- Good night, Uncle Shi.
- Good night, Eunuch Shi.

519
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,680
Zhuoying,

520
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,680
are you familiar with this line,

521
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,040
“Gather rosebuds while you may.

522
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Wait not till the bloom’s away”?

523
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,110
What do you know?

524
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,950
Fang Zhuoying, wait!

525
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,760
Are you shy?

526
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Young Masters,

527
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,160
Lord said it’s late.

528
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,110
The troops are leaving early tomorrow,

529
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,310
so Young Master Haishi

530
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,230
can stay the night at Zhaoming Palace.

531
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,590
Stay the night here?

532
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,470
But I don’t have a room.

533
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,470
Don’t worry.

534
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,710
He can take mine.

535
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,070
I’ll go crash with Shaozi.

536
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,310
Lord anticipated that.

537
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,310
He said he’d be too busy

538
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,160
to be back tonight

539
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,000
and asked Young Master Haishi

540
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,880
to use his room.

541
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,920
Sure.

542
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,040
Why not?

543
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,710
You can stay

544
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,880
and drink with me.

545
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,510
(Moral and Virtuous)

546
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Master,

547
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,880
I should go.

548
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,040
I’m not sure when I’ll come back,

549
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,640
so

550
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,920
it’s better

551
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,640
that I make myself clear before leaving.

552
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,110
You are special

553
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,920
to me.

554
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,560
So please don’t

555
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,520
take any step further,

556
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,800
either

557
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
for old times’ sake

558
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,400
or out of

559
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,800
care and concern.

560
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,310
Don’t do it.

561
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,880
One misstep

562
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,110
and I might

563
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,400
say or do things

564
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,070
I shouldn’t.

565
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,230
When that happens,

566
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,430
I’ll have to spend the rest of my life

567
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,400
far away from the capital

568
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,310
and we’ll never see each other again.

569
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,760
Haishi,

570
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,350
taking the step is easy

571
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,640
but I can’t

572
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,310
because I don’t have a choice.

573
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,310
Back then, Prince Yi rebelled

574
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,350
in the name of eliminating traitors

575
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,800
during which royalty was massacred,

576
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,070
civilians were slaughtered,

577
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,560
and loyal officials were executed.

578
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,950
Crown Prince Boyao said
he’d live and die with the nation

579
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,470
and hung himself,

580
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,190
leaving Xu and me alone.

581
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,640
We had to fight with our life

582
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,400
to not lose the state to enemies.

583
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,070
I didn’t know how far I could go

584
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,830
when Xu and Zizan

585
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,760
were my only company.

586
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,110
But I acted on impulse

587
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,590
and moved up the encirclement
after what happened to my family

588
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,230
which killed Zizan

589
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,360
and almost Xu, too.

590
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,040
To boost morale,

591
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,230
to stabilize the situation,

592
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,520
to make sure sacrifices we made

593
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,390
wouldn’t end up

594
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,600
in vain,

595
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,670
and most importantly,

596
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,120
to not lose my one last friend,

597
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,190
I chose to become his Baixi

598
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,520
to have our life bonded together

599
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,630
and myself

600
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,910
take all his future pain and misfortune.

601
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,760
Haishi,

602
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,430
without you,

603
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,630
I’d probably

604
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,760
endure all that alone

605
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,190
to the end.

606
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,040
But you showed up.

607
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,430
You made me truly understand

608
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,910
what they call an unregretful

609
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,040
but painful life.

610
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Haishi,

611
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,870
I owe you.

612
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,760
Haishi,

613
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,470
it’s time to get ready.

614
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,430
I know.

615
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,080
You should line up at 5:45 AM

616
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,080
outside Zhuque Gate.

617
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,470
You’re assigned by His Majesty

618
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,320
and everyone respects you for that,

619
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,670
but you must always be humble.

646
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,000
Master,

647
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,150
this thumb ring is too valuable

648
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,710
to be destroyed on the battlefield.

649
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,190
You should have it back.

650
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,430
Master,

651
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
do you remember that poem,

652
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,190
“You Walk Far and Further”?

653
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,950
Take care, Master.

654
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,760
Haishi...

655
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,800
“All that aside,

656
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,190
take good care of yourself”.

657
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
So long, Master.

658
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,600
Zizan,

659
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,910
ever since you left,

660
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,630
the day has dragged on

661
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,840
as if it would never end

662
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,040
while the night has shortened
day after day.

663
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,910
Sometimes,

664
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,710
it ended so quickly

665
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,760
before I could close my eyes.

666
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,470
I saw Tilan
at the South Palace yesterday.

667
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,560
Even she could tell how lonely I was.

668
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,840
She said life is hard.

669
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,600
It is, really.

670
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,080
You two have nothing in common

671
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,870
except for the look.

672
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,040
If it were you,

673
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,080
you’d ask me to do the right thing.

674
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,630
To be a good emperor,

675
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,950
a good husband,

676
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,760
and a good father

677
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,120
to the day

678
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,320
I die.

679
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,000
But without you,

680
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,870
all that seems impossible

681
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,800
no matter how hard

682
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,230
I’ve tried.

683
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,760
Zizan,

684
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,800
I know you’d want me

685
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,950
to go on with this journey,

686
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,630
but I don’t think

687
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,840
I can go through it alone.

688
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,040
His Majesty’s edict is as follows:

689
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,670
I’m addressing this speech

690
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,080
(Zheng)
to all of you.

691
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,320
We’re holding this ceremony

692
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,230
to pray to ancestors for your victory.

693
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,000
Troops are massed

694
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,870
to fight against evil,

695
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,040
wipe out rebels,

696
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,950
and uphold justice.

697
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,230
Lord Qinghai is to perform the ritual

698
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,390
on my behalf.

699
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,840
Respect this.

700
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,230
Perform the ritual!

701
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,950
Kneel!

702
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,360
Bow!

703
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,360
Rise!

704
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,430
Up!

705
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,670
Honor the flag!

706
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,030
(Zheng)

707
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,470
No blasphemy.

708
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,710
No hunting.

709
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,390
No destruction of buildings.

710
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,910
No burning of houses.

711
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,840
No stealing of firewood,
grains and utensils.

712
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,710
Leave the old and young

713
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,390
unharmed.

714
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,840
No fighting

715
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,190
unless attacked.

716
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,040
You will be

717
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,360
rewarded and punished

718
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,000
accordingly.

719
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,000
Yes!

720
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,280
Long live, Your Majesty!

721
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,910
Long live, Your Majesty!

722
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,080
Completed!

723
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,520
Lord Qinghai,

724
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,080
if you’ll excuse me.

725
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,150
(Capital Capital Basin Central Highland)

726
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,400
(Yinheyou Zhongzhou)

727
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,590
(Mingquan Tiantuo Strait)

728
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,150
(Shuanghuan City Hanzhou)

729
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,560
Your Majesty,

730
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,120
news came back that Boot Camp

731
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,800
would soon join Huangquan Battalion.

732
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,190
I see.

733
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,560
It’s recorded

734
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,470
that when the last emperor of Duan,
Mu Yunsheng,

735
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:14,870
had to

736
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,600
give up Tianqi

737
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,000
on a windy autumn day,

738
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,080
fire broke out somewhere after noon,

739
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,520
lighting up 100 miles

740
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,150
by the next dawn.

741
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,560
I was thinking

742
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,120
it was on a day like this

743
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,280
that the whole city
got burned down overnight.

744
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,390
(Virtuous, Diligent, Pleasant and Quiet)
I’m assuming

745
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,670
that you didn’t entrust me

746
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,190
with the ritual

747
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,040
only to review history here.

748
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,840
Zizan once said

749
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,470
she loved the golden autumn days

750
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,520
in Tianqi most.

751
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,430
According to her,

752
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,470
gold symbolized thriving

753
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,910
and prosperity.

754
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,800
The golden sunset is beautiful.

755
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,230
“Girls picking water chestnuts
are singing.

756
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,430
The smoke is rising
from chimneys at sunset”.

757
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,280
The sun goes up and down

758
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,360
every day.

759
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,120
Only ordinary people

760
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,600
are entitled to have hope.

761
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
What’s your point?

762
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,600
Are you lecturing me again?

763
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,000
I wouldn’t dare, Your Majesty.

764
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,840
We’re born into this family

765
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,710
without much control over our fate,

766
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,000
so we shouldn’t expect more.

767
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,320
Better let go of

768
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,150
what doesn’t belong to us.

769
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,870
Don’t you agree?

770
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:54,630
Jianming,

771
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,000
the old you would never say that.

772
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,120
Since when

773
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,760
did you become so pessimistic?

774
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,120
If you could let go of everything,

775
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,470
would there be

776
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,390
anything left in your heart?

777
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,910
Yes.

778
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,080
I’d still have my calling.

779
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,760
Your Majesty,

780
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,230
look over there.

781
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:26,910
The afterglow and the sky

782
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,190
seem to have blended into one another

783
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,470
at a far distance.

784
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,520
But can they actually be together?

785
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,950
However close they seem,

786
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,430
the distance in between is infinite.

787
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,870
Ever since Dazheng was established,

788
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,430
every emperor

789
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,670
has made the leader of the Fang Family

790
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,760
of Liushang his Baixi.

791
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,320
As far as I’m concerned,

792
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,080
expectations

793
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,560
and intimacy

794
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,560
will do no good to everyone.

795
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,600
If your elder brothers

796
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,390
and mine were still alive,

797
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,430
I wouldn’t be here with the crown...

798
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,870
You’re the chosen one, Your Majesty.

799
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:03,870
But no one has bothered to ask me

800
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,950
if I want to be chosen.

801
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,390
The truth is, I don’t.

802
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,040
I’ve never intended

803
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,320
to have you as my Baixi.

804
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,710
I chose to be it.

805
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,760
That was my own decision.
