I’m in such good health.

26
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,499
He still made me
change my dressing every day.

27
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,839
Change and change.

28
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,425
I’m like a little girl now.

29
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,960
Haishi?

30
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:48,645
Haishi.

31
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:50,255
You’re finally back.

32
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:50,960
Hey.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,839
You know what,

34
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,119
when you were not around these days,

35
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:53,919
Master only said five sentences

36
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,520
to me a day at most.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,440
If you don’t come back,

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,675
I will lose my ability to talk.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,379
What’s wrong with you?

40
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:06,720
Zhuoying.

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,660
What is right,

42
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,696
and what is wrong?

43
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:15,875
Why are you asking that suddenly?

44
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,716
Master sent me out for a task.

45
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,225
Uncle Zhao died.

46
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,250
Haishi.

47
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,055
In the world,

48
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,865
there are causalities
in a lot of things.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,740
Master won’t kill anyone for no reason.

50
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,614
Maybe Uncle Zhao did something

51
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:48,600
he shouldn’t do

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,801
and it got him killed.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,190
I wasn’t used to this at first.

54
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:56,800
Later,

55
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:58,914
I just got used to it.

56
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,679
Causality?

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,160
What exactly is causality?

58
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,360
You know what,

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,199
when the knife went into him,

60
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,679
I thought of my father.

61
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:16,545
My father took me to the sea

62
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,235
to look for luminous pearls.
This is the cause.

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I struggled

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,875
to survive. This is the effect.

65
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,416
I struggled. This is the cause.

66
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,854
The effect is I bit my father’s hand.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,940
My father’s hand was bleeding.
This is the cause.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,519
So he was eaten by the sharks.

69
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,600
This is the effect.

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,920
These things seem to be linked together.

71
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,774
But what’s before that?

72
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,806
Why would my father
look for luminous pearls?

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,161
Why am I my father’s daughter?

74
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,040
My parents and I

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,279
were living in a fishing village.

76
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,874
Our lives

77
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,440
were like

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,239
insignificant grass.

79
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,305
Any gust of wind

80
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,664
can determine our lives.

81
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,270
You said it’s the causality.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,119
What about those

83
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,440
who can’t decide their fate?

84
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:04,666
Do they have to accept it?

85
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,184
Emperor Xu’s life matters.

86
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,420
The lives of other people don’t matter?

87
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,029
Just to be loyal,

88
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,320
does it mean all the time

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,659
we spent together

90
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,350
is fake?

91
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:27,135
Haishi.

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,020
Listen.

93
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:30,835
You took orders.

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,950
Even if it’s wrong, it’s not your fault.

95
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:34,985
As for what you don’t understand,

96
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,575
I’ll ask for you.

97
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:38,355
I’ll get you an explanation.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,359
Commander.

99
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:46,945
This is the record of Uncle Zhao’s trips

100
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,249
made by the guy
who was tailing Uncle Zhao.

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,880
His contacts with Nihualuo’s spy

102
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,839
were all written

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,521
on it.

104
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:54,760
And also,

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
I’ve taken care of

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,100
Uncle Zhao’s funeral.

107
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,079
Good.

108
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,321
Well done.

109
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,675
You can leave.

110
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:04,755
Yes.

111
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:07,795
Master!

112
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,200
It’s late.

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,920
What’s wrong?

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,639
There are a million things going on
at Jifeng Pavilion.

115
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,239
Why did you have to

116
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,160
ask Haishi to kill Uncle Zhao?

117
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
He could choose not to kill him.

118
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,399
Master.

119
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,640
You know

120
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,959
Haishi will do

121
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,975
whatever you ask him to do.

122
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,359
I know

123
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,559
you wouldn’t kill Uncle Zhao
for no reason.

124
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,675
But why can’t you

125
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,725
tell Haishi why you did it?

126
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,625
- That’s not necessary.
- Not necessary?

127
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,440
Master.

128
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,991
It was Haishi’s friend who he killed.

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
Once you entered Jifeng Pavilion,

130
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:44,959
you have to throw away

131
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,100
personal relationships.

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,721
Whether it’s your friend,

133
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,234
your teacher,

134
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,109
or your brother and sister,

135
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,924
it’s just a way you call them.

136
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,534
Don’t care about it.

137
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,184
Don’t care about it?

138
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,920
Master.

139
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,000
So you took in

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Haishi and me

141
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,119
just because you wanted someone

142
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,519
you can use?

143
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,040
I think

144
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,951
since I’m a man,

145
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,920
it doesn’t matter

146
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,119
that you raised me up in a rough way.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,399
What about Haishi?

148
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,399
You care about Haishi

149
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,300
and love Haishi.

150
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,274
I don’t get it now.

151
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,240
Do you remember

152
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,480
that he was given a choice

153
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,699
before we saved him?

154
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,616
If you choose

155
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,775
to be a girl by my side,

156
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,046
other than safety,

157
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,456
I can’t guarantee you anything.

158
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,036
But,

159
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,910
being a boy

160
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,016
will enjoy a lot more

161
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,429
except for safety.

162
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,519
A boy!

163
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,770
I want to be a boy!

164
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,221
I tried to stop him
before he carried out the task.

165
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:04,495
But he still

166
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:06,855
did it anyway.

167
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,079
He made

168
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,119
his own choice.

169
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,904
He even dared to kill His Majesty.

170
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,581
Do you think he’s afraid of death?

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,079
You think too little of him.

172
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,090
Haishi tried to kill His Majesty?

173
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,075
He wanted to avenge us?

174
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,430
Master.

175
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,700
No matter what mistakes Haishi made,

176
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,239
you can’t do that to him.

177
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,120
Haishi really admires you.

178
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,091
Since he was a kid,

179
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,159
there has been nothing

180
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,960
he didn’t do exactly as you said,

181
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
no matter how trivial
and troublesome it is.

182
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,760
Do you remember

183
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,280
when he just came to Jifeng Pavilion?

184
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,119
Once you went on a mission

185
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,359
and told him
to water the orchid in your room

186
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:03,000
before you left.

187
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,520
But you were away for too long,

188
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,159
and the orchid fell ill and died.

189
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,050
But Haishi

190
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,679
still watered the orchid every day.

191
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,239
Why?

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,479
Maybe he was thinking

193
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,750
that he must do

194
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,850
what he promised you.

195
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,479
What’s more,

196
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,761
you said

197
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
training is hard.

198
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,159
Over these years,

199
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,479
Haishi never complained.

200
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,679
He wouldn’t even

201
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,799
let me complain.

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,291
Because he said

203
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,870
you are

204
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,799
the best teacher.

205
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,245
Stop saying it.

206
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,116
Master.

207
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,119
If you wanted to punish him

208
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:49,919
or hone his skills,

209
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:51,350
you could assign him

210
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,071
other tasks.

211
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,112
Why did you ask him to kill Uncle Zhao?

212
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,866
I told you to stop.

213
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,039
Master.

214
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,975
You are too cruel to Haishi.

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,632
(Jifeng Pavilion)

216
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,085
Young Master Haishi.

217
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:50,014
Shaozi.

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,101
Young Master Haishi.

219
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,181
The horse is ready.

220
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,039
You’ve just finished your work

221
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:57,119
and you only rested for one day.

222
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,398
Now you’re leaving again?

223
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,985
Master asked me to experience more.

224
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,640
I also want to check out

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,550
the shops across the state.

226
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,934
Do you want to bid farewell
to Commander?

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,679
I’m leaving.

228
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:42,735
Take care, Young Master Haishi.

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Master.

230
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,000
I’m not a good disciple.

231
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,880
I disobeyed you again and again

232
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,260
and failed your cultivation.

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
I feel ashamed

234
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:58,280
every time I think of this.

235
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,719
Now I understand your teachings.

236
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
I decided to go to Hanzhou

237
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,080
and inspect the sentries
in the courier hostels along the way.

238
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,650
I’ll manage and replenish the sentries
if it’s necessary.

239
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,440
I don’t know when I will come back.

240
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,364
May you take care of yourself.

241
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,736
Earnestly.

242
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
Your disciple, Haishi.

243
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:21,614

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,719
Commander.

258
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,200
Young Master Haishi has gone.

259
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,230
Before he left,

260
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,719
I asked him if he wanted

261
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,559
to bid farewell to you.

262
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:23,306
He didn’t say anything

263
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,280
but kowtowed

264
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:26,479
towards your room.

265
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,021
I’ve read his letter.

266
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,080
Well, it’s good for him
to venture outside.

267
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,479
It’s cold in Hanzhou.

268
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
And it’s hard to go against
His Majesty’s will.

269
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,440
Now he left.

270
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,000
I’m a little worried about him.

271
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,840
He is an outstanding talent

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,159
at his age.

273
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,599
But he is still a novice at work.

274
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,989
I’m worried he will get into trouble.

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
I’ll confess to His Majesty in person

276
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,484
and ask for punishment.

277
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,599
Well,

278
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,215
I’ll leave you alone, Master.

279
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:21,919
Zheliu.

280
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,400
Are you sure washing the gauze here

281
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,239
will make it softer?

282
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,799
I don’t know.

283
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,000
But the gauze

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
is a specialty of Zhunian,

285
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,159
and Zhunian is in the southwest.

286
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,919
The weather there
is different from it is in Tianqi.

287
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:36,400
It’s wetter and warmer there.

288
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,280
The temperature of the spring water
at Shuixin Palace

289
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,119
should be more like the water
in Zhunian.

290
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,725
Let’s give it a try first.

291
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:42,350
Um.

292
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,840
Zheliu.

293
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,080
The gauze is becoming softer!

294
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,000
The gauze is very thin.

295
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
The wind can dry it up.

296
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,960
Let’s shake it and fold it.

297
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,159
We can start to make the dress

298
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,880
for Consort Shurong when we get back.

299
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,450
Um.

300
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,400
What should we do, Zheliu?

301
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,700
The gauze flew away.

302
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,640
Will we be punished
by the Manager of Clothing

303
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,150
when we get back?

304
00:15:21,325 --> 00:15:22,479
The gauze is flying

305
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,840
in the direction of the side hall.

306
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,159
Let’s look over there first.

307
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,359
Maybe we can find it.

308
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:27,175
Um.

309
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:43,919
Zheliu.

310
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,760
Slow down.

311
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,960
I can’t keep up with you.

312
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,960
What should we do, Zheliu?

313
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,039
We’ve looked

314
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,200
everywhere we could.

315
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,119
There is no sign of it.

316
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,450
What should we do?

317
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:16,799
God of Wind.

318
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,359
You took the gauze away.

319
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,640
Please bring it back

320
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,719
to us.

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,159
If you bring the gauze back,

322
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,080
I will present you with offerings.

323
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,640
What to do, Zheliu?

324
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,479
It’s no use praying to the God of Wind.

325
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,799
We lost

326
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,719
such valuable fabric.

327
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,760
They’re gonna send us to prison.

328
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:42,840
Don’t be scared.

329
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,280
I’ll tell the Manager of Clothing

330
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,559
that I wanted to wash the gauze

331
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,760
at Shuixin Palace.

332
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,159
I’ll take the punishment.

333
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,239
Let’s go back to the Fabric Office.

334
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,479
We’ve been out for a while.

335
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,239
The Manager of Clothing

336
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:54,575
must be looking for us.

337
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:55,600
Um.

338
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:12,275
(Fabric Office)

339
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:13,880
Zheliu.

340
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,079
Is the Manager of Clothing there?

341
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:17,000
If the Manager went out purchasing,

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,719
should we go back
and keep looking for it?

343
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,800
Maybe the gauze is around the corner

344
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,439
and we didn’t notice it.

345
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,275
Let’s see
if the Manager is inside first.

346
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:26,000
Um.

347
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,375
(Fabric Office)

348
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:30,439
The gauze!

349
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,479
Look, Zheliu.

350
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,359
It’s our gauze.

351
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,520
There is no damage.

352
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,839
That’s great, Zheliu.

353
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,319
We won’t be punished.

354
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,426
Who sent back the gauze?

355
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,119
Could it be that the God of Wind

356
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,640
heard our prayer

357
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,319
and felt our sincerity,

358
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,640
so he sent back the gauze?

359
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,475
Um.

360
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,920
It must be the God of Wind.

361
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,375
Who else would

362
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,479
quietly send something so expensive

363
00:18:06,479 --> 00:18:07,319
back to the Fabric Office

364
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,920
instead of keeping it

365
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,040
and asking the Fabric Office

366
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,160
for some benefits?

367
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
And it was sent back at this time.

368
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,319
All right.

369
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,199
Let’s tidy the gauze.

370
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:16,839
We can’t

371
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,959
make any mistake this time.

372
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,725
Um.

373
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,225
(Penglai Inn)

374
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,479
Sir.

375
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,239
Here you are.

376
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:47,800
Come on.

377
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Be careful.

378
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:50,199
Come on.

379
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,304
What a handsome laddie.

380
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you want to eat here or stay over?

381
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,680
I need a room.

382
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,959
Come with me.

383
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,520
You know what,

384
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,479
you found the right place

385
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,359
to stay.

386
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,560
This is a small inn,

387
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,959
but it’s a comfortable place.

388
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,319
I guarantee
you won’t even want to go home.

389
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:11,145
Waiter.

390
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,313
Yes, Ma’am.

391
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,479
Come on, cheers.

392
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,439
Cheers.

393
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,560
This is the only inn

394
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,520
around here for miles.

395
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,959
You are having a good business.

396
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:20,800
Tell me about it.

397
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,199
We’ve run this inn for decades.

398
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:22,880
They are all regulars.

399
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,202
(Room One)

400
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,400
Room One is the best.

401
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,359
Come with me.

402
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,640
Looks like

403
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,239
you have traveled a long way.

404
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,479
Are you hungry?

405
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,280
What do you like?

406
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,650
Porridge, noodles, or steamed buns?

407
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,200
Don’t bother.

408
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,800
I only need a room to have a rest.

409
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,199
Laddie.

410
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,199
You look strong and gallant.

411
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,520
Maybe I can

412
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,160
give you a discount.

413
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,959
Laddie.

414
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,236
Let me show you the way.

415
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,880
This one.

416
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,719
This is

417
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,520
our best room

418
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,800
here.

419
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:05,199
Check it out.

420
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,839
Here is your room.

421
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,599
Take a look.

422
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,760
Let me know

423
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
if you need anything else.

424
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,950
I’ll let you rest.

425
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,218
(Inn)

426
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,320
He is asleep.

427
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:20,880
Laddie.

428
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,959
Help me!

429
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:22,920
They are robbers.

430
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,959
They robbed my inn

431
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,680
and tied me here.

432
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,239
Sir!

433
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,839
You must do justice for me.

434
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,119
He is a robber.

435
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,400
He tried to tie me here

436
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,961
and rob my inn.

437
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,375
Who is there? Get out.

438
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,456
Take him.

439
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,439
Your master

440
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,479
is getting less ambitious

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,359
to run a gangster inn and ambush people.

442
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,781
It’s an insult
to his ancestors’ reputation.

443
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,335
If you are still alive tomorrow,

444
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,905
go back and admonish your master

445
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,581
that if he keeps being a scoundrel,

446
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,079
I’ll let him pay

447
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,041
one day.

448
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,509
Why are you still standing there?

449
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,596
Master.

450
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,680
Are those people at the inn last night

451
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,950
from the Beifu Army?

452
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:53,856
Yes.

453
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,044
If he can deploy
the Beifu Army in private,

454
00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:00,920
it means he is unusual.

455
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,400
Who is he?

456
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,850
Was he the one
who tried to assassinate you

457
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,199
at the Lantern Festival last time?

458
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,165
He is an old acquaintance of mine.

459
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,009
It’s personal.

460
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,090
Don’t worry about it.

461
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:10,950
Just do

462
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,309
your own thing.

463
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:14,239
By the way,

464
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,119
there is no hurry

465
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,519
to inspect the shops.

466
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,834
Now that you’re working
for the government,

467
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,920
there are plenty of chances
to gain experience.

468
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,479
If you give up

469
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,800
assassinating His Majesty,

470
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,544
just stay at Jifeng Pavilion.

471
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,765
They’re obviously after you.

472
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,431
Be careful from now on.

473
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,641
Dress your wound.

474
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,530
Yes, Master!

475
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,560
Young Master Haishi?

476
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,525
Young Master Haishi.

477
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,599
Why are you back?

478
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,160
Have you figured it out

479
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
and decided not to go to Hanzhou?

480
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,560
It’s a good thing.

481
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:13,640
Autumn

482
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,920
is coming soon.

483
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,479
It gets cold early in Hanzhou.

484
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,160
Shaozi.

485
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,760
Master...

486
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,520
Master wouldn’t
kill people for no reason,

487
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,670
right?

488
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:30,765
That’s great

489
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,680
you think in this way.

490
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,439
Actually, I wanted to talk to you

491
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,079
about this a long time ago.

492
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,239
Although it looked like

493
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,199
Uncle Zhao had been all alone
these years,

494
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,560
he had a nephew

495
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,199
in his hometown in the north.

496
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,959
That’s the orphan child

497
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,119
of his only brother.

498
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,040
Uncle Zhao

499
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,100
would secretly send some silver

500
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,479
to his nephew

501
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,079
in his northern hometown every year.

502
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
But it was found by the spies of Huku.

503
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,800
They seized Uncle Zhao’s nephew

504
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,599
and used his life
to threaten Uncle Zhao

505
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,319
to send messages for them.

506
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,979
We have all the evidence.

507
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,000
Although he did it under duress,

508
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,625
there are laws and rules.

509
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,000
Uncle Zhao couldn’t get away with it.

510
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:14,239
Commander agreed to his resignation.

511
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,400
Then he asked you

512
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,640
to punish him.

513
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,920
We told other people

514
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,160
that Uncle Zhao died of an old illness,

515
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:24,175
because it’s the only way

516
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,119
to save Uncle Zhao’s

517
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,975
only nephew

518
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,920
and let him live his life.

519
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,400
Young Master Haishi.

520
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,781
I know there are some things

521
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,079
that are hard to let go of,

522
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,189
but things change.

523
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,711
There’s still a long way to go.

524
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,160
(Fabric Office)

525
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,319
Why doesn’t she come out?

526
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,890
I saw Miss Zheliu in the morning.

527
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,160
I think she went to the Shuixin Palace

528
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,239
to wash gauze.

529
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,280
Why didn’t you tell us about it?

530
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Are you a fool?

531
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:02,400
I was on duty at that time.

532
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
I saw her from a distance.

533
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,040
If I told you,

534
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,280
the guys on the watch

535
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,199
would get crazy.

536
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,000
Stop it.

537
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,575
I’m waiting for Miss Zheliu.

538
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,325
Sir.

539
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,425
Sir.

540
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:17,640
What are you guys doing here?

541
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,880
We are here to familiarize ourselves

542
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,839
with the place,

543
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,079
so we can

544
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,959
do a good job when we are on duty.

545
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,040
Yes. Yes.

546
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:34,959
Familiarize yourselves with the place?

547
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,500
If I remember correctly,

548
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,839
you’ve been working in the Palace

549
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:39,640
for three years.

550
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,439
You’ve been there
for two and a half years,

551
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,079
and you’ve been there
for almost two years.

552
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,280
If you still need to know the place

553
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,479
after working here for so long,

554
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,611
then your time here is all wasted.

555
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,839
Sir.

556
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,000
It’s my fault.

557
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:53,920
From now on,

558
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,079
you go to guard the West Side Gate.

559
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,920
You two take your shift
at the West Corner Gate.

560
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,920
Private dealings
are strictly forbidden in the Palace.

561
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,160
If I find you

562
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,350
near the Fabric Office again,

563
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,160
I’ll punish you with due severity.

564
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,850
Yes.

565
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,640
Go ahead now.

566
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,246
Let’s go.

567
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,050
God of Wind.

568
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,439
Thank you for bringing the gauze back

569
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,825
to the North Palace

570
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:27,640
and saving me from punishment.

571
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,959
I specially

572
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,520
made some pomegranate cakes for you

573
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,160
with the dried pomegranate
I brought from my hometown.

574
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,675
God of Wind,
please accept such a little gift.

575
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,479
I will keep in mind

576
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,975
your kindness

577
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:41,479
and always respect you.

578
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,359
Zheliu.

579
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,750
What’s the matter?

580
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,719
Zheliu.

581
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,475
Look at the outdated pattern.

582
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:54,000
Is it suitable to embroider it
on the hemline?

583
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
I said no,

584
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,950
but Xiaochun said
this is the only suitable pattern.

585
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,880
If it’s for Aunt Rong,

586
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,839
you should use this one.

587
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,800
This one is good.

588
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I’ll embroider it right away.

589
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,520
You have the best taste.

590
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,675
Xiaochun is nowhere near you.

591
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,920
You asked the cook
to make roast duck again?

592
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,480
No.

593
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:10,446
I smelled it.

594
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,800
There is a plate of roast duck.

595
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,359
But when I saw you,

596
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,925
I feel embarrassed to take it out.

597
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,640
When you play the zither,

598
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,319
you look like an immortal
from a distance.

599
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,359
An immortal, of course,

600
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,800
won’t eat roast duck.

601
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,560
So,

602
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,665
it’s my fault.

603
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,760
It’s the roast duck’s fault.

604
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,000
No.

605
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,439
Things are complicated.

606
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,000
From now on, I should

607
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,239
think twice before I act

608
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,640
and not just look at
what’s on the surface.

609
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,040
I won’t fail you.

610
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,920
So, do you forgive me?

611
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,900
Where is this place?

612
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,959
The three yang meridians of hand.

613
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,560
What will happen if they break?

614
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,000
At best you can’t practice martial arts,

615
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,760
or at worst you will be disabled.

616
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,319
If you know it,

617
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:31,640
why don’t you apply medicine?

618
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,155
Go back to your room
and reflect on yourself.

619
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,189
Thank you, Master.

620
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,181
I won’t bother you then.

621
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,221
Hold on.

622
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,439
Your skills are poor

623
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:49,239
and you still fool around.

624
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:52,075
Start training tomorrow.

625
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:53,839
Don’t slack off.

626
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:56,359
Got it, Master.

627
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,119
And also,

628
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,439
take this plate of roast duck away.

629
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,520
Are you not going to try it?

630
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,319
Take it away.

631
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,919
Leave some space here.

632
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,280
Or the next line

633
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,475
will make it look crowded.

634
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,719
Um, got it.

635
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,479
Zheliu.

636
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,591
We’ve been embroidering all day.

637
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:31,520
Yeah.

638
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,399
Zheliu.

639
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,760
We are too tired.

640
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,399
Let’s rest for a while.

641
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,479
Yeah.

642
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,120
I can barely lift my arms.

643
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,000
The Manager is not here anyway.

644
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
Yeah, Zheliu.

645
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,575
Yeah.

646
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:43,399
- Let’s take a break.
- The Manager is not here anyway.

647
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,159
Let’s rest for a while.

648
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,199
Yeah.

649
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,458
Let’s take a break.

650
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,399
Just for a while.

651
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,280
- All right, all right.
- Just for a while.

652
00:34:50,225 --> 00:34:52,346
Make sure you put away
the needles and threads.

653
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:52,950
Um.

654
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,231
Let’s go.

655
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,925
Turns out God of Wind

656
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,320
likes the pomegranate cakes I made.

657
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,120
I’ll often make cakes

658
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,425
for you from now on.

659
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,275
God of Wind, please bless

660
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,479
these young girls

661
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,479
and let them improve faster.

662
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,199
If they improve faster,

663
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,250
they can help Aunt and me.

664
00:35:36,075 --> 00:35:36,919
And also,

665
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,320
I’m embroidering an official robe

666
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
for the new Bowmen Commandant.

667
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,000
I hope this Commandant

668
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,719
would like the robe I make.

669
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:28,644
Master?

670
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,100
Eyes on the center.

671
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,006
Master.

672
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,719
After I left that day,

673
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,520
did you follow me all the way there

674
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,159
because you worried about me?

675
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:40,814
If you think about yourself
all the time,

676
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,621
you will miss the target.

677
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Be aware of the wound.

678
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,315
Got it, Master!

679
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,175
Zhuoying.

680
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,080
What?

681
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,439
You’ve been giggling
since you walked into the yard.

682
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,760
Why are you giggling?

683
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:02,850
What are you hiding?

684
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,000
Why should I tell you?

685
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,959
What are you

686
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,320
doing with this feather?

687
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,040
I...

688
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,280
I think the feather is light.

689
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,879
It can be used to make fletching.

690
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,800
You look cheerful.

691
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,080
What’s the good news?

692
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,871
I forgave Master.

693
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,719
You forgave Master?

694
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,520
I think it’s Master who forgave you.

695
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,446
You are spineless.

696
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,280
A few days ago,
you looked like you had an epiphany

697
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,150
and you were going to be a nun.

698
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,925
Master just said a few nice words,

699
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,360
and look how happy you are now.

700
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,475
Don’t touch me.

701
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:35,235
Gross.

702
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:36,959
But you

703
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,439
didn’t even have lunch today.

704
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,999
Are you supposed to be on duty today?

705
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,239
Why do you look like

706
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,159
you have a crush on someone?

707
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,080
By the way,

708
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,349
someone told me today

709
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:48,679
that His Majesty decreed

710
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,025
you should take
the imperial examination this year.

711
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,000
Your Majesty.

712
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,314
This is the directory of the examinees
for the imperial joust.

713
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,080
Mr. Su.

714
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,864
You are the chief examiner
in the imperial joust this time.

715
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,479
Thank you for your hard work.

716
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,959
Thank you, Your Majesty.

717
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,760
I will be loyal and faithful

718
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
and do my best.

719
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,625
Good. Fall back.

720
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:19,800
Tang Qianzi.

721
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,919
Yes.

722
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,750
Did you go back

723
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,850
to your hometown to visit your family?

724
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,679
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

725
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,679
I haven’t returned to my hometown
for decades.

726
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,679
When I went back this time,

727
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,879
my family was happy to see me.

728
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,239
The Huangquan Pass
is an important place in the north.

729
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,919
Now that you’ve finished
your personal affairs,

730
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,250
you should take your troops
to garrison it.

731
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,040
Well...

732
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,959
How can he do that?

733
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,315
It’s disrespectful.

734
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,040
You took a nap again?

735
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,320
I’m foolish.

736
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,790
Please punish me.

737
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,471
Do you have anything else to report?

738
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,800
We have nothing else to report.

739
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,879
Then that’s all for today.

740
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,760
Leave the court!

741
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,639
Good day, Your Majesty.

742
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,875
I heard that Fang Haishi sorted out
the household registration.

743
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,479
I’m curious

744
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,080
if he can

745
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,719
come out on top

746
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,950
like Fang Zhuoying did.

747
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,819
He is not strong enough.

748
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:32,600
I think

749
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,919
he’s better than Fang Zhuoying.

750
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,040
Fang Zhuoying is too dull

751
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,879
to make any interesting noise.

752
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,040
I expect to see him in the court.

753
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:44,125
During the imperial examination,

754
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,390
I will strengthen
the defense of the capital

755
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,719
to make sure nothing will go wrong.

756
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,925
Where’s the fun if nothing goes wrong?

757
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,040
Boring.

758
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:15,504
Haishi.

759
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:17,845
Master.

760
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:21,875
You want to see me?

761
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,239
Sit down.

762
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,481
Let me do it.

763
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,639
Master.

764
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,741
Did you just go to the Palace?

765
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
You are here

766
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,300
to ask me about that?

767
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,359
Zhuoying told me

768
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:15,520
that His Majesty picked me
to take the imperial examination.

769
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,520
You don’t need to do it.

770
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,120
I turned it down for you.

771
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,721
It’s not like that.

772
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,239
I was overwhelmed

773
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,560
when I first heard it.

774
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,000
But,

775
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:26,674
I want to do it.

776
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,970
You want to do it?

777
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,411
For His Majesty?

778
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,650
Not entirely because of him.

779
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,959
I also want to know

780
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:37,479
if my archery and horsemanship
are good enough.

781
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,455
There are too many barriers
in the imperial examination.

782
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,166
You’re in an inconvenient position.

783
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,840
But you can take it if you want.

784
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,871
Is there anything else?

785
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,434
You know

786
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,681
His Majesty will be there
during the imperial examination.

787
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,606
Why do you still allow me
to get near him?

788
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,470
This is His Majesty’s will.

789
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:17,066
And also,

790
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,560
you promised me

791
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,239
you won’t assassinate His Majesty.

792
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,900
I trust you.

793
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,870
As long as he makes an order,

794
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,540
will you always obey?

795
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,375
The world is big.

796
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,980
Thanks to His Majesty,

797
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,630
Dazheng is able to achieve
what it has today.

798
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:36,040
But if it hadn’t been

799
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,080
for his decree

800
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,719
of exorbitant pearl taxes,

801
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,201
not so many people
would have died wrongly,

802
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,199
and I wouldn’t have

803
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,600
lost my father because of that.

804
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,709
The nation is not just about one man.

805
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:48,995
There are too many joints

806
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,540
between the orders and the actions.

807
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,570
You’ll figure it out in time.

808
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:55,705
Just focus on
the imperial examination first.

809
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:57,760
Rest assured, Master.

810
00:43:57,975 --> 00:43:59,625
I will do my best

811
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,651
to prepare for the imperial examination.

812
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:06,764
I’m gonna go practice now.

813
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,911
I’m leaving.

814
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,641
Be aware of the wound on your arm.

815
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,439
I applied the medicine you gave me.

816
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:19,675
It’s much better now.

817
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:49,984
Haishi.

818
00:44:50,275 --> 00:44:51,199
Don’t you always

819
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,375
hit the target every time?

820
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,840
Why are you doing badly today?

821
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,080
You’re just in time.

822
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,760
Come over.

823
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,439
What?

824
00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:58,000
I have things to do in the Palace.

825
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You’re not on duty today.

826
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,360
What are you doing in the Palace?

827
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,275
I have things to do anyway.

828
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,679
Are you going to see the consorts?

829
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,399
I...

830
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,509
What nonsense are you talking about?

831
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,940
What consorts?

832
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,280
His Majesty

833
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,479
has had mood swings lately.

834
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,320
These consorts

835
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,399
have been suffering.

836
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,719
Of course,

837
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,119
I haven’t mentioned Princess Tilan.

838
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,080
Since you made a scene
in the Forbidden City last time,

839
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,280
His Majesty has grounded Princess Tilan

840
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,639
in Yu’an Palace.

841
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:23,600
However,

842
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,000
I think

843
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:26,959
it’s a good thing
that he doesn’t go to see her.

844
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,325
I was talking about

845
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,159
collecting all the playthings
in Tianqi for her

846
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,850
so that she can

847
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,559
kill time with them.

848
00:45:34,925 --> 00:45:36,239
If I didn’t know

849
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,199
your situation,

850
00:45:37,399 --> 00:45:38,360
I would take you

851
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,479
as a romantic lover.

852
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,360
What’s so good about Princess Tilan?

853
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,959
Why do you care about her so much?

854
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,679
You won’t understand

855
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,840
the friendship between girls.

856
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:48,479
Where do you look like a girl?

857
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,850
Fang Zhuoying.

858
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:50,600
Get here.

859
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,425
Why?

860
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:52,959
I want to ask you something.

861
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Tell me

862
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,439
what the imperial examination is about

863
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:56,719
when you came out on top

864
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,639
three years ago.

865
00:45:57,639 --> 00:45:58,850
What should I prepare?

866
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,600
That’s it?

867
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,080
That’s the most important thing
right now.

868
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,641
Good girl.

869
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,199
The imperial examination is divided into

870
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:08,376
the primary election, the metropolitan
exam and the palace exam.

871
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,120
You were chosen by His Majesty.

872
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,350
You don’t need
to take the primary election.

873
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:11,850
Um.

874
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,719
Next is the metropolitan exam,

875
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:13,760
and then the palace exam.

876
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,159
The metropolitan exam
and the palace exam

877
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:16,520
will be held in the capital.

878
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,959
From the metropolitan exam
to the palace exam,

879
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,320
there are three subjects to be tested.

880
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,560
Which three?

881
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,199
The specific details

882
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,439
are different every year.

883
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,000
But let me tell you,

884
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,879
don’t just practice

885
00:46:26,879 --> 00:46:27,850
martial arts every day.

886
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,320
There are also many people
from the Military Academy

887
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,439
attending the metropolitan exam.

888
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:31,399
Those people will ask you questions

889
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:32,879
about Confucian argumentation
and political affairs.

890
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,360
That’s also part of the exam?

891
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,080
Of course.

892
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,800
They are selecting a general,

893
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,159
not a warrior.

894
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,000
What if they select

895
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,159
someone with all brawn

896
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:40,919
and no brains?

897
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,639
Seems that you need
to be quite knowledgeable

898
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:43,879
to come out on top

899
00:46:43,879 --> 00:46:45,360
in the imperial examination.

900
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,919
How did you

901
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:49,520
get selected then?

902
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,040
What do you mean?

903
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,000
During

904
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,800
the Shangsi Festival last year,

905
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,959
there were girls and young women

906
00:46:57,959 --> 00:46:59,159
throwing fruits into my cart.

907
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
How do I become a brute

908
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,520
in your mouth?

909
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,959
Throw fruits into your cart?

910
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:05,360
That was because

911
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,159
you were in the cart of Marquis Wuxiang.

912
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,840
I heard that his fourteenth son,
Zhou Youdu,

913
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,000
is handsome and graceful.

914
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,199
Everyone in the state admires him.

915
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,600
With his talent and good appearance,

916
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,280
if he had not been with you,

917
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,199
the fruits he received
would have filled several carts.

918
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,399
You look down on me.

919
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:21,959
I won’t teach you.

920
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,718
Come on. Teach me.

921
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:25,325
Haishi.

922
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,600
Master.

923
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,225
Ah?

924
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,919
I’ll go to the toilet.

925
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:30,325
