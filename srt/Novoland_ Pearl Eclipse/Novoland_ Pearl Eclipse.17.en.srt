25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,479
Your Majesty, it’s ready.

26
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,759
No appetite.

27
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,919
How about

28
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,080
I ask them to prepare something else?

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
Don’t bother.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
It’s exhausting

31
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,520
to do it again.

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,759
Don’t set such a precedent.

33
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,440
I need some fresh air.

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,440
Your Highness, have some rest.

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,759
Your eyes must be tired.

37
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,240
I’m fine. Just give me some more time.

38
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,759
Your Highness, you’ve been reading

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,279
this book for days

40
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,440
and never put it down.

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,440
Is it really that interesting?

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,960
The storybooks in Dazheng

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,039
are really interesting.

44
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,960
What is it about?

45
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,119
Please tell me about it.

46
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,600
I want to know it, too.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
This book is about

48
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,399
a charming young lady,

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,839
who disguised herself as a man
to go to school,

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,919
and

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,160
fell in love with her schoolmate.

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Disguised herself as a man
to go to school

53
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,839
and didn’t keep a distance from others?

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,279
It’s against the ethic.

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
How bold she is!

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,359
She fell in love with her schoolmate.

57
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,160
Did the schoolmate
fall in love with her as well?

58
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,839
Of course, he liked her.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
One day the boy noticed that

60
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,119
there were traces of rings

61
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,959
in the girl’s ears.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,239
He asked,

63
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,160
“If you are not a girl,

64
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,359
why do you have earrings?”

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,559
She got caught?

66
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,600
I guess not.

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,679
Why not?

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
How could a man wear earrings?

69
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,079
She didn’t get caught.

70
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,040
She is really a smart girl.

71
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,480
She said,

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,399
“There is a reason for it.

73
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Don’t feel suspicious.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,079
In those temple fairs,

75
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,040
I’m always asked to dress up
as Avalokitesvara.”

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,200
Wait right here.

77
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,320
What’s more,

78
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
she even recriminated.

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,959
Wait here.

80
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,559
“Be concentrated on your article.

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,519
How could you think of women
instead of your future?”

82
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,880
She is so smart!

83
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,559
Then, what did the boy say?

84
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,880
- He said…
- He said he dared not see Avalokitesvara again.

85
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,640
Your Majesty.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,480
You’re enjoying the moon here?

88
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,920
Yes.

89
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,239
I saw no one around.

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,920
But I didn’t expect to
disturb Your Majesty.

91
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,079
Please forgive me.

92
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,079
I didn’t realize

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,359
there was

94
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,559
such a storybook in the Palace.

95
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,079
I’m reckless.

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,559
I’m not supposed to read this.

97
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,359
Rise.

98
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,640
Yes.

99
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,799
I’ve read it before.

100
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,320
But I don’t remember
what happened next.

101
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,799
Since you got time,

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
tell me about it.

103
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,559
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,000
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,359
What?

106
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,399
You’re not willing to tell it

107
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,079
before others?

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,959
You two, step aside.

109
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,519
Your Majesty, it’s cold out here.

110
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,399
How about going back

111
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,480
to Yu’an Palace with Her Highness?

112
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,679
Alright.

113
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,399
Go ahead.

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,799
Your Majesty, which chapter
do you want to listen to?

115
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,279
Just start

116
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:02,519
from the part

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
where you stopped.

118
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,119
Go on.

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,440
The girl

120
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,119
fell in love with the boy

121
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,000
and pretended to have a sister at home

122
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,160
who looked just like herself.

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,079
They had an appointment

124
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,959
that half a year later,

125
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,399
the boy would go to the girl’s home

126
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,480
to marry her sister.

127
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,679
His family has settled down.

128
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,200
When the time is not right,
it will be a disaster.

129
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,320
You’ve already dealt with

130
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,559
four of the Six Wing Generals.

131
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,839
Jianming, you’ve done a good job.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,640
Tell me

133
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,320
what you want for reward.

134
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,640
The Six Wing Generals helped
to conquer the world.

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,679
There were five left

136
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,880
after my false death.

137
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
A few peaceful years have passed,

138
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,080
and only Su Ming is left now.

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,679
He has always been loyal

140
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,559
and his father died because of me.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,919
I beg you

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,960
to at least keep Su Ming alive.

143
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,359
I didn’t expect that

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,960
our companions
who were with us through hardships

145
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,880
didn’t fall in the Rebellion of Price Yi,

146
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,799
but in the hands of you and me

147
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,000
in this peaceful time.

148
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,520
I promise you

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,159
I will not kill Su Ming

150
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,520
until the last moment.

151
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,440
Your Majesty?

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Who is it?

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,080
Your Majesty!

154
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,239
Your Majesty,

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,039
I… I’m Tilan.

156
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,799
Your Majesty, you look sleepy.

157
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,559
You must be exhausted from
your heavy work during the day.

158
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:54,080
How about going back for sleep?

159
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,400
I’m fine.

160
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,200
Keep on reading.

161
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Yes.

162
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,080
I’m not asleep.

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
Don’t stop there.

164
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,799
Your Majesty.

165
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,599
Your Majesty?

166
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,039
Time to get up.

167
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,559
Your Majesty,

168
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,840
I brought your court dress here.

169
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:09,960
Help me change.

170
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,280
Yes.

171
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
What’s wrong?

172
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,000
Please allow me to help you.

173
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,919
I was too tired last night

174
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,880
and Yu’an Palace was near.

175
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,039
I didn’t expect

176
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,119
to spend the whole night here.

177
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,799
You’re good at reading

178
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,239
but so clumsy at dressing.

179
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,599
See you, Your Majesty.

180
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,719
What time is it now?

181
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,119
Your Majesty, eight in the morning.

182
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,919
It’s too late.

183
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,159
I can’t slack off next time

184
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,159
and rest in Yu’an Palace.

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,760
It’s too far away from Zichen Hall.

186
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,719
I’m about to be late for court.

187
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,080
Your Majesty,

188
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,039
I’ve arranged to meet

189
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,039
the carriage from Lanzi

190
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,479
down the road.

191
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,320
It will reach Tianqi City soon.

192
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,000
Your Majesty,

193
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,440
the war in the southwest subsided.

194
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,200
Chen Heran, the governor of Xiping Port,

195
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,520
reported that the trade

196
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,440
and commerce had almost been restored,

197
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,280
except for Nihualuo and Tuhuolu,

198
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,559
which were temporarily closed

199
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,000
due to the war.

200
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,520
Your Majesty,

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,159
there is a severe cold
in the north this year.

202
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Many refugees have flooded
into Quanming Port,

203
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,559
and the harvest of Quanming Port

204
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,919
is not as good as in previous years.

205
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,760
The governor of Quanming Port

206
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,640
is applying for opening the warehouse
to help the people.

207
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,799
Your Majesty,

208
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,640
Xiping Port suffered

209
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,960
a war when enemies from

210
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,880
Nihualuo and Tuhuolu

211
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,559
disguised themselves

212
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,200
as merchants.

213
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,799
Quanming Port

214
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,960
is the only port

215
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,919
to Hanzhou and Shangzhou.

216
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,359
In order to avoid people from Huku,

217
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,000
please think twice about the matter

218
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,239
of opening the warehouse, Your Majesty.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
It makes sense.

220
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,559
Those registered in Dazheng

221
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,479
are our people.

222
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,760
We can’t let the people

223
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
of Dazheng starve.

224
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,280
It’s imperative to help them.

225
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,840
We just need to be careful.

226
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:51,919
All of you,

227
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
anyone is

228
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,679
willing to go there

229
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,719
to deal with it?

230
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,119
- Well…
- Well…

231
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:05,119
This is an important thing.

232
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,080
But now

233
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,200
Lord Qinghai is still at Huangquan Pass.

234
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,039
Who can be better to govern

235
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,960
the Quanming Port than Lord Qinghai?

236
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,000
Your Majesty,

237
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,799
according to the status,

238
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,000
it would be more appropriate for

239
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,080
Lord Chang to represent Your Majesty
at Quanming Port.

240
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
Jichang!

241
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,719
Are you willing to go to Quanming Port?

242
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,039
Forget it.

243
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,119
Your Majesty,

244
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,919
I’m willing to settle it down.

245
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,919
This is no small matter.

246
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,039
I will live up to Your Majesty’s order.

247
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
During the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,080
your father Su Jingfei died
in the battle.

249
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,280
You also went with me to fight

250
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,559
north and south
regardless of your safety

251
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,119
and made outstanding merits.

252
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,799
If you’re willing to take charge…

253
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,760
Su Ming, take the order.

254
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,840
Su Ming, reinstated as
General for Stability,

256
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,599
set out for Quanming Port today

257
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,320
and take charge of the relief.

258
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,280
I, Su Ming,
thank for Your Majesty’s grace.

259
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:51,800
(Tianqi)

260
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,119
General,

261
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,640
His Majesty has given orders

262
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,719
that there’s no need to take leave.

263
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,479
It’s a long trip to Quanming Port.

264
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,319
Let’s set out as soon as possible.

265
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,040
I, Su Ming, will never

266
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,280
forget Your Majesty’s kindness.

267
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,119
Long live Your Majesty!

268
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,000
Your Majesty,

269
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,000
General Su had left the north gate

270
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,640
and was heading for Quanming Port.

271
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
Before leaving,

272
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,640
General Su knelt down and wept

273
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,319
outside the gate.

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
It wouldn’t be like this
if he had known it earlier.

275
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,959
Step down.

276
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
I want this.

277
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,040
The Left Tribe of Huku

278
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,520
attacked Well Town.

279
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,800
And the Right Tribe

280
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,839
was well aware of my whereabouts.

281
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:08,800
Go into the city tomorrow

282
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,599
and see if you can find any leads.

283
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,800
Be careful.

284
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,560
There was no one

285
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,880
in the shop when I got there.

286
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,479
It was like a deliberate mess.

287
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,359
No favorable evidence was found.

288
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,439
So were the other shops.

289
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,680
That means

290
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,920
something must be wrong

291
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,520
in Huangquan Battalion.

292
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,599
The Left and Right Tribes of Huku

293
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,239
were temporarily defeated,

294
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,839
but Poduona and Qiduoli of Huku

295
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,920
are greedy.

296
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,079
We have to keep on our guard.

297
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,680
It’s a matter of the safety
of Huangquan Pass.

298
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,239
We can’t act rashly.

299
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,800
We have our guess,

300
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,439
but we should keep our mouths shut.

301
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,880
There’s another big thing.

302
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,880
Su Ming asked to go to Quanming Port

303
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,319
to assist the relief.

304
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
His Majesty has granted him.

305
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,479
Once he gets out of Quanming Port,

306
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,800
he can bypass Huangquan Pass

307
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,359
and go to Shangzhou and Hanzhou by sea.

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I fear that

309
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,119
Su Ming will escape.

310
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,880
If only now we could

311
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,079
prove that Su Ming is

312
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,319
in league with the enemy.

313
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,719
His Majesty is generous.

314
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,479
If we find out

315
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,920
this matter is related to Su Ming,

316
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,199
I certainly won’t let him go.

317
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,599
What should we do next?

318
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,400
Please give me instructions.

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,040
Keep checking on the shops.

320
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,280
And…

321
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,719
Go now.

322
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes, My Lord.

323
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,239
The medicine is ready.

324
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,119
Let me.

325
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,280
Is he

326
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,920
still not better today?

327
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,319
Don’t worry.

328
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,119
He will be fine.

329
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,079
How is Mr. Fang?

330
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,280
Heaven rewards the good.

331
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,119
Mr. Fang will get well.

332
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,160
Please don’t worry too much.

333
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,760
But looks like

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
he is not

335
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,119
getting better these days.

336
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,000
It’s a full moon tonight.

337
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,199
Everyone is praying

338
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,359
for him under the moon.

339
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:56,040
- Dear Immortal, please show mercy!
- Dear Immortal, please show mercy!

340
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,000
Dear Immortal…

341
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,000
Mr. Zhang.

342
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,640
Mr. Fu.

343
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,119
After hearing that Mr. Fang
was seriously injured,

344
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,119
and Lord Qinghai has not returned,

345
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,959
General Tang sent me to

346
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:42,800
come to visit

347
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,520
and bring the military physician here.

348
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Mr. Zhang, you were out on a patrol?

349
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,479
I just went to the kitchen.

350
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,640
Since Mr. Fu is here,

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,280
have you met Lord Qinghai?

352
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,000
I have been here for a while.

353
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,319
But I haven’t met him.

354
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:58,560
Maybe Lord Qinghai is busy now.

355
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,599
Please wait a moment.

356
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,880
I’ll go have a check.

357
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,839
Thanks.

358
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,920
Raven?

359
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,199
It’s raven.

360
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,680
Only the Su Family

361
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,199
takes raven as the messenger.

362
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,280
My Lord, what to do next?

363
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
Send a message to Zhuoying,

364
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,400
and tell him to bring Su Ming

365
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,359
back to Tianqi City.

366
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,680
What if he can’t?

367
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,040
Then kill Su Ming right away.

368
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,680
His Majesty intends to let him live.

369
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,079
If we kill him

370
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,280
without report,

371
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,800
it will alienate you and His Majesty.

372
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,199
I will explain it

373
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,319
to His Majesty.

374
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,599
Yes.

375
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,520
What about the spy that was sent back?

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,000
Remains the same.

377
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,040
I want to see who else

378
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,239
has an axe to grind besides Su Ming.

379
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,119
I have got the silver ganoderma

380
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,119
you asked me to get from the shop

381
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,400
at Huangquan Pass.

382
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:00,959
Besides,

383
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,000
Fu Yi has been waiting outside.

384
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Leave the ganoderma.

385
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,040
As for Fu Yi,

386
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:09,479
ask Salia to treat him for me.

387
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,800
I will say that you’re thinking

388
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,839
about how to conquer Huku

389
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,239
and we will inform Tang Qianzi

390
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,160
if the plan is formed.

391
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,280
The weather is cold.

392
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,280
Gentlemen,

393
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,319
drinking is the best way to keep warm.

394
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,199
Please.

395
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,199
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

396
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,959
It has long been said that

397
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,599
the Jiamanese are not only
good at making wine,

398
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,880
but also good at drinking.

399
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,640
From children at 10

400
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,079
to elders at 80,

401
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,439
they can all drink.

402
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,880
Seems like it’s true.

403
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,000
Please don’t believe
the exaggerated rumors.

404
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Please drink as much as you want.

405
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,280
I will take food as wine.

406
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,640
Please.

407
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:02,520
Lord Qinghai only led dozens of soldiers

408
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,040
and thousands of Jiamanese

409
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,199
to drive out the main force
of the Right Tribe of Huku

410
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,599
and capture the city of Lanzi.

411
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
That’s really amazing!

412
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,400
But it’s a pity that

413
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,959
Mr. Fang got injured

414
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,719
and couldn’t drink with us.

415
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:17,920
Mr. Fang is not

416
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:18,839
in serious condition now.

417
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,079
He just needs some more rest.

418
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,560
That’s great.

419
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,160
God blesses him.

420
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,680
During the war,

421
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,959
if it were not for Mr. Fang

422
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,959
and all the soldiers
of Huangquan Battalion,

423
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:32,640
Jiamanese would not have

424
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,079
driven out the Huku people.

425
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
A toast to you two.

426
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,119
Cheers.

427
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,599
Earlji

428
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,079
was indeed a debauched man.

429
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,079
He is doomed to be banished.

430
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,040
I have also heard that

431
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,359
when he was in Lanzi,

432
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
he had not only taken a group
of women with him,

433
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,560
but had also appointed

434
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,520
a Davana of unknown origin,

435
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
named Tidi.

436
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,040
This Tidi…

437
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,400
Earlji was indeed fatuous.

438
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
But I have once seen

439
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,760
this Davana.

440
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
She was indeed more beautiful

441
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:06,479
than normal women.

442
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,800
But when Earlji fell,

443
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,079
the Davana died

444
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,199
in the chaos

445
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,839
as we took Lanzi.

446
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,079
Beauties always

447
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
end up with tragedy.

448
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,839
It was indeed a pity

449
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,479
for such a beauty.

450
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,959
Humans are nothing on the battlefield.

451
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,439
It’s hard to avoid.

452
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,959
Mr. Fu, it’s a little bit

453
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,280
disappointing to say this now.

454
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,040
Come on. Cheers.

455
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,640
Cheers.

456
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,239
Stop.

457
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,640
General,

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,800
are you tired?

459
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,640
There is a Postal Relay Station
not far ahead.

460
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,160
General?

461
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,400
Our men have been unable to get close

462
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,479
to the spy taken to Tianqi City.

463
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:25,040
It’s hard to find it out.

464
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,959
But Fang Jianming

465
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,000
seems to have got the evidence

466
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,599
of we sending messages

467
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,319
to Huku.

468
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,520
What?

469
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,760
But…

470
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,800
Our people in Lanzi

471
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,560
had already left

472
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,520
before Fang Jianming arrived,

473
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,920
didn’t they?

474
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,920
It’s the only flaw in our plan.

475
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,760
Our family is

476
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,479
the only one who uses ravens

477
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,520
to send messages in Dazheng.

478
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,839
If this is true,

479
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,800
whatever His Majesty does,

480
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,719
Fang Jianming

481
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,280
will never let me go.

482
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,839
General,

483
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,400
should we ask Wu Qi

484
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,880
to give up the pursuit
of the captured assassin

485
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,119
and come to protect you?

486
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,680
Even if Wu Qi leads all the elites,

487
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,560
how can he stand up to

488
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,199
the assassins of the Secret Force?

489
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,119
It would be better to let them

490
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,719
stay in Tianqi City

491
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,479
and act as planned.

492
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,680
I can make a diversion.

493
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,560
What’s more,

494
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,079
he needs to keep an eye on Ju Qiqi.

495
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,439
He won’t act rashly.

496
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,640
General,

497
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,239
are we still heading for Quanming Port?

498
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,239
I’m afraid that

499
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,680
Fang Jianming will lay an ambush

500
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,800
in Quanming Port.

501
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,160
We can’t go there.

502
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,760
Go along the Silt River

503
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,959
to the sea from Juzi

504
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,680
and go to the Left Tribe of Hanzhou
from Lax Sea.

505
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
Yes, General.

506
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,520
Flank ahead to Juzi!

507
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,359
The weather is too cold.

508
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,880
Shuixin Palace is the only place

509
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
in the capital

510
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,560
that has fireflies.

511
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,959
What if she doesn’t like them?

512
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,199
She has been

513
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,359
unhappy these days.

514
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,920
Should I go and persuade her?

515
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:36,680
Zheliu,

516
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,239
I’m the God of Wind.

517
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,839
If she knows that

518
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,199
I always eavesdrop on her

519
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,280
on the roof,

520
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,760
she must be so angry.

521
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,280
Zhuoying.

522
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,319
Shaozi.

523
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,640
Here is Lord’s order.

524
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,959
When should I set out?

525
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,040
I’ll send someone to get
all the information,

526
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,719
including the routes and lodgings.

527
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,000
You just need to get prepared.

528
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,319
Set out tomorrow morning.

529
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:18,880
Alright.

530
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,280
Is that you,

531
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,119
Mr. God of Wind?

532
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:21,599
So, it’s just a passing bird.

533
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,040
God of Wind,

534
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,079
thank you for

535
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,560
everything.

536
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,959
Zheliu,

537
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,439
after I come back,

538
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,520
I will meet you in person.

539
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,639
Lord Qinghai,

540
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,320
is he getting better after

541
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,639
having the silver ganoderma?

542
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,360
Lord, urgent intelligence.

543
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,080
We just got the news that

544
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,760
Su Ming didn’t go to Quanming Port.

545
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,520
His team went to Dumulan City

546
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,320
and the area of Juzi

547
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:38,560
and then disappeared.

548
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,479
Oh, no.

549
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,120
He is escaping to Shangzhou

550
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,919
or the Left Tribe of Huku in Hanzhou.

551
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:47,959
What about Zhuoying?

552
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,439
Young Master Zhuoying just got the order

553
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,239
and set out from Tianqi City
not long ago.

554
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,719
I’m afraid Su Ming has

555
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,320
got some news.

556
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,479
He will definitely speed up

557
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,520
and flee in panic.

558
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,919
If he goes along Silt River

559
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,959
to Lax Sea from Juzi,

560
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,919
it will take Young Master Zhuoying

561
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,280
some time to catch up with him.

562
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,919
But if we stop him from Huangquan Pass,

563
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,439
it will save a lot of time.

564
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,080
If we don’t catch him in time

565
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,000
and he goes to Lax Sea

566
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,800
and Shangzhou,

567
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:10,199
we’ll lose him,

568
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,719
laying by trouble for the future!

569
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,600
Take people to stop Su Ming

570
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,479
immediately.

571
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,360
Mr. Fang!

572
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,719
- Mr. Fang! What’s wrong?
- Yes.

573
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,040
Haishi!

574
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,479
Mama Hezi!

575
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,879
Mr. Fang is dying!

576
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,280
Please give me the panacea!

577
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,560
It’s the most precious panacea

578
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,800
of Jiaman’s Royal Family.

579
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,439
It’s the one last bottle.

580
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,199
The late Governor left it for you

581
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,159
to save yourself

582
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,719
at the critical time.

583
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,639
Are you sure you want to

584
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,040
give it to Mr. Fang?

585
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,040
Mr. Fang is the savior

586
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,439
of our whole clan.

587
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
And Lord Qinghai helped us

588
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,800
recapture our homeland,

589
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,199
Lanzi City.

590
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,520
Mr. Fang is in danger now.

591
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,159
If we still hide our treasure

592
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,199
at such a critical moment,

593
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,479
do you think

594
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,399
God will still bless us?

595
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,199
But,

596
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,040
what if you

597
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,239
meet any danger in the future?

598
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
If I had to,

599
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,639
I would gladly

600
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,560
trade my own life

601
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,360
for Mr. Fang’s right now.

602
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,280
Salia has grown up!

603
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,399
Our leader has become an adult!

604
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:54,879
Lord Qinghai,

605
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,479
this is our clan’s panacea.

606
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,560
I have got it ready.

607
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:58,800
Mr. Fang

608
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,439
may wake up after having it.

609
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,120
However,

610
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,520
this panacea is strong.

611
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,399
After taking it, he needs someone

612
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,399
with strong martial arts to input
power for 12 hours,

613
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,800
otherwise, it would be harmful.

614
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,239
Thank you.

615
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,040
But,

616
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,040
Mr. Fang can’t swallow now.

617
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,560
What should we do?

618
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,719
I know how to do it.

619
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,159
Please don’t worry.

620
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,080
Please leave us alone.

621
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,800
Your Majesty, you look great!

622
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:14,879
Qiqi,

623
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,800
your embroidery skill

624
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,360
is getting better and better.

625
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,639
Thank you, Your Majesty.

626
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,560
Rise.

627
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,159
Anything to tell me?

628
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:52,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

629
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
I’m just worried.

630
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:56,560
Lord Qinghai hasn’t come back.

631
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,239
Is he…?

632
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,080
Don’t worry.

633
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,679
Fang Haishi got injured.

634
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,040
Lord Qinghai

635
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,639
is taking care of him

636
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,040
and will be back in days.

637
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,280
You have been working hard these days.

638
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,159
That’s nothing.

639
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,399
The intelligence network in Hanzhou

640
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,280
has been repaired.

641
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,639
I’m worried if there is anything wrong.

642
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,679
So I think

643
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,080
Lord Qinghai can check it out

644
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,199
after he comes back.

645
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,280
No hurry.

646
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,320
The spy who was escorted back

647
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,600
from Lanzi has been survived

648
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,360
after medical treatment.

649
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:28,679
The Grand Justice reported that

650
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,600
the interrogation can begin
in the next few days.

651
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
When the final result is available,

652
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:34,080
we will know what went wrong

653
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,520
with the intelligence network,

654
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,479
and then we will verify it.

655
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:39,520
The spy

656
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
survived?

657
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,360
He did.

658
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,760
But the interrogation is needed.

659
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,120
Remember to keep an eye on the

660
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,800
exchange of information in the future.

661
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

662
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,320
Shaozi,

663
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,719
what took you so long?

664
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,040
We’re starving.

665
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,679
I’m afraid of being discovered.

666
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
How is the one inside?

667
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:31,840
He is fine.

668
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:33,239
There are all kinds of tonics.

669
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:34,439
Any wound can be healed.

670
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,959
But we are suffering.

671
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
We have to guard here

672
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,399
on such a cold day.

673
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,000
Stop complaining.

674
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,719
The interrogation is about to begin.

675
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,120
You will

676
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,520
be free after it.

677
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,760
I’ll go have a check.

678
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,159
Zheliu,

679
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,120
what’s wrong with Madam?

680
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,679
Does she forget the time?

681
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,280
She has been sitting there for long.

682
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Here comes His Majesty’s edict.

683
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:53,800
It’s His Majesty’s oral edict.

684
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:56,239
Because the informal suit

685
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,479
for me this year is perfect,

686
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,639
I reward each one in the Fabric Office

687
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:04,360
with a bowl of almond tea.

688
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,159
Respect this.

689
00:44:07,919 --> 00:44:10,840
Thanks for Your Majesty’s grace.

690
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

691
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,280
Miss Ju, please have the tea.

692
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,080
Thank you.

693
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,159
Excuse me for leaving.

694
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,719
Madam,

695
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,080
let’s have the almond tea.

696
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,639
Or it will taste bad if it gets cold.

697
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,840
It’s from His Majesty.

698
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,560
Please have some.

699
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,840
Alright.

700
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,280
Zheliu.

701
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,600
Thanks.

702
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:14,520
What are you waiting for?

703
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,120
Anyone there?

704
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,159
Come and have the almond tea!

705
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
I’ll go have a check.

706
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,840
- It’s mine.
- Yours.

707
00:45:24,399 --> 00:45:25,560
Come on.

708
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:35,400
(Fabric Office)

709
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,360
Are you two the ones

710
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,600
who came a few days ago
to repair the official uniforms?

711
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,000
Miss Zheliu is really smart.

712
00:45:40,439 --> 00:45:41,639
Fabric Office is always busy.

713
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:42,959
I wonder if our uniforms

714
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,399
have been repaired.

715
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,679
I planned to send them to you tomorrow.

716
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,080
Since you’re already here,

717
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,040
please wait for a moment.

718
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
I will go fetch them.

719
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,879
I told you.

720
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,840
Zheliu is not only beautiful

721
00:45:58,959 --> 00:45:59,919
but also very nice.

722
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:01,000
Whoever can marry

723
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,879
such a girl

724
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,639
will be so lucky.

725
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,840
If we hadn’t had our uniforms mended,

726
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,719
we wouldn’t have had the chance

727
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,159
to come to the Fabric Office.

728
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,800
If Mr. Fang knew this,

729
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,360
we’d be punished

730
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,600
for leaving our posts.

731
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,120
I’d be happy to be punished.

732
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:23,840
Here are your uniforms.

733
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,320
Please come again

734
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:26,760
if there is anything wrong.

735
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,639
Thank you.

736
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,919
Sorry for disturbing you. See you.

737
00:47:30,439 --> 00:47:32,159
