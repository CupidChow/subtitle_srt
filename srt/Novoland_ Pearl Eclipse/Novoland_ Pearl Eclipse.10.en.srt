25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,360
Your Highness.

26
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,526
This is as far as I can take you.

27
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,060
Thank you.

28

(The South Palace)

29
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,550
Your Highness.

30
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,361
I’m a little scared.

31
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:27,076
This palace has been unoccupied
for a long time.

32
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,880
It’s like the ghostdom.

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,675
Yeah.

34
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,039
It’s scary.

35
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,630
It’s great that no one else is here.

36
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,984
The moonlight is bright and clear.

37
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,880
And it’s quiet here.

38
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,034
If we have peace of mind,

39
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:44,836
how is this place a ghostdom?

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
It is clearly the wonderland.

41
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:49,360
Here,

42
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,600
we don’t need to be worried all the time

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,639
like we were in Yu’an Palace.

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,479
We don’t need to see

45
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,360
the Emperor of Dazheng.

46
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:56,919
Isn’t it free?

47
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:58,240
Your Highness.

48
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,320
You are not planning

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,700
to stay here forever, right?

50
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,600
You were born

51
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,600
and raised in the palace.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
How can you

53
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,039
get along with such a rough life?

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,121
Although I grew up in the palace,

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,730
I wasn’t living

56
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,279
an extravagant life.

57
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:15,559
Let’s just

58
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,119
live a peaceful life here.

59
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,920
Don’t forget

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,359
our responsibilities.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,760
I only feel bad about Xiaoguai.

62
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,399
I don’t know

63
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,679
if the servants in Yu’an Palace

64
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,331
will take good care of it.

65
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,920
Your Highness, did you

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,359
deliberately offend
the Emperor of Dazheng

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
to let him

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,575
send us to the South Palace?

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,959
You are smart.

70
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,959
Figure out a way

71
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,839
to let him allow us
to go back to Yu’an Palace.

72
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,150
It’s autumn now.

73
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,175
Winter will come soon.

74
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,440
Zhongzhou is not like Leizhou.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
It’s really damp and cold here.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,239
You won’t be able to stand it.

77
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,000
Bihong.

78
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:47,959
Bihong.

79
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:51,224
My home is where my heart settles.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,280
People are born with a lot of tenacity.

81
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,804
We won’t know

82
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,920
how much we can endure

83
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,000
and stand until we are in

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,079
a desperate situation.

85
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,606
I think

86
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,839
we should live in this room.

87
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,100
It should be a sunlit room.

88
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,000
Your Highness.

89
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,480
Your Majesty.

90
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,799
I’ve sent

91
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,200
Consort Shurong to the South Palace
as you ordered.

92
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,640
Is the gate locked?

93
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,399
Yes.

94
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,079
It’s locked.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,359
And the guards

96
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,239
of the South Palace have been ordered

97
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,040
that no one is allowed to open the gate

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,279
without

99
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,440
Your Majesty’s approval.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,940
And no one is allowed

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,439
to come near the South Palace
for thirty feet.

102
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,480
But, Your Majesty.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
The South Palace is isolated

104
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,040
and it has fallen into disrepair.

105
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,600
Consort Shurong is weak in health...

106
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,275
She deserves it.

107
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:15,600
(Jifeng Pavilion)

108
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:18,726
My Lord.

109
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:20,184
My Lord.

110
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,320
We’ve packed all the stuff
in Jifeng Pavilion.

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,399
It’s just

112
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,640
Young Master Haishi

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
had been recovering from his wound.

114
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
I dare not disturb him.

115
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
So,

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,720
I didn’t tidy up his room.

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,600
I think

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,760
he is almost recovered now.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,581
Should I ask the servants

120
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,104
to tidy up his room?

121
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,600
No need.

122
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,320
My Lord, you are going to...

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
I have my plan.

124
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,810
Yes, My Lord.

125
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
Young Master Haishi?

126
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,014
I’ll leave.

127
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,720
Master, are you going

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,040
to leave me here alone?

129
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,399
You’ve grown up.

130
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,791
There are all men in Zhaoming Palace.

131
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,725
It will be inconvenient for you.

132
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,575
Master.

133
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,760
What’s inconvenient?

134
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,760
Haven’t we been

135
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
always like this?

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,359
Isn’t it good
that we stay together forever?

137
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,440
Master, Zhuoying

138
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,839
and I, the three of us.

139
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Childish.

140
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
You think I’m burdensome?

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,359
Don’t be ridiculous.

142
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,679
The work in Jifeng Pavilion

143
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,519
will come to an end one day,

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,160
and you are gonna

145
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,320
live as a woman one day.

146
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:53,959
Let’s not talk about it.

147
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,650
Go to do your things.

148
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,200
Madam.

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,559
You’ve been

150
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,300
embroidering for days without sleep.

151
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,950
Don’t wear yourself out.

152
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,359
Why don’t you take a break?

153
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,840
It’s almost done.

154
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,080
Liu.

155
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,159
Look.

156
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,679
Is there any flaw?

157
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,359
Look carefully.

158
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,840
After all, His Majesty and Lord Qinghai

159
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,925
have known each other for years.

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,039
They are close friends.

161
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,175
Nothing must go wrong

162
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,520
with this gift.

163
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,599
I see.

164
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,039
Madam, your craftsmanship

165
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,225
is ingenious

166
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:42,575
and excellent.

167
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,320
I will be contented

168
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,159
to have

169
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,719
one-tenth of your talent.

170
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,840
I’m basically a blind person now.

171
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:52,559
I’m just muddling along

172
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,080
in the name of blind embroidery.

173
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,320
How good can it be?

174
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:58,840
I’ll be satisfied

175
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,760
if there is no flaw.

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,751
Madam, I’ve checked it.

177
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,559
There is no flaw.

178
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:09,960
Liu.

179
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,280
Take the embroidery

180
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,359
and come with me
to present it to His Majesty.

181
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
You’ve been working for days.

182
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,080
I think His Majesty
is still in the court.

183
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,440
Why don’t you take a break first?

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,760
Liu.

185
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,760
Yes, Madam.

186
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,440
You are supposed
to move into Zhaoming Palace

187
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,850
the day before yesterday.

188
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Why haven’t I heard any news from you?

189
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:31,919
I’ve been thinking about it
for some time

190
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
and I still think it’s improper.

191
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,389
Besides, it will be really inconvenient.

192
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,159
I remember

193
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,039
I granted you a surname

194
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,320
many years ago, right?

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,039
You vowed not to take a wife
for your life

196
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,280
and you took my surname, Chu.

197
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,599
How is it improper
to live in Zhaoming Palace

198
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,525
where Shuyun once lived?

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,960
But Shuyun will leave the palace
and build his own mansion

200
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,119
after reaching adulthood.

201
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,320
That’s decided.

202
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,599
I make the rules.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Is it bad for you

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
to live in the palace?

205
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,640
Manager of Fabric Office, Ju Qiqi.

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,239
Greetings, Your Majesty.

207
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,575
You may rise.

208
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,800
Did you make new clothes

209
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,961
for me again?

210
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,400
I learned

211
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
that Lord Qinghai ascended
to the rank of nobility

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,640
and he can

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,159
assist Your Majesty in the court now.

214
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,599
I have all sorts of feelings

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,239
and I think

216
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,359
it’s worth celebrating.

217
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,039
So I hurried to make

218
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,840
this embroidery

219
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
specially for Your Majesty.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,599
Qiqi’s craftsmanship

221
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,200
is...

222
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,550
... is really good.

223
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,475
Seems that

224
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,119
I need to thank Jianming today

225
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,490
for letting me have such a good thing.

226
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,520
Your Majesty, you overpraised me.

227
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,479
Since I’ve made my thoughts known,

228
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,039
I won’t bother you anymore.

229
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,670
Kapok?

230
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,520
You mean the kapok is for me?

231
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,850
The Manager of Fabric Office said

232
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,075
it was for Your Majesty.

233
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,039
Nonsense.

234
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,475
It’s a big kapok.

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
How could it be for me?

236
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,385
If I remember correctly,

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,479
the marriage custom

238
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,039
in your hometown, Liushang,

239
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,200
is to put

240
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,960
the pillowcase

241
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,359
embroidered with kapok

242
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,479
into the bride’s dowry.

243
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,119
I remember

244
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,599
at your second brother’s wedding,

245
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,200
we went to the bridal chamber

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,280
and hid under the bed.

247
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,520
We put the seed shells

248
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,799
into the kapok pillowcase.

249
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,640
Who said

250
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,000
that kapok, according to
the customs of Liushang,

251
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,400
is a symbol of the bride’s determination

252
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,440
to go through ups and downs
with her husband

253
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,559
and walk into the sunset together

254
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,850
until death do them part?

255
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,599
Yeah?

256
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,280
I don’t remember.

257
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:17,679
I think

258
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,520
Qiqi is reminding me,

259
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,359
also reminding you.

260
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,080
This marriage has been settled.

261
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:30,679
Stop hesitating.

262
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,080
Qiqi is a poor girl.

263
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,159
She has been waiting for you
for so long.

264
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,325
If there is nothing else,

265
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,675
I’ll leave.

266
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,125
Get out.

267
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,750
Mu Deqing.

268
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:50,325
Yes.

269
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:51,865
Look how beautiful the flower is.

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes, it’s beautiful.

271
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,039
It’s really beautiful.

272
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,320
A man who never flinched

273
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,475
in a battle

274
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,479
actually becomes a deserter

275
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,550
in terms of his relationship.

276
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:17,719
Haishi!

277
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,159
Brother.

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,555
Haishi!

279
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:24,599
Brother.

280
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,075
You are back so soon.

281
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:26,700
Of course.

282
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,050
I changed horses every time
I arrived at a courier station

283
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,679
and wore out two horses.

284
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,479
Well done.

285
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:34,239
You took the third place
in the imperial examination.

286
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,750
When you meet His Majesty tomorrow,

287
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,440
he will appoint you
as a Palace Minister.

288
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:40,359
Then when you walk along the street,

289
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,280
with your good appearance,

290
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,440
there will be a lot of girls and ladies

291
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,599
throwing themselves at you.

292
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,599
I don’t have the luck to enjoy that.

293
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:49,440
Of course, you don’t have the luck

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,880
to be favored by beauties.

295
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,880
However,

296
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,719
you are very good,

297
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,679
but you are

298
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,559
almost as good as me.

299
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,719
Don’t mention it.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,975
I’m not competent enough,

301
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:05,479
and I got Master in trouble.

302
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,760
I won’t say you got him in trouble.

303
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,011
But Master should have

304
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,760
come out of the shadow long ago.

305
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:10,526
By the way,

306
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,880
how is your injury?

307
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,039
It’s fine.

308
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
That’s good.

309
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,559
I didn’t expect Su Ming

310
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,525
to be so despicable.

311
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,320
He plotted against Master

312
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,159
again and again.

313
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,000
He even set you up.

314
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,640
But after what happened this time,

315
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,799
I think he will lay low for some time.

316
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,440
If he tries to hurt anyone again,

317
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
I won’t let him get away with it.

318
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,215
This man

319
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,700
has just been demoted by His Majesty.

320
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,719
He is angry right now.

321
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,359
As long as he won’t hurt Master,

322
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,100
I can take this.

323
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:43,760
Haishi.

324
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,760
Come on.

325
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,039
See what good stuff

326
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,000
I brought you.

327
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:48,840
Your mother

328
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,679
brought you a lot of delicious food.

329
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,250
Ah?

330
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,125
These are my favorite snacks

331
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,320
when I was a kid.

332
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Um.

333
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,599
Your mother is so nice to you.

334
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,159
Look.

335
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,400
She made you so many delicious foods.

336
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,640
But to be honest,

337
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
I couldn’t help but eat some

338
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:05,964
on my way back.

339
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,119
How is she?

340
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,679
She couldn’t be better.

341
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,679
Since Master took you

342
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,760
back to Tianqi,

343
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,880
we’ve been investigating

344
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,550
the pearl tax corruption incident.

345
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,721
Later, His Majesty made another decree.

346
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,039
And it went on

347
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,799
really well.

348
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,880
Your mother was proud of you

349
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
when she learned
that you took the third place

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
in the Palace Examination.

351
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,200
Before I left,

352
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
she pulled me aside and said,

353
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,479
“Zhuoying,

354
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,440
tell Haishi

355
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,359
to be loyal to the government

356
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,479
and be filial to his master”.

357
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,280
She specifically

358
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
asked you to be friendly to me.

359
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:40,960
Haishi.

360
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,200
Take a look for me.

361
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:46,760
How is this pearl bracelet?

362
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
Just so you know,

363
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,440
this bracelet is not for you.

364
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,325
Hey.

365
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,925
Ah?

366
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,679
I want you

367
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,799
to check out this bracelet for me.

368
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,559
I think

369
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,875
that’s what girls like.

370
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,719
It’s good if you think it’s good.

371
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,079
Where’s Master?

372
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,560
I think he should be busy now.

373
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,599
Jifeng Pavilion is

374
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,640
almost packed up.

375
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:18,700
Why is your room

376
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,640
still the same?

377
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you not

378
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,079
moving into Zhaoming Palace with us?

379
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,199
I’m not leaving.

380
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,079
Master must have

381
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,079
his own plan.

382
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:33,760
It’s okay

383
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,675
if we don’t live together.

384
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,040
I will visit you

385
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
when I go on duty

386
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,760
in the Palace.

387
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,560
But,

388
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,520
you have to save some pomegranate cakes

389
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,560
for me next time.

390
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:43,920
No way.

391
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:45,025
I won’t be used to

392
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,160
the life without you.

393
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
Master won’t be used to it, either.

394
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,160
I will talk to...

395
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,959
Fang Zhuoying.

396
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,599
Don’t act on impulse.

397
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,880
Let’s just do

398
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,199
what Master said.

399
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,760
Let’s do

400
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,880
what Master said?

401
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,079
When have you been so obedient?

402
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,280
I’m indebted to Master.

403
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,920
I wouldn’t be who I am today

404
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
without him.

405
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,280
Besides,

406
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,439
I’ve made enough trouble

407
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,599
for Master.

408
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,280
It’s okay.

409
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
It will be

410
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,775
very free

411
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,175
to live in Jifeng Pavilion
all by myself.

412
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,599
Don’t go to Master,

413
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,811
or I won’t talk to you anymore.

414
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,119
Master.

415
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,239
You are back.

416
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:57,925
Yes.

417
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,686
I hurried to Yuezhou.

418
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,560
After I got in touch

419
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,325
with Grand Justice

420
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:02,500
and finished the handing-over procedure,

421
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,640
I hurried back to Tianqi immediately.

422
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:04,850
Um.

423
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,839
Master.

424
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,239
I want to ask

425
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:09,959
if we are moving from Jifeng Pavilion

426
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,680
into Zhaoming Palace tomorrow.

427
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:12,959
Yes.

428
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,199
What about Haishi?

429
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,000
Will Haishi come with us?

430
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:18,160
That’s not the plan.

431
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,040
You didn’t plan

432
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,280
or you didn’t want to plan?

433
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,079
Master.

434
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,700
You said that Haishi was good.

435
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,825
The pearl tax corruption is eliminated.

436
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:31,625
Haishi is not

437
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,560
unreasonable or unprofessional.

438
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,839
After this is over,

439
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,950
if Haishi still has a rebellious heart,

440
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,439
he still won’t do

441
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,359
anything silly

442
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,300
for your sake.

443
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,640
There are all men in Zhaoming Palace.

444
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,950
It will be inconvenient for you.

445
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,325
What’s inconvenient?

446
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:49,239
Haven’t we been

447
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,160
always like this?

448
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
Isn’t it good
that we stay together forever?

449
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,560
Master, Zhuoying

450
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,239
and I, the three of us.

451
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,400
Master.

452
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,400
Haishi will be sad.

453
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,500
You don’t even know

454
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,160
there are some things
he will never say to you.

455
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,640
Zheliu.

456
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,359
Why are you still embroidering?

457
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,079
It’s dark now.

458
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,119
Are you not going to rest?

459
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,079
You go back first.

460
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,959
It’s perfect to practice
blind embroidery in the dark.

461
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,000
All right.

462
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,199
I’ll go back then.

463
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,319
There is no one here.

464
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,839
You should also rest earlier.

465
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,539
Um.

Where is Jianming?

481
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,681
Why isn’t he here yet?

482
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,439
Your Majesty.

483
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,800
You just asked about it.

484
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,119
Lord Qinghai went to
Left General’s Mansion.

485
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,199
He can’t leave.

486
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,479
I forgot it.

487
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,625
All right.

488
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,400
Your Majesty.

489
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,199
Should I get a music band here

490
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:52,760
for you?

491
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,100
I just heard it a few days ago.

492
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,680
The lute player

493
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
misplayed a few notes on purpose

494
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,560
to get me to correct him.

495
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
They thought I couldn’t distinguish it.

496
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,250
Xiaobai. Xiaobai.

497
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,625
How did you get out again?

498
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,640
Don’t you like

499
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,920
staying at the Fabric Office?

500
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,839
If you run away next time,

501
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,880
I’ll only feed you hay tomorrow
as your punishment.

502
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,880
Zheliu from the Fabric Office
greets Your Majesty.

503
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,079
The Fabric Office?

504
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

505
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:34,839
Why are you holding

506
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,959
the rabbit of Yu’an Palace?

507
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,560
Your Majesty.

508
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,560
This is my rabbit.

509
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,525
Its name is Xiaobai.

510
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:42,920
Don’t answer what you’re not asked.

511
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

512
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:47,064
Leave us.

513
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

514
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,319
I’ll leave.

515
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:03,850
Oh, right,

516
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,085
did Lyu Rongzhi

517
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,359
present a memorial

518
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,599
about repairing the willow dam?

519
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,071
Yes, Your Majesty.

520
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,359
But it was

521
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,200
a dozen days ago.

522
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,275
Oh.

523
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,040
I remember he had some hard feelings.

524
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:22,160
He said the two dykes were breached

525
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,900
because I didn’t cultivate myself.

526
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:25,425
And if I don’t change myself,

527
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:26,760
disasters will come.

528
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:29,775
There’s something interesting
about this guy.

529
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,600
Summon him.

530
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,125
I’d like to see

531
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,850
what he would say in front of me.

532
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,411
After the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

534
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:40,974
His Majesty ascended to the throne

535
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,641
and reformed the three battalions
to deploy defense,

536
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,880
which are Huangquan Battalion,

537
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,885
Chengcheng Battalion
and Wuwei Battalion.

538
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,606
The garrison is relieved
every five years.

539
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,110
But now the border is short of hands.

540
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,760
The three battalions

541
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,650
each recruited 30,000 new soldiers.

542
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,055
The Left Guard was weakened.

543
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,929
I was worried before.

544
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:00,100
But now we have Lord Qinghai.

545
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,861
We don’t need to worry about it.

546
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,839
Back in the day,
Lord Qinghai and His Majesty

547
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,199
led the Beifu Army to put the riot down

548
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,439
and destroyed the enemy.

549
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,011
Everyone across the country
heard about it.

550
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:09,439
At that time,

551
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,125
Lord Qinghai was only 17 years old.

552
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Now Lord Qinghai has come.

553
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,479
The defense of Tianqi

554
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,560
is as solid as a mountain.

555
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,239
Yeah.

556
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,350
Lord Qinghai.

557
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah.

558
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,040
After Lord Qinghai came,

559
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
there’s no need to worry about

560
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,250
the defense of Tianqi.

561
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:30,284
But it’s time to rotate the army now.

562
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,650
If we conscript people now,

563
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:32,816
and in the autumn,

564
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,675
I’m afraid it will affect
farming and harvesting.

565
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,850
Let’s get down to business.

566
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:40,085
Yes.

567
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,520
I thought

568
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,160
he would have some true insights.

569
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:45,800
It turns out he just wants

570
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,599
to earn a good reputation for himself.

571
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,531
What’s the difference
between the officials

572
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,230
and the music band?

573
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,215
They can only see

574
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,056
profit and loss on it.

575
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,070
They

576
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,255
did what they could

577
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,041
and it all backfired in the end.

578
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,629
Where is this place?

579
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:19,255
Why is it so desolate?

580
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:21,000
Your Majesty.

581
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,816
The South Palace is ahead.

582
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,150
The South Palace?

583
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,090
Yes.

584
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:28,335
We’ve already walked here.

585
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,889
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

586
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,525
Is your mouth sealed?

587
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,245
Mu Deqing.

588
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,136
Mu Deqing.

589
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,821
Yes.

590
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,599
I want Consort Shurong
to introspect in the South Palace.

591
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:08,425
But you

592
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,560
turned this place

593
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,280
into a quiet and livable retreat.

594
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,216
I dare not.

595
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:16,839
I’m afraid Consort Shurong

596
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,975
did it by herself...

597
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,304
Well...

598
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,775
She knows how to please herself.

599
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,386
This instrument is old

600
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,200
but good.

601
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,550
I didn’t know

602
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,775
we could find something like this

603
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,000
in those boxes at the door.

604
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,319
It’s worth all the time

605
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,479
we’ve been rummaging around.

606
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,019
This instrument

607
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:41,079
is rare to see.

608
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,586
Even in the palace,

609
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,935
not many people can play it well.

610
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,984
I didn’t know Your Majesty would come.

611
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,640
I’m disheveled

612
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,839
and it’s a breach of etiquette.

613
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:52,566
Please allow me to dress myself.

614
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,184
It’s not your first time

615
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,989
to be disrespectful in front of me.

616
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,550
Isn’t it too late

617
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,470
to think of etiquette now?

618
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:07,405
I sent you to the South Palace

619
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,710
to think about your mistakes,

620
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,350
not to enjoy yourself.

621
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,036
Is it the idol on the pendant?

622
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,839
Yes, Your Majesty.

623
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:33,359
The Dragon Tail

624
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,560
protects Zhunian.

625
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:38,356
Few people outside of Leizhou
believe it.

626
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,316
I carved it

627
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,115
to get good luck.

628
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,930
Hope Dragon Tail

629
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,959
can protect our safety.

630
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,359
Protect our safety?

631
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,380
You are in the deep palace.

632
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,815
I will protect your safety.

633
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,381
Whose safety did you carve this

634
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:00,636
to protect?

635
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,125
Is it Tang Qianzi
of Huangquan Battalion

636
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:13,084
or Fang Haishi of Jifeng Pavilion?

637
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
Not for anyone else.

638
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,250
Just for myself.

639
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,325
Yourself?

640
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,145
My birth mother
came from a humble background.

641
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,199
She often taught me

642
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,925
to see myself clearly.

643
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,150
I don’t

644
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:28,880
have the ability

645
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,125
to protect others.

646
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,925
It’s just for myself.

647
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,110
Zhongxu.

648
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,119
You are more skillful

649
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,525
at archery now.

650
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,189
Thank you, Father.

651
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:47,875
Um.

652
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,085
Father.

653
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,636
Zhongxu is skilled in archery.

654
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:53,040
I’d like to invite Zhongxu

655
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,640
to draw the bow for me next year.

656
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,439
You want Zhongxu
to draw the bow for you?

657
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,599
Yes, please allow me.

658
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:00,354
Good.

659
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:01,599
Zhongxu

660
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,160
will assist you anyway.

661
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:04,680
All right.

662
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,125
I have memorials to read.

663
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,160
You keep practicing.

664
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,960
- Good day, Father.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

665
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,560
Shouldn’t a servant

666
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,959
draw the bow during the hunting?

667
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:21,775
Stop saying it.

668
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,160
Mother told us before we left

669
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,641
not to make any trouble.

670
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,920
Our country is governed by benevolence.

671
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,199
We don’t need brutes.

672
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,920
How would he understand that?

673
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,440
He is a baseborn son.

674
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,376
Exactly.

675
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:34,959
His mother was born of humble origins.

676
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,878
She can’t raise a good son.

677
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,039
I’m also a baseborn son.

678
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,695
When my mother was alive,

679
00:32:43,225 --> 00:32:44,625
she always taught me

680
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,250
to be patient all the time.

681
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,525
But later I learned

682
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,775
that I didn’t have to

683
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,825
put up with everything.

684
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,959
Your Majesty.

685
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,690
Zizan is not like you at all.

686
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,160
She was always trying

687
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:08,104
to protect the people around her.

688
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Zizan

689
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:14,800
once

690
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,375
carved Baixi

691
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,439
to pray for the safety of soldiers

692
00:33:19,575 --> 00:33:21,136
who were about to go to war.

693
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:25,855
Well, then, just do what she did

694
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,479
and carve a Dragon Tail

695
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,640
for each of the 30,000 recruits

696
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,541
from the three battalions.

697
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,200
Your Majesty, mercy.

698
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,680
Consort Shurong
only has one pair of hands.

699
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,560
How can she carve

700
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,680
30,000 amulets?

701
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,521
Mercy, Your Majesty.

702
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,525
Yes, Your Majesty.

703
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,315
Your Highness!

704
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,615
Mu Deqing.

705
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:51,235
Yes.

706
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:52,875
Send the material used for carving

707
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,276
to Consort Shurong.

708
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:55,725
Let the treasury

709
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,695
send her whatever she needs.

710
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,041
Yes.

711
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,070
If you have someone in your heart,

712
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,945
you won’t just

713
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,571
pray for your own safety.

714
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,385
You will smile when she smiles

715
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,125
and cry when she cries.

716
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:15,399
You know

717
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,800
you’ll be apart one day,

718
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,249
so you pray

719
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,096
to live longer.

720
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,551
But when she leaves,

721
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,865
you will hate yourself

722
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,950
for living too long.

723
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:44,575
On that day, you said

724
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,720
you could imitate Zizan
as long as I could be happy.

725
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,259
Let me tell you,

726
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,770
Zizan has gone.

727
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,125
I

728
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,294
will never be happy again.

729
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,600
Bring me Dizi 3,

730
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,640
Volume 103.

731
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,570
Yes.

732
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,381
Are you hungry?

733
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,770
Yes.

734
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,484
After I’m done with this,

735
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,430
we can have dinner.

736
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:29,795
Yes.

737
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,509
My Lord.

738
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,015
It’s about 8:00 PM now.

739
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:45,005
It’s this late already.

740
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,444
You should go to rest.

741
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:51,576
No way.

742
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:53,715
You are still studying the file.

743
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,611
How can we leave first?

744
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:00,975
All right.

745
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,399
Put the file away.

746
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,580
Let’s go together.

747
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,680
Yes.

748
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Young Master Haishi.

749
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:39,840
This is the dress you will wear

750
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,919
when you visit His Majesty tomorrow.

751
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,000
(Ruyi Shop)
Take a look.

752
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,761
(Ruyi Shop)
Fresh vegetables.

753
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,108
(Ruyi Shop)
Take a look.

754
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,500
Sir.

755
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,875
Do you want to buy jade wares?

756
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:18,840
The jade wares in Ruyi Shop

757
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
are the best in Tianqi.

758
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:21,879
They are made with fine jade

759
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:23,025
from Wanzhou

760
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,634
with exquisite workmanship.

761
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,950
Wrap this one for me.

762
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,830
Okay.

763
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:31,575
Xiaowu.

764
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:32,075
Yes.

765
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,840
Wrap it up and put it

766
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,225
into a brocade box.

767
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:36,600
What else do you want?

768
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,239
Just let me know.

769
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,679
If there’s nothing you like
on the shelf,

770
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
we also have a lot of stock

771
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
in our warehouse.

772
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,120
Wrap

773
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,159
this one for me, too.

774
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,679
You have such good taste.

775
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,000
This is

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,080
the only piece of white jade

777
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
across Tianqi.

778
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,025
Xiaowu.

779
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:52,550
Yes.

780
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,679
Wrap this one

781
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,840
in a brocade box, too.

782
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,325
Okay.

783
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:55,875
Here.

784
00:37:58,475 --> 00:37:59,315
Here you are.

785
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:03,919
Look.

786
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,879
What?

787
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:05,679
What good stuff

788
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,300
makes you so...?

789
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,310
What a handsome young man!

790
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,760
You don’t know it.

791
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
He is Fang Haishi,

792
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,959
the apprentice of Lord Qinghai.

793
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,719
He took the imperial examination

794
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,959
with my elder brother.

795
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,650
Ah?

796
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,919
Is he Young Master Haishi

797
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,725
whose talent and bravery
are well known in Tianqi?

798
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,719
His article was chosen by the Emperor

799
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,919
and he took the first place
in the Palace Examination?

800
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:22,925
Yeah.

801
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,439
If he wasn’t set up
in the Palace Examination,

802
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,520
such a handsome man would have

803
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,000
come out on top.

804
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:29,239
What a good-looking and graceful man!

805
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,300
Come on, everybody!

806
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,520
- Young Master Haishi is here!
- You are

807
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,159
the famous Young Master Haishi.

808
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,520
You have an imposing disposition indeed.

809
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,425
Sorry about the poor treat.

810
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:36,450
Young Master Haishi.

811
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,639
My little daughter is still unmarried.

812
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,325
- What’s your horoscope?
- Young Master Haishi.

813
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,520
Young Master Haishi.

814
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,520
Young Master Haishi.

815
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,000
- Don’t touch my jade wares.
- Young Master Haishi!

816
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,750
Don’t go, Young Master Haishi!

817
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,199
- Young Master Haishi!
- Young Master Haishi!

818
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,080
Young Master Haishi!

819
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,600
Do you still want the jade pendant?

820
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,425
Young Master Haishi!

821
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,900
(Tailor Shop)

822
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,975
(Tailor Shop)

823
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:24,675
Ah.

824
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:25,760
Youdu, here you are.

825
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,879
He looks good

826
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,200
in our clothes.

827
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,360
It’s a pity.

828
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,679
What for?

829
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,280
It’s rare to see

830
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,520
such a free and bright girl.

831
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,040
It is rare.

832
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,080
It’s a guy, isn’t it?

833
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,840
A guy?

834
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:42,900
Yeah.

835
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,360
He

836
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,400
walked into our shop

837
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,679
and picked a woman’s dress.

838
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,399
He put it on and left.

839
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,825
Isn’t it scary?

840
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:53,385
You are

841
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,925
totally senseless.

842
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,239
Youdu.

843
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,159
What brings you here?

844
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,155
The guards inside and outside the hall

845
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:01,100
have been changed.

846
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,100
I’ve also placed people
in the waiting area.

847
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,599
Zhuoying.

848
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,871
Take Haishi into the hall later.

849
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,310
Yes.

850
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:13,724
My Lord.

851
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,800
I made a mistake.

852
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,239
When I informed
Young Master Haishi yesterday,

853
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,320
I told him the wrong time.

854
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,025
He hasn’t

855
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,375
come back yet.

856
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:22,485
Did he say where he was going?

857
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,280
He said he would be back

858
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,399
after buying a few things on the street.

859
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,719
I’ll send people to look for him now.

860
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,959
Master, let me find him.

861
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:27,679
Bring Haishi

862
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,239
outside the hall at 9:15 AM.

863
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,289
Yes.

864
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,500
Haishi.

865
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,871
You found me.

866
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,325
You were so right about it.

867
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:42,875
Come on.

868
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,560
I almost got skinned alive just now.

869
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,800
You came just right. Cover for me.

870
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,721
I’ll go back to the pavilion.

871
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:47,639
It’s too late.

872
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,600
They need you to wait
in front of the hall

873
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,520
before 9:15 AM

874
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,439
- to meet His Majesty.
- Come on. You guys.

875
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,475
They told you the wrong time.

876
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,225
- They told me the wrong time?
- Lift it up.

877
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,150
Okay.

878
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,281
I...

879
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:06,725
(Zichen Hall)

880
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:11,235
My Lord.

881
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,199
There is still no news.

882
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,475
It’s already 9:00 AM.

883
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,995
His Majesty will summon him soon.

884
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,980
What to do?

885
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,379
It’s okay.

886
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,335
I’ll explain to His Majesty.

887
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:30,665
Zhuo Yifan greets Your Majesty.

888
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,760
Where is Fang Haishi

889
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
who came in third?

890
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,394
Your Majesty.

891
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:43,000
Fang Haishi was poisoned before.

892
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,679
He was nearly cured,

893
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,540
but it got serious again this morning.

894
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,701
He can’t come to visit you.

895
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,681
Make the announcement.

896
00:41:54,275 --> 00:41:54,914
Yes.

897
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,389
By the decree of His Majesty,

898
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,640
Zhuo Yifan and Fang Haishi

899
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,040
are made Palace Ministers
in the Beifu Army,

900
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,560
receiving a salary
according to their positions

901
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,399
and waiting for tasks to be assigned.

902
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,159
Respect this.

903
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,679
The Palace Examination is over now.

904
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,189
And it’s up to you

905
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,000
as to how to use

906
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,580
Zhuo Yifan and Fang Haishi.

907
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

908
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Speaking of Fang Haishi,

909
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:28,159
he really learned something from you.

910
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,300
It’s such an important day,

911
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,580
and he didn’t show up.

912
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,840
He...

913
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,600
Don’t tell me he got sick again.

914
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,000
I think he is alive and kicking.

915
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,750
Maybe he is having fun somewhere.

916
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,879
My goodness!

917
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,520
You were just a little late.

918
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,475
But you didn’t even show up.

919
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,025
That’s presumptuous.

920
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,990
I’ve been unlucky recently.

921
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,600
I got everything

922
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,919
perfectly

923
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,239
scheduled

924
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,479
before I left.

925
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:55,360
I thought

926
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,679
the people at Jifeng Pavilion

927
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,919
are prudent and cautious.

928
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,000
But they told me

929
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,080
the wrong time to meet His Majesty.

930
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Now

931
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:02,975
I messed it up.

932
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,560
It’s my fault either way.

933
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,800
What are you waiting for?

934
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,150
Just go back now.

935
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,881
Master

936
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:15,550
must be awake right now.

937
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,560
Do you want to see

938
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,919
that face?

939
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,959
I know you

940
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,760
too well.

941
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,719
- Look.
- Master...

942
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:23,450
Although

943
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,150
you look reckless,

944
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:26,596
you are a warmhearted person.

945
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:28,280
Master is totally different.

946
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:29,520
Master

947
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,500
has a pair of eyes

948
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,150
like obsidian.

949
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,159
It’s bright.

950
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:34,760
Even you hold it

951
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,800
against yourself,

952
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,159
you may not necessarily warm it up.

953
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:37,959
I always

954
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:39,719
want to get close to Master.

955
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,600
In the end,

956
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,040
I can only watch him from a distance

957
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
and respect him.

958
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,280
Now

959
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,720
I made such trouble.

960
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I’m afraid Master

961
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,199
will alienate me again.

962
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,000
I...

963
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,650
By the way,

964
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,629
I know

965
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,080
you were scolded

966
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,360
when you tried to persuade Master

967
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,600
for me.

968
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,034
Don’t mention

969
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,399
taking me to Zhaoming Palace again.

970
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:58,399
Do you hear me?

971
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,715
Who was scolded?

972
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,120
Master.

973
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:10,199
I’m going to face the wall now.

974
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,320
You swaggered through the street

975
00:44:11,925 --> 00:44:13,284
dressed like this.

976
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,879
How inappropriate!

977
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,000
Today you were supposed
to meet His Majesty,

978
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:20,586
but you didn’t show up.

979
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,099
It was disrespectful.

980
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,479
Although it’s not just

981
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:24,250
your fault,

982
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,479
you are still largely to blame.

983
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:26,199
Master.

984
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:27,600
You shouldn’t blame Haishi.

985
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,250
Go away.

986
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,420
I...

987
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,050
Master, it’s my fault.

988
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:34,540
I should be more prudent.

989
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,260
I shouldn’t
go out on the street like this.

990
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,155
I’ll face the wall now.

991
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,919
Go back and pack your stuff.

992
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,575
Pack my stuff?

993
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:51,956
Master, you want me to come with you?

994
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,679
It’s not appropriate

995
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,080
to leave you alone in Jifeng Pavilion.

996
00:44:55,975 --> 00:44:57,376
Move to the Zhaoming Palace.

997
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,725
I...

998
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,391
Haishi.

999
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,100
Ah?

1000
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,120
What are you waiting for?

1001
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,025
Thank Master now.

1002
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,025
Um.

1003
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,159
Thank you, Master.

1004
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:15,439
I think the rain won’t stop

1005
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:16,650
for a while.

1006
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,500
Um.

1007
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:19,400
Here.

1008
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,925
You...

1009
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,199
It’s for you.

1010
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,400
It’s a jade pendant.

1011
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,425
For me?

1012
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:28,975
Um.

1013
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:31,875
Now you accomplished fame

1014
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,195
and got me a gift.

1015
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,239
You are different.

1016
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,360
You are more generous now.

1017
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,080
You don’t want it?

1018
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,000
Give it back to me.

1019
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:38,906
I want it.

1020
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,350
It’s a gift from you.

1021
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,320
Of course, I’ll take it.

1022
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:46,600
How’s it?

1023
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:55,719
Do you feel constrained

1024
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,479
with me being here?

1025
00:45:57,975 --> 00:45:58,525
- Ah?
- Ah?

1026
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,505
Not at all.

1027
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,540
Master.

1028
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,779
How come?

1029
00:46:03,925 --> 00:46:06,046
We feel at ease with you here.

1030
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:09,535
We need to think about rules
when you are around.

1031
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,455
I do feel restrictive.

1032
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,800
But I think

1033
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,725
that’s what we should do.

1034
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:15,000
We should always keep in mind

1035
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,775
what you taught us.

1036
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:43,334
Haishi.

1037
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,125
Um.

1038
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,210
What about your gift for Master?

1039
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,171
I didn’t buy one.

1040
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:53,360
I think

1041
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,320
the things on the street are too rough

1042
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,040
for Master to use.

1043
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,840
So you didn’t buy anything?

1044
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,199
How can you think in that way?

1045
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,360
Master always

1046
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,159
cleans up your mess for you

1047
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,360
when you make mistakes.

1048
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,199
Well,

1049
00:47:04,525 --> 00:47:05,239
today

1050
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,439
I’ll just give

1051
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:08,159
this jade pendant you bought

1052
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:08,760
to Master.

1053
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,560
Next time,

1054
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,575
you can give Master

1055
00:47:10,575 --> 00:47:11,560
a bigger and better gift

1056
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,320
for his birthday.

1057
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,080
No need.

1058
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,239
The rain has stopped.

1059
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:14,950
Let’s go.

1060
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:21,280
I...

1061
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:26,944
After we move out,

1062
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,679
we won’t be able to live together

1063
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,575
for some time.

1064
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:30,120
Um.

1065
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,959
But fortunately,

1066
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:32,120
it won’t be long

1067
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,250
before you, me,

1068
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:35,100
and Master

1069
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,860
can live together again.

1070
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,600
There are a lot of things we can do

1071
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,239
after we move into the palace.

1072
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:41,150
Haishi.

1073
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:41,750
- Um.
- Come over.

1074
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,679
Of course!

1075
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:46,239
Fang Zhuoying!

1076
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:47,775
Hey.

1077
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:48,719

1078
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:50,200
