Young Master Haishi,

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,880
Mr. Fang and Young Master Zhuoying

27
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,000
are fine now.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,399
Please have a rest.

29
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,140
Please take care of my family.

30
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,725
My pleasure.

31
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,439
This is my job.

32
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,679
Young Master Haishi looks

33
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,520
weird today.

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,141
Don’t talk too much. Do your job.

35
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:56,850
Master,

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,241
if I don’t kill the fatuous emperor
before I leave,

37
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,119
he will hurt you sooner or later.

38
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,880
Your Majesty,

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,839
since last winter,

40
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,191
the frontier has been tight.

41
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,279
And this spring, Huangquan Battalion,
Chengcheng Battalion

42
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,000
and Wuwei Battalion

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,241
have increased by a total of
30,000 soldiers

44
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,350
during the scheduled change of defense,

45
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,759
making the burden
of military service and corvée

46
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,279
even heavier than in previous years.

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,399
There are many criticisms in the court.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

49
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,839
In particular, the 30,000 recruits

50
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,679
sent to the three battalions
were supposed to

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,519
enrich the Left Guard

52
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,150
and the 200,000 Beifu Army.

53
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,200
In this way,

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,160
the military strength of the capital
was reduced.

55
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,480
Once there is any trouble

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,640
in Tianqi City,

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
the imperial capital

58
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,750
will inevitably be in danger.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
The capital is important,

60
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,519
but the frontier must also be defended.

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,559
A mere 30,000 recruits

62
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,119
really stretched
the Armament Department.

63
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes. Right.

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,839
That’s the point.

65
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,600
Exactly.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,050
(West Corner Gate)

67
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:00,279
Stop there!

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Who are you?

69
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,000
You’re from Jifeng Pavilion.

70
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,839
Please.

71
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,775
Commander,

72
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:41,970
why are you sitting up?

73
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:51,200
Where is Zhuoying?

74
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,920
How is he now?

75
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,920
His fever has gone down.

76
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,480
The physician said he could get up

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,959
after a few more days of recuperation.

78
00:05:59,225 --> 00:05:59,800
Hmm.

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,119
Where is Haishi?

80
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,500
Young Master Haishi

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,839
left Jifeng Pavilion alone

82
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,675
after your and

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,839
Young Master Zhuoying’s conditions

84
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,760
were stabilized.

85
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:10,920
No.

86
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,480
Haishi went to the Palace.

87
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:13,839
Your Majesty,

88
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,700
the Rebellion of Prince Yi
remains fresh in our memory.

89
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,800
It was the inadequate guarding
of the Imperial City

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,959
that allowed Prince Yi
to take advantage of it.

91
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,040
Mr. Zhao is right.

93
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,519
We must be careful.

94
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,880
I hope Your Majesty will think twice

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,350
about redeploying these recruits

96
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,875
to avoid chaos again, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,040
I see.

98
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,119
You may leave.

99
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,399
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

100
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,359
I told you to leave!

101
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,586
Your Majesty,

102
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,870
please excuse us.

103
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,109
Your Majesty, don’t be angry.

104
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,119
Your Highness.

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Your Highness.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,350
Do you really want to present

107
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,559
these lotus cakes to the emperor?

108
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,500
I’m afraid it’s not the right time now.

109
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,785
Open it.

110
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,839
Your Majesty.

111
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,851
This pastry

112
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,399
looks much better than the one

113
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,279
we had on our wedding day.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
Have a try, then.

115
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,760
I don’t know if it

116
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
tastes good.

117
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,925
You like to be fed?

118
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:53,485
This is a bad habit.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Bad?

120
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,600
Why?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Too lazy.

122
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,390
Only fat pigs need to be fed.

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,519
I find that your cooking skills

124
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,519
have not improved much,

125
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,279
but your eloquence is getting better.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,259
Your Highness!

127
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,060
Who asked you to do so?

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,799
Who told you to spy on me?

129
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,279
Who taught you to walk around

130
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,600
the Palace with these pastries?

131
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,279
Didn’t I tell you?

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
Without my order,

133
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
don’t leave Yu’an Palace a step!

134
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,020
I just want to get my pendant back.

135
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,080
Only this Dragon Tail Pendant.

136
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,679
It is the badge

137
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,960
of the Clan of Corolti.

138
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,599
I’ve been wearing it since my childhood.

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,080
So, I’m still wearing it today.

140
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Didn’t anyone tell you?

141
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,200
The thing I hate the most is sweets!

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,039
What I hate the most is…

143
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,840
Your Majesty!

144
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,919
Please spare Her Highness!

145
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,799
This is our idea.

146
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,840
Your Majesty!

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,159
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

148
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,280
Your Majesty,

149
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,400
please forgive Her Highness this time

150
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,640
for the sake of the friendship

151
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,359
between Zhunian and Dazheng!

152
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,039
I’m willing to be punished
on her behalf!

153
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,455
So boring.

154
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,275
Your Highness.

155
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,599
Your Highness, are you alright?

156
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,850
Your Highness.

157
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,239
Stop there!

158
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,440
Who are you?

159
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,679
I have never seen you before.

160
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Will you tell me yourself

161
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,479
or we catch you and investigate?

162
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:49,335
I’m a new guard from Jifeng Pavilion.

163
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,200
I’m here to deliver a secret message
to His Majesty.

164
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:52,500
(Ji)

165
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:54,919
Sir, excuse me.

166
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,239
It’s fine.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Is Jingcheng Hall

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,280
from here onwards?

169
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,559
It is Yu’an Palace ahead.

170
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,919
Two corridors to the west

171
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
of the Palace

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,239
is Jingcheng Hall.

173
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,400
Thanks.

174
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,500
(Dinghe Gate)

175
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,159
Commander.

176
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,775
Where is His Majesty?

177
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,880
Commander,

178
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,479
His Majesty just headed
to Jingcheng Hall.

179
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,000
Your Highness.

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,880
Why bother to do so?

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
You didn’t get Dragon Tail Pendant

182
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
and you almost lost your life.

183
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,280
Consort Shurong?

184
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:47,280
This is Mr. Fang

185
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
who saved us at the valley.

186
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,320
Greetings, Consort Shurong.

187
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,239
Mr. Fang.

188
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,039
You are…

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
Mr. Fang,

190
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,675
it’s not a safe place to talk here.

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,175
Yu’an Palace is ahead.

192
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Let’s talk inside.

193
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:05,880
Who had the audacity

194
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,159
to let that woman near the study?

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,880
Please calm down.

196
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,500
Get lost!

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,359
Mu Deqing!

198
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

199
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,000
Who put

200
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,475
this thing here?

201
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,559
This…

202
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,875
It must be

203
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,039
the servant who cleaned

204
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,239
the Palace this morning…

205
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:40,479
Throw it away!

206
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,799
As far away as possible!

207
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,000
If I see this thing again,

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,880
you will lose your eyes

209
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,825
and head!

210
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:46,520
Spare me, Your Majesty!

211
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
Spare me, Your Majesty!

212
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,719
I…

213
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,119
I will throw it away now!

214
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,840
I’ll do it now…

215
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,156
Your Majesty.

216
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,919
After being beaten with a cane

217
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,359
and kneeling all night,

218
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,074
you’re still alive?

219
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,455
I can still hold out.

220
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,000
You come just in time.

221
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
Mu Deqing!

222
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,775
Yes, Your Majesty.

223
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,239
Keep that thing

225
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,799
here.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Huh?

227
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,080
That’s too much!

228
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,239
This man is so tyrannical and unethical.

229
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,640
He should have died

230
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
during the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

231
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,039
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

232
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,520
Bihong is outside.

233
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,599
If someone is coming,

234
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,840
she will alert us.

235
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,880
Mr. Fang, you should also be careful.

236
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,080
I know you’re

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,025
caring about Her Highness.

238
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,200
But this is a treacherous statement.

239
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,280
After all, we are in the Palace.

240
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,775
We should be careful of spies.

241
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,640
Yes, Mr. Fang.

242
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,200
The tongue cuts the throat.

243
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,400
Your Highness, how do you feel now?

244
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,799
Now

245
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,760
I am fine.

246
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,719
Don’t worry about me.

247
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,640
How can I be not worried?

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,919
That man is…

249
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,559
I thank you on behalf of Her Highness

250
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,239
for your kindness.

251
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,119
Her Highness is new here

252
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,159
and has no relatives.

253
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,880
If there is any difficulty
in the future,

254
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,599
I hope you will give
a helping hand to Her Highness

255
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,080
like how you did before.

256
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,239
Bizi,

257
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,520
don’t make it hard on Mr. Fang.

258
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,320
By the way, I think you should

259
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,200
change the ways you call me.

260
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,080
Don’t call me Consort Shurong now

261
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,825
and Your Highness then.

262
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,760
It will be another trouble

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,799
if anyone hears it.

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Yes.

265
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,679
Since Your Highness is fine,

266
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,039
I feel relieved.

267
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,000
I have something else to do.

268
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,150
I’m leaving.

269
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,799
I’m afraid I won’t have many

270
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,320
chances to meet you.

271
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,919
Please take care.

272
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,200
I will come to see you again

273
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,239
if there is a chance.

274
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,840
See Mr. Fang off.

275
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,700
Alert! Someone is coming!

276
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,159
Here comes His Majesty’s order!

277
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Hurry up!

278
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,559
Mr. Fang,

279
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,719
please come with me.

280
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,960
Consort Shurong,

281
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,561
here’s His Majesty’s order.
Please take it.

282
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,679
Here’s His Majesty’s word.

283
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,775
Consort Shurong,
go to the court immediately.

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

285
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,919
Please.

286
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,200
Your Majesty,

287
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,041
Consort Shurong is here.

288
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:32,119
Greetings, Your Majesty.

289
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,599
Rise.

290
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,045
Yes, Your Majesty.

291
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,091
Come forward.

292
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,171
Stand there.

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Have a look.

294
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,359
How does the real person
compare to the portrait?

295
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,679
How about

296
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,025
I give her to you?

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,650
Your Majesty!

298
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,039
Your Majesty, please don’t.

299
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,475
Why not?

300
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,280
Her Highness is the Princess of Zhunian.

301
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,000
So what?

302
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,080
I have a blood oath

303
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,750
that I’ll never get married in my life.

304
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
Come out!

305
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,760
Here is His Majesty.

306
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,400
Protect His Majesty!

307
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,119
Greet His Majesty.

308
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,439
Protect His Majesty!

309
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:28,625
Hurry up!

310
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,959
Protect His Majesty!

311
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,280
Leave here.

312
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
I said leave here!

313
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:38,625
Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,160
Greet His Majesty!

315
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,275
Mr. Fang…

316
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,239
You know each other?

317
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,350
It looks like I made

318
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,439
a wrong match.

319
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,400
Fang Haishi,

320
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,079
I met you before.

321
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,851
The story of your heroic rescue

322
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,920
in the midst of thousands of enemies

323
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,319
has already spread to the Xiping Port

324
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,479
and Tianqi City.

325
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,359
At such a young age,

326
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,839
you are so heroic.

327
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,000
No wonder my Consort Shurong

328
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,319
admires you a lot.

329
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,000
I think maybe it’s more than admiration.

330
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,160
Maybe you have already

331
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,199
pledged to marry each other.

332
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,599
That’s slander!

333
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,520
Consort Shurong is innocent.

334
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
How can you presume ill on her!

335
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,319
Don’t be rude!

336
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,280
You even dare to defend her
in front of me.

337
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:50,495
Great.

338
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,079
Then I will give you a hand

339
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,040
to get you and Consort Shurong together.

340
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,839
Maybe it will

341
00:18:59,119 --> 00:18:59,959
become

342
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,079
a beautiful love story.

343
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:03,599
Princess Tilan

344
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,000
came a long way here

345
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,599
from Zhunian.

346
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,479
What has she done wrong?

347
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,239
How can you humiliate her like this?

348
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,199
And my master and senior

349
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,599
got punished by you for no reason.

350
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,751
They always worked hard for you.

351
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:17,925
What did they do wrong?

352
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:18,646
Shut up.

353
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,760
I

354
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,839
am the Lord of this kingdom.

355
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,000
I just need to follow my heart.

356
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,640
You have lost your benevolence
and your morality.

357
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,350
Anyone is qualified to kill you.

358
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,626
You want to kill me?

359
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,050
For your master? Your senior?

360
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:38,664
Or,

361
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,950
for a woman?

362
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:42,880
I never dare to

363
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,280
covet Her Highness,

364
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,079
because she deserves

365
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,119
a better man.

366
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,959
But, you’re right.

367
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,835
I’m here to kill you.

368
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,599
Interesting.

369
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,839
You said what they dare not to say.

370
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,900
Fang Zhu,

371
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,475
let him go.

372
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,599
I’d like to see

373
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,275
how capable he is.

374
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
Keep on fighting.

375
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,476
The winner will marry her.

376
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,199
Mr. Fang, don’t do this.

377
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,280
It’s unworthy.

378
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,000
His Majesty hates me so much.

379
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:58,255
I have made my decision.

380
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,400
Princess Tilan!

381
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,269
- Princess Tilan!
- Consort Shurong!

382
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,160
Since I have come to Dazheng,

383
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,439
I can’t go back to Zhunian.

384
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,000
With the Dragon Tail as the witness,

385
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,420
this has nothing to do with Mr. Fang.

386
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,839
I know Your Majesty dislikes me.

387
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,719
I can only choose death.

388
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,319
You’re done here.

389
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,760
How hypocritical!

390
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,599
Get out.

391
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,925
See Consort Shurong off!

392
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,839
Fang Haishi,

393
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,439
you want to kill me?

394
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,239
I

395
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,560
want to be killed by you, too.

396
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:19,594
But your master is between us.

397
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,439
He won’t let us get what we want.

398
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,725
How about you kill him first?

399
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,920
You’re not that capable.

400
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,119
Just stay

401
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,800
by his side and learn harder.

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I’m waiting for you.

403
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,811
But, be quick.

404
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,479
There are

405
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,760
hundreds of people

406
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,385
who want to kill me now.

407
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,436
But they are all incapable.

408
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,079
I

409
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,479
am tired of living long ago.

410
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,160
Mu Deqing!

411
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

412
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,439
I called Fang Zhu and his apprentice

413
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,284
to present their martial arts today.

414
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,345
I had fun.

415
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:09,335
Reward Fang Zhu with
a horse and armor,

416
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,880
and give

417
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:13,314
Fang Haishi a spear.

418
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,159
Why do you follow me back?

420
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,314
Master, you’re still injured.

421
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,599
You have been expelled
from Jifeng Pavilion.

422
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,839
I’m no longer your master.

423
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,575
Why?

424
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,680
You dared to assassinate His Majesty.

425
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,825
Don’t you know why?

426
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:44,325
Emperor Xu has been making things

427
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:45,650
difficult for you for so many years.

428
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,359
Princess Tilan has been tortured

429
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,280
in the Palace.

430
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,199
And he

431
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,599
almost killed you and Zhuoying.

432
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,560
He deserves to die.

433
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,175
How dare you!

434
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,199
For so many years,

435
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:56,199
you have been sparing no effort

436
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,199
to work for him,

437
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,119
wearing a mask

438
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,520
and standing in the shadow of him.

439
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,839
This should not have been your choice.

440
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,599
Master,

441
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,250
if you really care for Princess Tilan,

442
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:06,850
you should…

443
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,450
Enough!

444
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,520
I don’t know Princess Tilan at all.

445
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
And I don’t treat His Majesty

446
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,560
the way you think I do.

447
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,719
You are stubborn by nature.

448
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,640
I have known for a long time that

449
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,040
you may not be submissive
to His Majesty.

450
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,520
That’s why I didn’t

451
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,239
let you perform any task.

452
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:27,525
But I never thought you would

453
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,040
dare to assassinate His Majesty

454
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,155
after following me for so many years.

455
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,119
Leave.

456
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,760
Otherwise,

457
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,821
I will kill you sooner or later.

458
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,199
I thought you never let me

459
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,079
perform any task because you

460
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,599
worried about my safety.

461
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,560
What relationship is it

462
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,079
between you and Emperor Xu?

463
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,880
What have you done to him?

464
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
He is my best friend.

465
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:56,025
He is more important than my life.

466
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,109
I took an oath to be faithful to him.

467
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
Master, what about me?

468
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,920
I also swore

469
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,800
to be faithful to you.

470
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,560
I, Fang Haishi, have never been

471
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,119
a person who is afraid to face the end.

472
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,110
I won’t leave.

473
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,439
Master, if you want to kill me,

474
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,225
please make the decision now.

475
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,640
Your Majesty,

476
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:26,700
please have the ginger soup.

477
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
You chose the incense?

478
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,880
Yes.

479
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,465
The one before is out of store.

480
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,599
I asked someone

481
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,040
to pick this from the treasury.

482
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:48,150
The same incense as the one before

483
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,400
hasn’t been made yet.

484
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,160
I’ll change it

485
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,800
right after it’s ready.

486
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,280
Don’t bother.

487
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,479
Nothing in the world

488
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,239
is exactly the same.

489
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,750
Don’t bother insisting on it.

490
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,479
Just use this one.

491
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:05,575
Yes.

492
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,160
Announce a decree.

493
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:13,450
Hmm?

494
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,700
I want to announce a decree.

495
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

496
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,520
I’m on my way.

497
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,250
He’s been on his knees
since he got back?

498
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,079
Yes.

499
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:19,520
No one stopped him?

500
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,920
Young Master Zhuoying
is still sick in bed.

501
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,650
No one else dared to stop him.

502
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,719
I’ve never seen Commander

503
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:28,239
lose his temper so much.

504
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,800
Let’s go.

505
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:45,920
Commander.

506
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,880
Mr. Fang,

507
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,900
here’s His Majesty’s order.

508
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,359
Please take it.

509
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,199
Here comes His Majesty’s order!

510
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,839
The young and promising Fang Haishi

511
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,959
of Jifeng Pavilion

512
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,000
should participate in this year’s
imperial examinations

513
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,800
as a military examination candidate

514
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,680
to serve the country.

515
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,800
Respect this.

516
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,220
Thanks, Your Majesty.

517
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:27,359
Here.

518
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,119
Mr. Fang,

519
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,454
be careful.

520
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,719
Mr. Fang,

521
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:32,280
His Majesty loves talents

522
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,880
and seems to cherish

523
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,040
Fang Haishi.

524
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:38,529
Yes.

525
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,850
Excuse me for leaving.

526
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,775
(Fang Haishi of Jifeng Pavilion should
participate in an imperial examination)

527
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,675
(as a military examination candidate
to serve the country.)

528
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:45,675
Master.

529
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,421
You forgive me?

530
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,175
His Majesty gives you the chance.

531
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,300
If you can’t finish this job
in ten days,

532
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,650
don’t come back.

533
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,119
Madam.

534
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,400
Liu’s embroidery skill

535
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,330
is getting better and better.

536
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,035
It owes to your guidance.

537
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:01,505
Liu,

538
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,901
you have mastered the skill.

539
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,910
Stop embroidering those
miscellaneous things.

540
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,261
You should go to embroider

541
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,250
the new Bowmen Commandant’s robe.

542
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,925
New Bowmen Commandant’s robe?

543
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,520
Yes.

544
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,270
He is a disciple of my friend.

545
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,319
He previously served as Palace Minister,

546
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,319
and then took over the task
to go to the frontier.

547
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,704
He was in a hurry

548
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:22,599
and wore

549
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,075
his old official robe to the post.

550
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,920
I know you have to deal with

551
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,479
the new clothes of Consort Shurong.

552
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,075
But the new official robe
also needs to be made quickly.

553
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,280
Yes.

554
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,920
Is this new Bowmen Commandant

555
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,479
the Mr. Fang

556
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,425
who was nearly killed by

557
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,800
His Majesty’s punishment

558
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,640
on the day of Lord Chang’s return?

559
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
Any news

560
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
spreads quickly in this palace.

561
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
Although Zhuoying was reprimanded
by His Majesty,

562
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,040
he was not demoted after all.

563
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,959
The new robe still needs to be made.

564
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,839
Yes.

565
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,679
I’ll start preparing for it.

566
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,080
By the way,

567
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,959
Madam,

568
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:13,120
how does Mr. Fang look like?

569
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,861
He was born with a pair of
single-edged eyelids,

570
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:18,386
a straight and high nose, deep contour,

571
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,479
a heroic face

572
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,479
with a firm gaze.

573
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,159
There is an extraordinary

574
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,760
pride in him

575
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,719
and he even

576
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,439
makes a wind when he walks.

577
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,024
From your description,

578
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,959
this Mr. Fang seems to have

579
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,239
the appearance

580
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,150
of a northern Hanzhou man.

581
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,600
If you want to know the specific size,

582
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,479
there are records in the booklet.

583
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:40,199
Yes.

584
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,421
I got it.

585
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,879
I will finish the embroidery carefully.

586
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,720
Single-edged eyelids.

587
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,540
Straight and high nose.

588
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,836
Deep contour.

589
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
Firm gaze.

590
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,199
Fang Zhuoying.

591
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,855
Alright, Young Master Zhuoying.

592
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,320
Your physique is really

593
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
different from normal people.

594
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,800
In just a few days,

595
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,239
most of your injuries have recovered.

596
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,050
I’ll give you a few more medicine

597
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,080
to open your veins

598
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,239
and improve your healing.

599
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,159
Please take them on time.

600
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,399
It will speed up your recovery.

601
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:27,520
Physician,

602
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,399
when can I

603
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,520
go back to the drill ground?

604
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
It’s so boring drinking the bitter

605
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,439
medicine here every day.

606
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:33,879
I feel like my bones are getting crispy.

607
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,919
- Please don’t…
- No hurry to go to the drill ground.

608
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:37,439
Master.

609
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,900
Get well first.

610
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,000
It’s not easy for you to get out

611
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
of bed and walk around.

612
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Commander.

613
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,199
Master,

614
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:46,760
where is Haishi?

615
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,490
He is on a mission.

616
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,719
On a mission?

617
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,919
What…

618
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:57,239
Master, it’s great.

619
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,320
Haishi has always been wanting

620
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,159
to help you.

621
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,000
Thank you

622
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,439
for Zhuoying’s healing.

623
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:07,286
The cane wounds are secondary

624
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,399
to the knife wounds.

625
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,500
Don’t leave any

626
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,840
lingering effect.

627
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,879
This is the silvery ginseng
given by His Majesty.

628
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:16,080
You can use it.

629
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,840
If the ingredients and herbs
are not enough,

630
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,360
just ask them to buy more.

631
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Yes.

632
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,639
I’m leaving now.

633
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,240
Sure.

634
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,730
Master,

635
00:36:30,525 --> 00:36:31,439
I’ve been staying

636
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,879
here for the past few days.

637
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:33,840
Is it hard

638
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,100
to explain to His Majesty?

639
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,335
You know his temper.

640
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:37,719
It’ll be fine later.

641
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Just have enough rest.

642
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:40,114
Master,

643
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,101
what mission is Haishi on?

644
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,350
Don’t you remember our rules?

645
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,360
I dare not.

646
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,000
Since you’re here,

647
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:47,855
get down and have a drink with me.

648
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,325
Uncle Zhao?

649
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,590
Young Master Haishi,

650
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,850
I didn’t expect you to come.

651
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,181
Didn’t you resign and retire?

652
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:16,750
Why are you here?

653
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,114
Young Master Haishi,

654
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,900
since we’re destined to meet again,

655
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:24,275
why not have a drink together?

656
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,639
This time I was ordered

657
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:29,959
to come for…

658
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,919
Young Master Haishi,

659
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:35,439
just do it then.

660
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,719
You know everything,

661
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,520
then why…

662
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,239
Why didn’t I escape?

663
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,360
You and I both know

664
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,679
the rule of Jifeng Pavilion.

665
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,199
I did my best

666
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,760
but didn’t get away.

667
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,580
It’s such a big world,

668
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,959
but there is no place for me anymore.

669
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:55,995
If there is any misunderstanding,

670
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:58,665
we can go back to explain it.

671
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:02,080
Young Master Haishi,

672
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,625
when we picked up Princess of Zhunian
in Jubei Town,

673
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,959
Young Master Zhuoying had divided
the troops into three ways

674
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,320
to make every plan,

675
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,760
but the information was
still leaked out.

676
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,159
That’s because

677
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,479
I colluded with spies of Nihualuo.

678
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,159
I grew up in Jifeng Pavilion.

679
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,575
I know exactly what kind of man

680
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:24,879
you are.

681
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,399
But now…

682
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,270
If you have a reason,

683
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,909
there are other ways.

684
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,705
Why bother to do so?

685
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,719
It’s not important whether

686
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:36,875
I have a reason.

687
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,450
I have made a big mistake.

688
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,679
You have a pure mind.

689
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,875
Don’t judge people from
their appearances.

690
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,040
I knew this would happen

691
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,375
when Commander

692
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,360
allowed me to resign

693
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,760
from Jifeng Pavilion.

694
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,199
Fortunately, it’s you

695
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,800
who will give me the last help.

696
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,825
Thanks.

697
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:01,604
Uncle Zhao!

698
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:34,750
(Jifeng Pavilion)

699
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,475
Young Master Zhuoying!

700
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,800
Young Master Zhuoying!
Young Master Zhuoying!

701
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
The physician said that

702
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,639
you can’t do strenuous activities yet.

703
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,275
Why not?

704
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,080
I’m getting stiff

705
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,120
if I keep lying in bed.

706
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,719
Young Master Zhuoying, are you alright?

707
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,879
Haishi is not here.

708
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,600
I feel so lonely here.

709
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,439
Commander.

710
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,280
Master.

711
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,760
It’s time for Young Master Zhuoying
to change dressings.

712
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,780
Don’t make it hard on others.

713
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,661
Yes, Master.

714
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,840
I’m going back for recovery now.

715
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:16,725
Master.

716
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:28,399
Master.

717
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,881
The mission is completed.

718
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,279
Today is the 10th day.

719
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:37,895
Good.

720
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,479
Master,

721
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,441
I have one question.

722
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,959
Before we started the action,

723
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,719
Uncle Zhao didn’t participate

724
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,039
in our decision-making,

725
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,719
that is, he knew which carriage

726
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,639
Princess Tilan was in after

727
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,959
we set off.

728
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,600
When we were in the carriage,

729
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,120
I had an eye on

730
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,040
his every move.

731
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:02,719
He said he betrayed us

732
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,280
and gave information to the spy.

733
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,679
No matter how I counted,

734
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,549
he didn’t have the time.

735
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,600
If you’re still

736
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,670
asking for the truth,

737
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:15,336
don’t stay in Jifeng Pavilion.

738
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,600
Master.

739
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:18,096
Go back to your room.

740
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:24,855
Master, thank you for keeping me stay.

741
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,040
Don’t thank me.

742
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,070
If it weren’t for His Majesty’s decree,

743
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:29,520
you wouldn’t have a chance

744
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,679
to stay here.

745
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,810
Master, do you know that

746
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,919
every word you say today

747
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,399
will

748
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:44,755
hurt me a lot?

749
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,555
You’re too soft-hearted.

750
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:49,919
It’s not a good thing to be

751
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,959
too soft-hearted in Jifeng Pavilion.

752
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,700
Master,

753
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,959
you saved my life.

754
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,280
As I said,

755
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,239
I will definitely repay you.

756
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,550
As long as

757
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,719
you ask me to do something,

758
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,205
I will definitely do it

759
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,279
no matter what it is and how to do it.

760
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,239
On the contrary,

761
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:20,159
if anyone wants to hurt you,

762
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,460
I won’t let him go.

763
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,639
But this time,

764
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,100
I don’t know what I did wrong.

765
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,870
If I had to kill myself

766
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,430
for His Majesty to live today,

767
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,760
I wouldn’t hesitate

768
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,925
to do so.

769
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,919
You stay in Jifeng Pavilion

770
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:41,719
voluntarily today.

771
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,840
I didn’t detain you.

772
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,679
Since you’re here now,

773
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,239
remember,

774
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,439
don’t you ever hurt His Majesty again.

775
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,679
And remember,

776
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,199
to finish missions,

777
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:53,184
you will

778
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,810
suffer a lot in the future,

779
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,159
but what I suffered

780
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:00,825
is much more than you.

781
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,360
Jifeng Flower is really beautiful.

782
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,520
Master,

783
00:45:16,725 --> 00:45:18,245
who do you plant Jifeng Trees here?

784
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,431
“My depression is like the blossom
which is as white as snow.”

785
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,210
“How many people can see through
everything clearly?”

786
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,159
Master,

787
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,879
what does that mean?

00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:03,650
