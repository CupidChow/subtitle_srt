for this simple wedding in haste.

I gave you that candle.

Yes.

31
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:59,105
This feels like a dream.

32
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,815
I never

33
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,000
wanted more than to be

by your side,

35
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,679
let alone marry you.

36
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,865
I wouldn’t even dream of it.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
I was afraid it’d only end up shattered.

38
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,666
You wouldn’t be.

(Jincheng Palace)

Lord Qinghai.

80
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:53,350
Where’s His Majesty?

81
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,790
He went to Yu’an Palace an hour ago.

82
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,279
Your Majesty,

83
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
are you alright?

84
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,750
The soup...

85
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,040
is scalding.

86
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,160
It is

87
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,600
after being reheated just now.

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,239
You can have it later.

89
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,500
I can’t leave

90
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,825
without tasting your soup.

91
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,480
What to do?

92
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,844
Let me cool it off.

93
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,310
It’s much better now.

94
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:13,925
Poison...

95
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:15,679
Your Majesty...

96
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:16,955
Move!

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Your Highness!

98
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,239
Jianming!

99
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,414
How is he?

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,320
Please give me a minute, Your Majesty.

101
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,679
What?

102
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,080
Your Majesty,

103
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,559
Lord Qinghai is poisoned with

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,799
the Dawn Flower native to Zhunian.

105
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,679
There’s...

106
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,760
There’s no antidote to this poison.

107
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,190
What did you say?

108
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,290
As far as I know,

109
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,509
this poison

110
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
can’t be removed.

111
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:19,125
Lord Qinghai has built

112
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,679
stronger resistance

113
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,640
to poison

114
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,575
due to his medical history

115
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,860
and he’s had pills

116
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,000
to slow down the infection,

117
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,250
which

118
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,119
enabled him to hold longer

119
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,425
than most people.

120
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,400
Jianming!

121
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,275
Jianming!

122
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,789
I’ve tried all kinds of poison

123
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,429
except for this one.

124
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,935
Physician Li is right.

125
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,000
There’s no antidote to it.

126
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,200
No, Jianming!

127
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:54,916
Whatever it takes,

128
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,039
I...

129
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,286
I can’t...

130
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,399
I won’t

131
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,250
allow you to die.

132
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,625
Mu Deqing!

133
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,880
Summon the censor.

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,919
I’m issuing an edict.

135
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,200
Mu Deqing!

136
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,479
Get in here

137
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,760
or I’ll rip your head off!

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,440
Your Majesty.

139
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,320
No edict.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,440
No one else should know

141
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,760
I’m poisoned.

142
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,919
If it gets out,

143
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
it might shake the court.

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
And please

145
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,950
don’t blame Consort Shurong

146
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,559
just because

147
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,799
it happened in her palace.

148
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,990
There’s more to this incident.

149
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Physician Li,

150
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,110
how long do I have?

151
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,950
It depends on

152
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:53,425
how soon the poison infects the veins.

153
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,525
Normally,

154
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,719
the patient would die in three days.

155
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,520
But you’re

156
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,280
a martial artist.

157
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,599
Your energy could battle the poison

158
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,100
and...

159
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,400
probably buy you a month.

160
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,960
Thanks.

161
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,840
Jianming,

162
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,500
is it worth it?

163
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,080
I told you it was all for nothing!

164
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,150
Is this meaningless regime

165
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
worth all your sacrifices, Jianming?

166
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,320
I’d do anything

167
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,200
to protect you, Your Majesty.

168
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:59,000
You chased Zhuoying
for thousands of miles,

169
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,900
disappointed and resentful at me.

170
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,675
You wandered in Chishan City,

171
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,600
alone and weak.

172
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,840
Then you galloped hundreds of miles

173
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,250
back to the capital,

174
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,239
tireless and sleepless.

175
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,675
I thought I finally had a chance

176
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,359
to make

177
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,440
the rest of your life easy,

178
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,799
but in the end,

179
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,719
I could only fail you.

180
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,875
Why did you poison me?

181
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,320
No, Your Majesty,

182
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,434
I didn’t.

183
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,080
Someone threatened me

184
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,175
with my brother Suolan’s life.

185
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,001
My original plan

186
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,719
was to ignore his request

187
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,594
to force him out.

188
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,799
Then I’d find out about his identity

189
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,880
before taking any action.

190
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,200
That way, both my brother

191
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,679
and you would be safe.

192
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,875
- But...
- But I almost got killed.

193
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,820
I’m sorry

194
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,050
and I’ll take the consequences.

195
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:32,880
Your Majesty,

196
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,320
I did it,

197
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,080
not Consort Shurong or Bizi.

198
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,520
I’m so sorry, Your Highness,

199
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,919
but...

200
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,799
but Prince Suolan

201
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,960
once saved me.

202
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,524
I couldn’t risk his life.

203
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,334
Your Majesty,

204
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,220
I’ll take full responsibility.

205
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,195
Please don’t punish Consort Shurong.

206
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,760
Bihong.

207
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:12,595
Bihong!

208
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,200
Bihong!

209
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,159
Bihong!

210
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,599
Bihong!

211
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,119
Bihong!

212
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,660
Your Majesty, she’s dead.

213
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,000
Take her out.

214
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

215
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,479
Your Majesty,

216
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,150
Consort Shurong seems unwell.

217
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,000
Should I call in the physician

218
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:22,719
to examine her?

219
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,071
Go.

220
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,560
Fang Haishi

221
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,160
rushed back to
Zhaoming Palace overnight?

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,625
Yes.

223
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,359
She headed straight

224
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,680
to the Palace

225
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,319
after entering the city.

226
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,319
Why was she

227
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,439
in such a rush?

228
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,239
Never mind.

229
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,439
Send her an invitation.

230
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,850
Your Highness, why are you...?

231
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,319
Now that

232
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
she’s returned,

233
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,599
tomorrow,

234
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:03,754
during my birthday celebration,

235
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,199
I’ll ask His Majesty

236
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,560
to give her to me.

237
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,651
Once she’s under my roof,

238
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,586
her life

239
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,661
will be in my hands.

240
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,339
You’re foresighted, Your Highness.

241
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,959
Once Fang Haishi

242
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,199
is under our control,

243
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,199
we can prove her disguise as a man.

244
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:28,525
With that and
Fang Zhuoying’s assassination,

245
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,520
His Majesty

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,599
can no longer

247
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,479
cover for Fang Jianming

248
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,880
if you contact some officials

249
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,319
to fan the flame.

250
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,375
Hey,

251
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,839
have all our crack troops

252
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,079
stake out the Palace.

253
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,160
Once Fang Haishi is out,

254
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,839
watch her closely.

255
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,599
I’ll make a clean sweep

256
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,319
tomorrow.

257
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,319
Yes.

258
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,325
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

259
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,479
Consort Shurong is pregnant.

260
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Come again?

261
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Your Majesty,

262
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,880
Consort Shurong is pregnant.

263
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,719
What happened here tonight

264
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,350
stays in this room.

265
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,300
Any leak and your whole clan dies.

266
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,875
Consort Shurong is confined

267
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,575
to her palace, effective immediately.

268
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,880
No one here

269
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
shall get out

270
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,439
without my permission.

271
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:16,439
Zizan,

272
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,150
I’m losing Jianming, too.

273
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,575
Zizan, what should I do?

274
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,680
I hope I can still

275
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,920
protect Tilan.

276
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,560
Your Majesty.

277
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,950
All done?

278
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:53,525
Yes, Your Majesty.

279
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:55,520
Imperial Guards and servants

280
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,160
at Yu’an and Jincheng Palace

281
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
have all been vetted.

282
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,439
Not a single word

283
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,640
will be leaked out.

284
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,280
Guards on the night shift
at Yu’an Palace

285
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,880
have been reassigned

286
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,250
to step up security and look for leads.

287
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,560
Also, I’ve had physicians

288
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,640
look after Consort Shurong.

289
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,675
But Physician Li...

290
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:22,520
He can’t go.

291
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:26,575
He needs to

292
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,100
concentrate on

293
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,959
removing Jianming’s poison.

294
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,719
No one shall distract him.

295
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:33,245
Understood.

296
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,125
And Lord Chang’s birthday tomorrow?

297
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,075
Stick to the plan

298
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,655
to not raise any suspicion.

299
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,046
Lord.

300
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,280
Lord.

301
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,900
Lord Chang’s invitation

302
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,199
(Invitation)
arrived early this morning.

303
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,079
(Invitation)
It’s to invite Young Master Haishi

304
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,400
(Invitation)
to his birthday celebration today.

305
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,680
Bold move.

306
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,199
The last-minute invitation

307
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,719
is fishy enough, isn’t it?

308
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,319
According to our source,

309
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:05,839
Lord Chang is going to ask His Majesty

310
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
to transfer Young Master Haishi
to his mansion.

311
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:09,839
And he referred to Young Master Haishi

312
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,899
as “her”.

313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,560
Lord Chang is treacherous.

314
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,725
Why not

315
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:17,839
report him to His Majesty?

316
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,439
There are still spies

317
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,439
under deep cover

318
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,280
around His Majesty.

319
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,350
I see.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,125
Lord Chang took the hit for His Majesty

321
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,319
regardless of his intention.

322
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,475
His Majesty

323
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,359
sees him as his only brother

324
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,316
and owes him for saving his life.

325
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,359
Right now, we don’t have

326
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,439
a suspect of poisoning

327
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,119
or hard evidence.

328
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,520
Bringing charges against him

329
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,800
would only spook him.

330
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,479
We can get ahead of him

331
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,040
by helping
Young Master Haishi sneak out.

332
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,100
It’s too late.

333
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,920
Lord Chang is already onto Haishi.

334
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,599
No way

335
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,675
would he

336
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:51,719
let Haishi go now.

337
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,000
You...

338
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,520
Lord.

339
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,239
Go ahead.

340
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,239
Watch Lord Chang’s men closely

341
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,280
in case they move up their plot.

342
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,250
We can’t give Haishi to Lord Chang,

343
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,280
or her life will be at risk.

344
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,239
Yes.

345
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
From now on,

346
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,750
treat her as your younger brother.

347
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,800
I hope you can

348
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,280
watch each other’s back.

349
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,319
- Yes, Master!
- Yes, Master!

350
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,280
Haishi.

351
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,359
Young Master.

352
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:52,560
Don’t be so formal

353
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,599
as if we’re strangers.

354
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,239
I’ve always wanted a younger brother.

355
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:57,450
And now, I have you.

356
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,250
From now on,

357
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,610
we’re family.

358
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,079
It’s freezing.

359
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,599
Keep yourself warm.

360
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,880
Zhuoying’s room is the same

361
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:13,880
as if he didn’t leave.

362
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,900
Are you still mad at me
for letting him go?

363
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,525
I am.

364
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
You can’t blame me.

365
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:33,655
He’s my only brother after all.

366
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:35,959
Now that

367
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:38,880
he’s gone to where he belongs,

368
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,074
I don’t think he’ll come back again,

369
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,581
especially

370
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,736
he’s now a prince of Huku.

371
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,280
With his return,

372
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,040
he does have a chance to end

373
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,000
long-standing disputes
between our two states.

374
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:54,950
That’s what he’s striving for anyway.

375
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I’ve applied to His Majesty

376
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,560
for leaving the army

377
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:05,319
so that I can stay here permanently.

378
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:07,326
Are you sure?

379
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
Back there on the battlefield,

380
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,760
my flashing blade

381
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,839
in the snow

382
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,400
and the speed of my arrow

383
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,280
got the adrenalin flowing.

384
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,439
I kind of enjoyed that.

385
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,719
But Huangquan Pass

386
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,920
is too far away.

387
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,119
Dangers at home

388
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:32,719
and abroad

389
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
can’t scare me at all

390
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,680
as long as

391
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,325
we’re together.

392
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:48,920
By the way,

393
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,439
I made your favorite

394
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,825
sliced fish congee this morning.

395
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,500
Go get dressed

396
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:56,375
for breakfast.

397
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,875
Sure.

398
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,000
Aren’t you cold

399
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,239
in thin layers?

400
00:30:23,675 --> 00:30:24,719
No,

401
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,239
because I have you.

402
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,004
The fish was bought yesterday

403
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
and kept alive in the water.

404
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,560
It was still alive

405
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,760
and kicking this morning.

406
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,880
Still, my cooking

407
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:46,794
isn’t as good as yours.

408
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,450
Taste it.

409
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,800
Is it good?

410
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:03,825
Yes.

411
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,631
Yesterday,

412
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,576
I was exhausted

413
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,575
and dozed off.

414
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,450
I’ll stay awake tonight.

415
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,150
I’ll

416
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,575
treat you

417
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,750
as well as you treat me.

418
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,439
His Majesty is going to
Dongyu Horse Ranch

419
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,879
to watch Lord Chang fly eagles.

420
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:56,050
Would you like to join me?

421
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,469
Of course!

422
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,119
Let me

423
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,751
change back to my robe.

424
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,075
Finish your congee first.

425
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,560
Your Highness,

426
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,000
it’s snowing and chilly.

427
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,280
Don’t be too upset.

428
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,274
It’s bad for your baby.

429
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,439
I asked

430
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,700
Eunuch Mu in private.

431
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,750
He had buried Bihong properly.

432
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,200
What about His Majesty?

433
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,280
Is he alright?

434
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,199
He should be or he wouldn’t be going to

435
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,875
Dongyu Horse Ranch.

436
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:18,754
Dragon Tail,

437
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,040
please bless my baby

438
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,221
and my husband.

439
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,630
May Bihong’s soul

440
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,125
rest in peace.

441
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,325
This robe is tailor-made

442
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,599
for me.

443
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:01,895
After today,

444
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,199
you can stop wearing men’s robes.

445
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,275
Right.

446
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,850
This is the last time

447
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,250
I dress as a man.

448
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,040
Are you taking me

449
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,679
to get His Majesty’s blessing

450
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,875
so that I, Ye Haishi,

451
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,400
can be

452
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,100
Fang Jianming’s wife in public?

453
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:30,975
We’ll have children

454
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,425
and grow old together.

455
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,274
None of the Fang Family Leaders

456
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,539
of Liushang ended well.

457
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,120
If I can’t

458
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,681
grow old with you,

459
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,959
will you regret this?

460
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:51,679
No.

461
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,439
Not now.

462
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,051
Not ever.

463
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,399
I’ll be by your side

464
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,199
for as long as I can

465
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,571
to the end.

466
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,759
You’re my husband.

467
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,800
Keep this with you.

468
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:20,625
I will.

469
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,250
Let’s go.

470
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,453
(Zheng)

471
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,900
Today is Jichang’s birthday.

472
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,239
He once said to me

473
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,100
our state was founded on horseback.

474
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,431
He’d never forget that.

475
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,520
Today, he’s presenting

476
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,639
eagles he trained

477
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,639
to honor Dazheng.

478
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,439
May Dazheng thrive

479
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,199
forever and ever!

480
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:06,040
- May Dazheng thrive
- May Dazheng thrive

481
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,600
- forever and ever!
- forever and ever!

482
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,500
Big brother,

483
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,386
by convention,

484
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,331
I’ve prepared 24 eagles

485
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,950
befitting 24 solar terms.

486
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,711
There’s a white-feathered
and green-backed hawk

487
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:20,714
symbolizing heaven and earth.

488
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,500
It’s yours to shoot

489
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,840
once they are

490
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,159
all in the air

491
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:27,945
to bless Dazheng with good fortune.

492
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:37,825
Fly them!

493
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:58,446
His Majesty shot the white-feathered
and green-backed hawk!

494
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,350
Dazheng is blessed with good fortune!

495
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,110
Big brother,

496
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,450
right on target!

497
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,400
Thanks.

498
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:25,520
Watch out!

499
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:40,050
Master...

500
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,150
What...?

501
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,679
- He...
- That...

502
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,425
Mr. Fang Haishi...

503
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:50,300
is a woman!

504
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,919
- Mr. Fang is a woman!
- She’s a woman!

505
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:52,800
She’s a woman!

506
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:54,000
A woman!

507
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,175
- Mr. Fang is...
- Unbelievable!

508
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,080
Is it true?

509
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,479
Mr. Fang is a woman!

510
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,560
No way!

511
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,750
Yes! What’s happening?

512
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,600
I can’t believe this!

513
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:37,650
Jianming,

514
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,840
you’ve never missed

515
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,900
a single target

516
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,399
since you had this thumb ring.

517
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,250
Can I have it?

518
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,000
No.

519
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,950
I’ve asked you a million times.

520
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,700
I mean, it’s just a thumb ring.

521
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,250
Xu,

522
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,900
I can give you

523
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,075
everything I have

524
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,799
except for

525
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,159
this thumb ring.

526
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,520
It’s the only gift

527
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
from my father.

528
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,095
Mr. Fang Haishi

529
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,200
is a woman?

530
00:40:39,225 --> 00:40:39,866
Your Majesty,

531
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,719
Fang Haishi is guilty of deception

532
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,975
and shall be executed.

533
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:45,410
Please look into Jifeng Pavilion, too,

534
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:47,320
which houses Fang Zhuoying,

535
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,280
who attempted to kill you

536
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,050
and Fang Haishi who’s in disguise

537
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,075
as a man to fool you, Your Majesty.

538
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:52,725
We demand severe punishment!

539
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:56,080
Fang Haishi

540
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,080
is my asset there.

541
00:40:58,325 --> 00:40:59,766
End of discussion.

542
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,775
Jichang,

543
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:03,585
I’m tired.

544
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:04,975
Have fun with them.

545
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,369
Good day, big brother.

546
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,869
- Good day, Your Majesty.
- Good day, Your Majesty.

547
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Lord Qinghai,

548
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,675
well...

549
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,679
Your Highness,

550
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:27,800
I’m going to apologize to His Majesty.

551
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,879
Please excuse me.

552
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:30,040
Now isn’t

553
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,150
the right time.

554
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,959
Thank you, everyone,

555
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,399
for being here on my birthday.

556
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,399
If you’re interested

557
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,798
in my eagles,

558
00:41:45,175 --> 00:41:46,840
I’ll have them

559
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,360
delivered to your place later.

560
00:41:48,475 --> 00:41:51,075
- Happy birthday, Lord Chang!
- Happy birthday, Lord Chang!

561
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,420
- We wish you health and longevity!
- We wish you health and longevity!

562
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,269
Stay back!

563
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:13,399
Your Majesty!

564
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:14,900
Your Majesty,

565
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,679
I apologize

566
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,199
for my disguise

567
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,320
over the past years at Jifeng Pavilion.

568
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
My behavior is unforgivable

569
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,000
and I’ll accept whatever punishment

570
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,320
from you.

571
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,300
But please

572
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,620
leave Lord Qinghai out of it.

573
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:28,154
Is that a confession?

574
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,975
I plead guilty

575
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
and I’ll take the consequences.

576
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,000
You,

577
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,600
Fang Jianming

578
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,639
and your clans
can be executed for deception.

579
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,475
It’s all my fault.

580
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,656
Fang Haishi,

581
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,030
if you still want to live

582
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:49,375
and keep Fang Jianming safe,

583
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:50,975
from this moment on,

584
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,360
keep your eyes closed

585
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:53,879
and mouth shut.

586
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:01,679
Guards!

587
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:03,320
Take Fang Haishi

588
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,719
to the side hall,

589
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,760
