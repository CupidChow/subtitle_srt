You are...?

26

My name is Yuran.

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
I’ve prepared

28
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,800
a dress at His Majesty’s order

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
for you to get changed.

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,509
Has Lord Qinghai

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,279
come yet?

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,825
Sorry,

33
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,234
I don’t know anything

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,690
outside the side hall.

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,265
Rise.

36
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,039
I should apologize on my knees.

37
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,136
Get up!

38
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,450
Now you’re apologizing?

39
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,966
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

40
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,314
I saw that thumb ring.

41
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,399
So she’s the one you’d like to

42
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,366
sail off and grow old with?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
After tossing

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
this hot potato to me,

45
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,085
you aren’t here

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,160
only to apologize,

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,279
are you?

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,300
So,

49
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,076
what do you want me to do?

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,880
Please take Haishi in.

51
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,930
Take her in

52
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,995
as my consort?

53
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,519
Your Majesty,

54
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,334
please take her in.

55
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,100
Master!

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,440
Master,

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,480
did His Majesty give you a hard time?

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
His Majesty has decided

59
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,645
to make you his consort.

60
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,750
What?

61
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,970
Your disguise as a man

62
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,000
is a capital crime.

63
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,214
Even I, Lord Qinghai,

64
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
can’t bend the law.

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,841
But His Majesty can have you

66
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,499
to keep you safe,

67
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,945
pacify the court and have you around

68
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,130
to protect him.

69
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,570
Everyone wins.

70
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,839
Is this another plan of yours?

71
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,959
If you’re plotting against someone,

72
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,720
just tell me.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
I won’t stand in your way.

74
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,519
There’s no plan,

75
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,480
no plot.

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,200
I expect you to be

77
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,519
His Majesty’s consort.

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,079
But...

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,519
But you and I just...

80
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,799
You’re gifted

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
and sagacious.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
The moment I saw you,

83
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,225
I knew instantly

84
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,625
you’d be the hope of our state.

85
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,480
All these years,

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,519
you’re the first one

87
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,450
His Majesty has chosen.

88
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,575
It’s your duty

89
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:33,535
to keep him company

90
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,720
and protect him.

91
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,559
You should always

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,239
listen to him.

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,425
Keep him safe.

94
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,720
You planned out every step

95
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,920
and went to such great lengths

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,239
to lure me back to Tianqi

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,025
only to hand me

98
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,559
in a plate to someone else

99
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,700
and ruin the rest of my life?

100
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,040
Tell me you’re joking!

101
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,679
Tell me you’re joking!

102
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,640
You’re kidding, right?

103
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,600
Just say the word!

104
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,050
It’s my life.

105
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,500
You don’t get to

106
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,075
make the decision

107
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,400
for me.

108
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,760
Take her in

109
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,675
as my consort?

110
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,359
Yes.

111
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,880
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,880
Your Majesty,

113
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,150
over the years,

114
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:54,000
I’ve made enemies everywhere.

115
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,909
Now that I’m dying,

116
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,039
I need to plan ahead

117
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,115
to make sure Haishi would be safe

118
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,479
from retaliation

119
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,200
after I’m gone.

120
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
She’s too tough

121
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,119
to bend.

122
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,400
She can be executed

123
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,679
for her impersonation.

124
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,750
Only you

125
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,599
can save her.

126
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,719
Are you entrusting her to me

127
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,960
because you think you’ll soon die?

128
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,975
Physician Li is working on

129
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:34,960
the antidote.

130
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,000
Trust me,

131
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,320
you’ll be fine!

132
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,039
I cherish Haishi

133
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,679
as much as

134
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,200
you cherish Zizan.

135
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,159
I meant to

136
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,760
be with her

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,960
for as long as I could,

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,880
but now, I’m running out of time.

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
My last wish before dying

140
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,440
is to ensure her safety.

141
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
But this

142
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:05,450
is like chipping away

143
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,799
her heart,

144
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,960
and failing her...

145
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,239
I know.

146
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,840
I know how painful this is.

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
But she’ll get through it.

148
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:15,919
She’ll never forgive you

149
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,479
for all that you’ve done.

150
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,000
It’s cruel to her,

151
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,520
but time will heal

152
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,000
all wounds eventually.

153
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,679
After I die,

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
she’ll forget me.

155
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,559
Jianming,

156
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,159
stop saying that!

157
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,880
If you do care about me,

158
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,000
please fulfill my wish.

159
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,280
After I die,

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,159
treat Haishi as if she’s me.

161
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,159
I will.

162
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,440
Jianming,

163
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
I owe you.

164
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,365
Dazheng owes you.

165
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,215
Fang Haishi will be given

166
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,315
all that you should’ve deserved

167
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,716
with dignity and honor.

168
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,330
Now that you’ve entrusted her to me,

169
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,159
I promise that I’ll treat her

170
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,870
like I treat you.

171
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,760
Xu,

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,280
I trust you.

173
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,599
Please don’t let her get hurt.

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,280
(Zichen Hall)
Lord Qinghai

175
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,275
(Zichen Hall)
coaching Fang Haishi on her disguise

176
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:48,556
(Zichen Hall)
is a felony.

177
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,080
Letting that spy of Huku,
Fang Zhuoying, go

178
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,520
is even worse

179
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,880
which jeopardizes national security.

180
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,919
We demand punishment on him!

181
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,840
- Eliminate the wicked
- Eliminate the wicked

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
- and clean house!
- and clean house!

183
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,200
Come on.

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,880
Let’s go.

185
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,075
Master!

186
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,280
- Master!
- Master!

187
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,200
- Master!
- Master!

188
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,000
- Master!
- You...

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,760
Master!

190
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,000
- How did you
- Put this on.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,799
bypass security?

192
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,919
- Master,
- Are you cold?

193
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,679
- your demonstration out here
- Master.

194
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,479
is making your wife worried.

195
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,280
She asked me to bring you a cloak

196
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,150
and a hand warmer.

197
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,599
We thought

198
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,880
Imperial Guards wouldn’t let us in,

199
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,200
but

200
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,000
they didn’t stop us at all,

201
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,880
- so we could get these things in.
- Let me. Have some soup.

202
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,239
Master,

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,239
there’s soup, too.

204
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,200
Have some

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,239
to warm yourself up.

206
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,039
Gentlemen,

207
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,559
His Majesty

208
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,840
still cares about us

209
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,760
and allows servants to bring us cloaks,

210
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,760
hand warmers

211
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,200
and soup.

212
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,479
Thank you, Your Majesty!

213
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,440
- Thank you, Your Majesty!
- Thank you, Your Majesty!

214
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,760
Your Majesty,

215
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,679
beauties are always dangerous.

216
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,479
Please eliminate the wicked!

217
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,039
- Please eliminate the wicked!
- Please eliminate the wicked!

218
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:54,559
Your Majesty.

219
00:13:55,275 --> 00:13:56,075
What?

220
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Somehow,

221
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,960
words are getting out quickly

222
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,525
that officials are demonstrating

223
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:02,024
on their knees outside Zichen Hall.

224
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,086
Their servants are flooding in

225
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:05,835
with warm coats and hand warmers.

226
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,730
Your Majesty,

227
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,039
we can make a fire outside

228
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,300
to keep them warm

229
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,400
as a kind gesture.

230
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,300
No need.

231
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,800
They can kneel as long as they like.

232
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,760
How’s everything at Yu’an Palace?

233
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,225
Consort Shurong is fine.

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,225
The physician has taken her pulse

235
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,880
in the morning and before dinner

236
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,525
and says it’s normal.

237
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,280
But she seems upset

238
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,520
and weeps a lot.

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,875
I see.

240
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,900
You may leave.

241
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,559
Yes.

242
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,575
(Fang Jianming and Ye Haishi
live happily ever after.)

243
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:11,986
Ms. Fang,

244
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,919
it’s freezing. Here’s your dinner.

245
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,050
Eat it now, please.

246
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,239
It’s getting cold fast.

247
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,400
I need to see His Majesty.

248
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,250
Ms. Fang,

249
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,275
right now, censors are kneeling

250
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,479
outside Zichen Hall,

251
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,960
demanding that you be punished.

252
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,400
Even if you could get there,

253
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,280
His Majesty wouldn’t see you.

254
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,100
All the more reason to go.

255
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,075
Ms. Fang...

256
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,425
Ms. Fang,

257
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,320
you can’t get out

258
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
without His Majesty’s permission.

259
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,839
Everyone out.

260
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,839
Stay away

261
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,079
unless I call you.

262
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,475
Your Majesty, I’m guilty

263
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,700
of what I’ve been charged with.

264
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:38,175
Are you trying to get more charges?

265
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,280
What do you think you’re doing?

266
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,300
Well,

267
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,475
why are you so eager to get out

268
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,385
regardless of my direct order?

269
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,450
As you know,

270
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,674
I’m guilty of deception,

271
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:54,906
bending the law

272
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,215
and letting go of a felon.
I’m unforgivable

273
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
and I deserve death.

274
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,875
Death?

275
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:04,336
That’d be easy.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,079
But I’m afraid

277
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,280
that’s no longer an option.

278
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,500
Those officials outside

279
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:09,975
won’t stop fanning the flame

280
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,479
until I die.

281
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
Only my death

282
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,599
will quench the fire.

283
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
Please, Your Majesty.

284
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,199
I said

285
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,075
death is no longer an option

286
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,479
because Fang Jianming

287
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,610
has entrusted you to me.

288
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,850
He can’t do that!

289
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,119
He’s failed

290
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,359
to discipline you after so long.

291
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,040
Where are your manners?

292
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,479
Did I let you up?

293
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,125
Please step aside, Your Majesty,

294
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,520
to not get hurt.

295
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,875
Hurt me?

296
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,800
You’ve made too big a scene already.

297
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,560
Fang Haishi,

298
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,700
don’t push me or I’ll kill you!

299
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:49,646
Do it now.

300
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,719
That’d be greatly appreciated.

301
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,959
Your life

302
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,239
is in my hands.

303
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,725
Fang Haishi!

304
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,560
You assaulted me

305
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,839
but I’ll let that slide.

306
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,575
If you cross the line again,

307
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,000
Fang Jianming will take the blame

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
and die for you!

309
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:26,640
You...

310
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,775
Is everything alright?

311
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,050
Your Highness,

312
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,875
I heard from eunuchs serving the meal

313
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,280
that earlier today
at Dongyu Horse Ranch,

314
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,000
Mr. Fang Haishi

315
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,300
was found to be a woman.

316
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,175
She was found out

317
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,675
after all.

318
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,959
You knew that before?

319
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,215
I found out about her identity

320
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,725
when she saved me that day.

321
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:56,916
Your Highness!

322
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:06,839
Your Highness,

323
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,920
do not

324
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,839
tell anyone else

325
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,119
that you knew

326
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,520
she disguised herself as a man.

327
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,250
She’s committed a capital crime.

328
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,850
A capital crime?

329
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,300
Is His Majesty going to kill her?

330
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,000
Where are you going, Your Highness?

331
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,576
To plead for His Majesty’s mercy.

332
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,825
She saved my life.

333
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,225
I can’t do nothing and let her die.

334
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,479
Your Highness,

335
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:30,496
she’s fine.

336
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,479
You should worry more

337
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,560
about yourself.

338
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,239
Why?

339
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,000
According to the eunuchs,

340
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,400
His Majesty has locked himself and her

341
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,640
in the side hall at Jincheng Palace

342
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,760
since they got back.

343
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,479
They’re still inside now.

344
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,050
Rumors are spreading among servants

345
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,439
that there will soon be

346
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,875
another consort in the Palace.

347
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,700
If she

348
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,880
and His Majesty

349
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,125
can really

350
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
be together,

351
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,701
that’d be nice.

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,400
After all,

353
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,880
she’s kind and sincere,

354
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,880
unlike me

355
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,359
who always makes His Majesty mad.

356
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,040
Your Highness...

357
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,119
It’s no longer warm.

358
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,119
Replace the coals for me.

359
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,130
Go.

- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

374
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,070
Summon the Ministry of Rites.

375
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,655
Uh...

376
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,725
Fang Haishi is going to be
Consort Chunrong.

377
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,350
Oh.

378
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,151
Stewardess Yu,

379
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,839
go inside

380
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,400
and make sure she’s bathed

381
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,451
and ready for her conferring ceremony.

382
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,820
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

383
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,500
Greetings, Your Majesty.

384
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,880
You’re here early.

385
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,350
Did you get any sleep?

386
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,959
I was early to bed,

387
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,199
and early to rise.

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,000
This box of luminous pearls

389
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,429
is my gift to you.

390
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:42,525
Oh, you...

391
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,560
It’s about time. Please get out.

392
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
His Majesty has conferred the title

393
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,461
of Consort Chunrong on you.

394
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,071
That’s great news!

395
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,669
Is it?

396
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,719
Of course.

397
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,319
That title

398
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,760
is given to one of the Three Madams

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
second to the Empress

400
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,175
just like Consort Shurong,

401
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:29,560
but all that you need

402
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,719
prepared by the Ministry of Rites

403
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:32,776
is more befitting the new Empress.

404
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,959
Lord Qinghai

405
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,479
came in before sunrise

406
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,920
with a box of priceless luminous pearls

407
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,599
and said the merfolk blessed you

408
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,599
with those pearls when you were little.

409
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,239
They should be

410
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,079
your dowries.

411
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,119
His Majesty was so glad to have

412
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,520
a blessed one in his harem

413
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,150
that he gave an oral instruction

414
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,719
to Minister of Rites

415
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
to confer a special title on you,

416
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,000
Madam Pearl.

417
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,480
When I first

418
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,160
left Linjie,

419
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,750
I would see

420
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,160
the deep sea

421
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:18,906
rising into tornadoes

422
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,680
and wake up screaming every night.

423
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:27,664
To make me feel better,

424
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,599
Master

425
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,069
put those luminous pearls away

426
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,310
to keep them out of my sight.

427
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,435
And here they are again

428
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,719
after so many years.

429
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,040
Consort Chunrong,

430
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:45,640
you have

431
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,640
a better life ahead of you.

432
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,839
You may leave.

433
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:56,554
I’d like some alone time.

434
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,750
Yes.

435
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:10,879
Please.

436
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,150
Those officials

437
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,520
are still on their knees.

438
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,319
Poor men.

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why are they doing this?

440
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,675
His Majesty won’t take his word back.

441
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Agreed.

442
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,839
Having a consort is his private affair.

443
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,719
His Majesty has never

444
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,959
indulged himself in pleasure before.

445
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,239
A demonstration is unnecessary.

446
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,079
You have a point.

447
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:29,600
Let’s go. Come on.

448
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,040
Let’s go inside.

449
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,025
Let’s go.

450
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,800
I’m worried about them.

451
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,431
The moment I saw you,

452
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,930
I knew instantly

453
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:56,625
you’d be the hope of our state.

454
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:00,264
All these years, you’re the first one

455
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,439
His Majesty has chosen.

456
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,221
It’s your duty to keep him company

457
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,419
and protect him.

458
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,321
You should always

459
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,949
listen to him.

460
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,304
Keep him safe.

461
00:29:24,175 --> 00:29:26,295
All set?

462
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,345
Yes.

463
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:32,400
Aren’t you going to see her?

464
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:35,426
I can’t.

465
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,280
Your Highness,

466
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,500
I made you...

467
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,379
Consort Chunrong!

468
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:46,550
Haishi!

469
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,239
Haishi!

470
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,339
Stop!

471
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:02,705
Yuran,

472
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,350
you may leave.

473
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:05,575
Yes.

474
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:16,875
Give me a hand.

475
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:19,634
It’s against the rules, Your Highness.

476
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,275
I’m ordering you

477
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,681
to turn around.

478
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,380
What’s wrong?

479
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,210
Lord Qinghai,

480
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:36,295
are you afraid

481
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:38,319
that your mind will go wild

482
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,760
when you see my face?

483
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,630
When did you get that cut?

484
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,755
Answer my question!

485
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,040
Consort Chunrong,

486
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,280
it’s time to leave.

487
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:24,754
What a fool!

488
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:26,765
He’d never

489
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:29,599
change his mind for anyone.

490
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,599
What makes you think

491
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,319
you’re any different from others?

492
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,175
Did you get a clear view?

493
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Bite me.

494
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,351
What now?

495
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,055
Are you scared?

496
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,675
Since heaven knows when,

497
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,079
I’ve never felt any pain

498
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,640
or bled again.

499
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,280
Do you know why?

500
00:33:16,175 --> 00:33:17,839
When Dazheng was first founded,

501
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,264
other than the Chu Family,

502
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,586
only Fang Jingfeng was granted

503
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,360
a noble title and a fief.

504
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,225
Since then,

505
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
that title has been inherited

506
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,631
by the Fangs of Liushang.

507
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,520
Their sons

508
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:37,295
were sent into the Palace

509
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,475
before eight years old

510
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,005
to study with the princes.

511
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,040
So far,

512
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,751
we’ve had 53 successors to Lord Qinghai

513
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,925
since Fang Jingfeng

514
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,760
and the same number

515
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,920
of successors to the throne.

516
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,625
Why?

517
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,160
Over the past 670 more years,

518
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,239
not one Lord Qinghai

519
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,239
has lived his full span.

520
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,925
They’ve died of war,

521
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,479
illness, poison, drowning,

522
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,679
thunderbolt or whatnot,

523
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,875
you name it,

524
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,239
leaving a house of children and widows.

525
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,560
Why?

526
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,450
They aren’t

527
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,679
born to fight

528
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,461
but they’re carrying

529
00:34:50,025 --> 00:34:51,305
a unique bloodline.

530
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,620
Lord Qinghai of all generations

531
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,120
is the Emperor’s Baixi.

532
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,399
When a Chu

533
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,560
ascends the throne,

534
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
he’ll make Lord Qinghai

535
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,400
his Baixi.

536
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,840
The Chus

537
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,225
are burdened with

538
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:13,800
state

539
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,239
and family affairs,

540
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,850
while the Fangs

541
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,600
gain wealth,

542
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,075
honor for their family,

543
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,560
a good reputation

544
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,840
and twice the pain and misfortune.

545
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,000
Are you lying?

546
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:40,125
Isn’t he your best friend?

547
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,840
How could you do this to him?

548
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,475
Like I had a choice!

549
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,560
The Rebellion of Prince Yi

550
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
leveled the entire state.

551
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,625
Jianming was the only survivor

552
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,760
of the direct line of the Fangs

553
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,525
and I...

554
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,489
I was

555
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,250
the sole heir to the throne.

556
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,360
In order to protect me,

557
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:13,684
Dazheng

558
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,225
and all those victims

559
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,171
of war,

560
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,519
he chose to be my Baixi.

561
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,679
He’s ended up like this

562
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:33,679
because

563
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,320
he’s eager to protect everyone

564
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,439
expect for himself.

565
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:40,554
No wonder...

566
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,639
No wonder he’s drained

567
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:47,144
terribly fast.

568
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,159
Your Majesty,

569
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,800
it’s time for morning court.

570
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,639
Those kneeling officials

571
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,520
can’t take it anymore.

572
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,461
Fang Haishi,

573
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,159
I don’t care

574
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,750
what you’re going to do.

575
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,611
Just tell me,

576
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,080
do you still care about Jianming

577
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,520
and want him to be safe?

578
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,750
If you do,

579
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,780
there’s something

580
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,399
that only you can do.

581
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,919
His Majesty has arrived!

582
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,040
- Finally!
- It’s him!

583
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,439
- His Majesty is here.
- His Majesty is out.

584
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,439
- His Majesty is here.
- Your Majesty.

585
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,800
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

586
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:38,639
Your Majesty.

587
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,760
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

588
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,959
That evil woman must go,

589
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,719
Your Majesty!

590
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,719
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

591
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,199
A capital crime can’t go unpunished,

592
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,040
Your Majesty!

593
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,439
- It can’t go unpunished!
- Your Majesty,

594
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:49,719
- it can’t go unpunished!
- It can’t go unpunished!

595
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,350
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

596
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,719
You demand an answer, don’t you?

597
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,320
- Please clean house!
- Please clean house!

598
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:02,800
Your Majesty.

599
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,840
Fine.

600
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,679
Let’s talk about it inside.

601
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
- We...
- What...?

602
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,520
- Let’s go.
- Come.

603
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,439
Servant.

604
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,040
Yes, Your Highness.

605
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,679
I need

606
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,800
the most formal gown

607
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,000
and help me get dressed.

608
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,625
Where are you going, Your Highness?

609
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:24,439
Zichen Hall.

610
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:26,320
Your Majesty,

611
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:27,600
aside from

612
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
holding a third-rank post

613
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,639
in court in disguise,

614
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,919
Fang Haishi let the prince of Huku go.

615
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:32,760
That alone

616
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
is worth the death penalty.

617
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,600
Lord Qinghai is planting

618
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,000
a criminal inside your harem

619
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,199
out of an ulterior motive, Your Majesty!

620
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,399
Lord Qinghai

621
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,919
has overreached himself more than once

622
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,719
without being punished.

623
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,250
Your mercy hasn’t made him stop

624
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,625
but only emboldened him further.

625
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:50,919
We demand severe punishments on him.

626
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,080
- We demand severe punishments on him.
- We demand severe punishments on him.

627
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,520
What does me getting a new consort

628
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,800
have anything to do

629
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,919
with Lord Qinghai’s integrity?

630
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,175
Why?

631
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,560
You’re actually ganging up on me, no?

632
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,520
You wouldn’t dare call me lustful

633
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,399
and stupid,

634
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:15,919
so you’re going after an easy target.

635
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,479
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

636
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,159
- We wouldn’t dare.
- We wouldn’t dare.

637
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,479
- Please uphold justice.
- Please uphold justice.

638
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,199
Your Majesty...

639
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,675
No, Lord Qinghai.

640
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,879
If they have a problem with me,

641
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,879
let them speak out.

642
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,840
You always took the blame

643
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,800
for me.

644
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,479
They didn’t get what they wanted,

645
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,725
so they keep

646
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,685
pushing my buttons.

647
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,159
Your Majesty,

648
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:44,840
a new consort can help carry on

649
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,679
the imperial bloodline,

650
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,159
which is great,

651
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,000
but the timing is too sensitive

652
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,439
to convince us.

653
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,239
What do you mean?

654
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,800
That prince of Huku

655
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,280
was Lord Qinghai’s disciple for years.

656
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,879
You think Lord Qinghai is trustworthy

657
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,775
and you can’t be wrong.

658
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:02,199
Now,

659
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,399
this Consort Chunrong-to-be

660
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,040
is his other disciple

661
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,520
who is seen as the blessed one

662
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,479
for her encounter with Dragon Tail

663
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,560
when she was little.

664
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,199
They can’t

665
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,320
all be coincidences.

666
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,675
Lord Qinghai,

667
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:18,975
if she truly is blessed,

668
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,439
why did you say nothing before

669
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,080
but wait until your disciple

670
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,040
returned to Huku

671
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,560
that you gave her to His Majesty?

672
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,280
We’re paid

673
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,360
to share His Majesty’s burden.

674
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,919
We demand

675
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,820
a proper explanation.

676
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,959
Your Majesty,

677
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,959
I’d like to present the luminous pearls

678
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,000
to prove

679
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,280
Consort Chunrong’s childhood experience

680
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,919
is true.

681
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,075
The rest...

682
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:45,755
The rest can wait. One thing at a time.

683
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,900
Luminous pearls!

684
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,120
- Indeed!
- They’re real!

685
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,919
Real luminous pearls!

686
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,840
They’re real.

687
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,150
Yes. Look at the gloss.

688
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,300
- It’s natural!
- So real!

689
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,975
Right.

690
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:17,320
Luminous pearls do exist.

691
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,320
Yes.

692
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,719
They’re real luminous pearls!

693
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,479
- I think so!
- They’re real!

694
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,879
Unbelievable!

695
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,258
They’re rare.

696
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,539
Such good quality.

697
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,639
They are hardly seen.

698
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,200
They must be extremely valuable.

699
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,959
These pearls

700
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,000
are Dragon Tail’s gifts

701
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,890
to Consort Chunrong when they met.

702
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,919
They’re real luminous pearls.

703
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,159
So shiny

704
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,520
and out of this world.

705
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,050
As we all know,

706
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,600
luminous pearls are merfolks’ tears.

707
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,479
I don’t think

708
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,040
they’ve been seen these years.

709
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,950
That’s right.

710
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,775
They’re too rare

711
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,479
to be seen by us.

712
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,075
There’s no proof

713
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:10,525
that those pearls are from Dragon Tail.

714
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:12,399
That woman could’ve also faked them

715
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,900
for what it’s worth.

716
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,800
Your Majesty,

717
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,399
don’t be fooled.

718
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:17,760
That’s right, Your Majesty.

719
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:18,879
Those pearls

720
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,175
could be a stunt

721
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:21,895
to help exonerate Fang Haishi.

722
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,080
It’s easy to tell if they’re real.

723
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,719
Summon her.

724
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,919
Yes.

725
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,875
