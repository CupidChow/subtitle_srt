25
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:20,436
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,494
are you going to ride the horse

27
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,750
or discuss official business
in the study?

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,960
Mr. Liu has submitted his report,

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,320
- and wants to explain to you.
- I’m going to sleep.

30
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,399
Yes.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,075
I’ll go ask him to leave.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,720
The cooks

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
only fawn upon the powerful persons.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,119
They give us unwanted food,

35
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,559
instead of any good dishes,

36
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,360
just because Consort Shurong
isn’t favored now.

37
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,440
Bihong,

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,520
don’t you remember

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,839
what Consort Shurong told us?

40
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,479
Usually,

41
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,960
we should keep a low profile
as much as possible.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
I know Her Highness

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,279
wants a peaceful life in Yu’an Palace.

44
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,559
But Mr. Tang is leaving.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
In Zhunian,
he has known Her Highness

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,600
since childhood.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,520
They’re as close as real siblings.

48
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
Now, he’s going far away.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,639
They can hardly meet again.

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,279
Can’t Her Highness even see him off?

51
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,479
Don’t you know where we live now?

52
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,440
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,160
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,320
Mu Deqing.

55
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:08,854
Yes.

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,119
Go announce my decree.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,700
Yes.

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,950
His Majesty commands that

59
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,479
Chief Commander Tang Qianzi
of Huangquan Pass

60
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,960
will leave Tianqi City

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,839
for Huangquan Pass

62
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:22,025
at seven tomorrow morning.

63
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:22,679
At first,

64
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,759
Tang Qianzi made a contribution

65
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,320
by escorting Lord Chang to Zhunian.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,440
This time, he also made a contribution

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,880
by escorting Princess Tilan
and Lord Chang to Dazheng.

68
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,199
Therefore, Consort Shurong is allowed

69
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,720
to see him off out of the Palace.

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
Respect this.

71
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,196
I’ll leave you alone, Your Highness.

73
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,351
Bizi,

74
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,000
walk them out.

75
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,025
Your Highness,

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,759
are you really going to see Mr. Tang off

77
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,919
as commanded by His Majesty?

78
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,419
I hear

79
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,956
according to the rules of Dazheng,

80
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:12,350
imperial consorts must avoid

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,151
meeting officials.

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:22,425
(Tianqi City)

83
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:23,304
General,

84
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
no one in the court

85
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,799
has come to see you off.

86
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,160
How disappointing!

87
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,204
Because I stayed in Zhunian
for a dozen years,

88
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,345
I’ve lost supporters in Dazheng.

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
When His Majesty entrusted me
with such an important post,

90
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,679
it’s already a great favor for me.

91
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,320
General,

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,959
there’s one hour to go before departure.

93
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,799
Would you like to take a rest?

94
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:49,136
She didn’t go?

95
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,720
For your information, Your Majesty,

96
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,755
Consort Shurong suddenly
had a fever last night.

97
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,100
Her maid sent for a physician
in the midnight.

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,259
The physician said

99
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,679
she indeed had a cold.

100
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,839
Last night?

101
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:03,880
Suddenly?

102
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,640
Maids in Yu’an Palace said

103
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,955
Consort Shurong had been sick long ago.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,760
In case of disturbing too many people,

105
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,480
she didn’t send for a physician.

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,079
Last night, she had a fever

107
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,600
and...

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
And she had to get a physician.

109
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,359
That’s interesting.

110
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,600
Fine.

111
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,139
Let’s go to Yu’an Palace

112
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,040
and see how sick she is.

113
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,880
His Majesty has arrived.

114
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,350
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

115
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,139
I hear you’re sick.

116
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,279
Have you sent for a physician?

117
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,920
For your information, Your Majesty,

118
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,000
the physician just came.

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,350
Oh.

120
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,791
Your palm is indeed hot.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,079
It’s weird.

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,519
You were well yesterday.

123
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,640
Why did you suddenly fall sick?

124
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:29,359
Are you having an epidemic?

125
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,279
If you are,

126
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,760
it’s a big issue.

127
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,610
You’d better
leave the Palace for recovery.

128
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,720
Your Majesty.

129
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:42,775
Yesterday, I asked Tang Qianzi

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,119
to leave for Huangquan Pass.

131
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,480
Today, you suddenly have a fever.

132
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,920
If you don’t have an epidemic,

133
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,839
I’m afraid my decree has hurt you.

134
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,600
What?

135
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,839
I asked you to see him off.

136
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,440
Did it make you scared?

137
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,119
Your Highness!

138
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,359
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,040
Her Highness had
an old illness of asthma.

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,079
Then she had a cold.

141
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,559
So, she was badly sick.

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,359
This morning,
the physician felt her pulse

143
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,320
and said she would get better

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,359
after the recuperation in the Palace
for several days.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Mu Deqing.

146
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,150
Here.

147
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:16,399
She answered before I asked her.

148
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,359
What mistake did she make?

149
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,399
She...

150
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,450
She offended you

151
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,984
and should be sent to prison.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Mm.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,900
Spare me, Your Majesty!

154
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,239
Spare me, Your Majesty!

155
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,040
Say no more.

156
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,880
His Majesty didn’t mean that.

157
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,000
Mr. Tang and I

158
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:35,000
are old friends,

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
but we have no affairs.

160
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,559
Mr. Tang is a good man.

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
He’s a man of integrity,

162
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,380
just like Your Majesty.

163
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,599
I only talked to him

164
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,569
when others were around.

165
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,350
We’ve never gone off the rails.

166
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,575
Please don’t be angry
with him, Your Majesty.

167
00:08:58,025 --> 00:08:59,866
If you suspect me,

168
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,746
I’d like to go to prison.

169
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,359
Officials in the prison are capable.

170
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,479
They can find out

171
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,991
my past

172
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,941
and my old disease.

173
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,950
Do you really offer to go to prison?

174
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,370
Yes,

175
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,866
I want to prove my innocence.

176
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,880
Boring.

177
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,599
- See you, Your Majesty.
- See you, Your Majesty.

178
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,900
Go. Go get a physician.

179
00:09:57,925 --> 00:09:58,764
Your Highness.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,679
Your Highness.

181
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,400
General, time’s up.

182
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,960
Shall we set out?

183
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,630
Get ready to set out.

184
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,635
Yes.

185
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,799
Here,

186
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,520
I bid farewell to Your Majesty

187
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,735
and Lord Chang.

188
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,300
(Tianqi City)

189
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,840
Men are arranged

190
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,039
to investigate examination candidates

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
coming from different places.

192
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,320
Their entourages are
also guarded against.

193
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,159
Businessmen and visitors

194
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,790
will also be strictly checked

195
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,559
in case some people come in disguise

196
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,559
or there are some aberrations.

197
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,599
For the defense of the Palace,

198
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,599
we’ve also arranged

199
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,679
old and trustworthy guards.

200
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,719
They will take shifts,

201
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,280
in case new guards
handle problems improperly

202
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,960
and spies sneak in.

203
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,070
The city defense should be enhanced.

204
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,045
Pay attention to the night patrol.

205
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,000
Everything is important in the Palace.

206
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,359
You must keep His Majesty safe.

207
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

208
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:35,679
Master,

209
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,880
because of the imperial examination,

210
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
Haishi has been pestering me every day.

211
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,565
I’m going to work in the Palace.

212
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,679
When I took the examination,

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
you instructed me

214
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
and I benefited a lot.

215
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,159
Would you like to instruct him, too?

216
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,750
Mm.

217
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,440
Thank you, Master.

Your jade pendant...

244
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,150
Wow.

245
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Master,

246
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:44,719
since when did you

247
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,960
learn to concede?

248
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,479
I didn’t concede.

249
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:50,400
Master,

250
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
don’t be afraid to frustrate me.

251
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
I know what I can do.

252
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,679
I still have a lot to learn.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,039
How’s your work

254
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,880
in the Palace?

255
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:02,119
Well,

256
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,159
there’s no business for today.

257
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,719
Shaozi is in the Palace.

258
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:05,960
Master,

259
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,880
the eunuch said

260
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,559
my new robe has been made.

261
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
I’ll go fetch it.

262
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,925
May I go with Haishi?

263
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,159
- Me?
- Here’s the thing.

264
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,475
Haishi

265
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:15,799
has been staying at home
for quite a long time.

266
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,880
He needs to take a walk

267
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,559
for some fresh air.

268
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,760
So, I’m taking him

269
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,640
to the Fabric Office.

270
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,200
I assure you.

271
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,719
After we go to the Fabric Office
and get my robe,

272
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:22,559
we’ll be back immediately.

273
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,159
Come back early.

274
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,195
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

275
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,400
Master conceded to you.

276
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,559
Go. Quickly.

277
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:42,599
When we go past Ningtai Gate,

278
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,440
and move westwards

279
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,159
to past Yu’an Palace and Renze Palace,

280
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,559
we’re arriving at the North Garden

281
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,475
where embroiderers of the Fabric Office

282
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,400
often go.

283
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,440
- Greetings, Mr. Fang.
- Greetings, Mr. Fang.

284
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,280
Finally, I can walk in the Palace

285
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,250
without concern.

286
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:55,275
Mm.

287
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,599
Look.

288
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,520
Aren’t they the young masters

289
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,280
of Jifeng Pavilion?

290
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,840
Yeah.

291
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,039
The one ahead

292
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,400
is Mr. Zhuoying.

293
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,150
He often comes to the Palace.

294
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,575
But it’s the first time

295
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,960
we see Young Master Haishi.

296
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,925
Sure enough,

297
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:09,159
Young Master Zhuoying is handsome

298
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,640
and Young Master Haishi is good-looking.

299
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,520
Unfortunately, they don’t live
in the Palace

300
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
and we can’t see them every day.

301
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,775
How unambitious you are!

302
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,950
Now, Young Master Zhuoying

303
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,520
works in the Palace.

304
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,919
When can we leave the Palace

305
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,320
and get married?

306
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,325
Let’s go.

307
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,150
You...

308
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,119
Zhuoying,

309
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,850
how long must we keep walking?

310
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,000
Haishi,

311
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,599
if we’re going back
to the Fabric Office,

312
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,710
this is the only route.

313
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,400
I’m asking

314
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,825
when we’re arriving
at the Fabric Office.

315
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,351
What did you ask me?

316
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,799
Fang Zhuoying,

317
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,320
you’ve been

318
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,675
absent-minded lately.

319
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,200
And you often go to the latrine.

320
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,960
You often disappear for the whole day.

321
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:53,520
Are you...?

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,479
Are you sick?

323
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,760
Go get some medicine from the physician.

324
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,875
You...

325
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,280
Who’s sick?

326
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,840
I’m very healthy.

327
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,039
I... I...

328
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:04,760
Fine.

329
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,840
Let’s go, then.

330
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,320
Haishi,

331
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,280
the Fabric Office is right ahead.

332
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,719
With your intelligence,

333
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,750
you’ll find it.

334
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:21,159
I...

335
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,625
I’ve got a bellyache again.

336
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,239
Ah?

337
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:25,350
I’m going to the latrine.

338
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,719
Remember to get my robe.

339
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,675
My robe.

340
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:28,300
Oh.

341
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,300
Didn’t you just go to the latrine?

342
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,559
Fang Zhuoying!

343
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,534
What delicate embroidery!

344
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,599
What do you come for, Miss?

345
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,800
Sorry, sir.

346
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,000
I was practicing

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,079
the blind embroidery Manager taught me

348
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,125
and I didn’t see you.

349
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,040
Sorry to offend you.

350
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,200
Please forgive me.

351
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,731
It doesn’t matter.

352
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:46,760
Are you coming here

353
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,239
to see the Manager of Clothing?

354
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
I’m Fang Haishi with Jifeng Pavilion.

355
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,280
Bowmen Commandant Fang Zhuoying

356
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
is my senior brother.

357
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,560
I came to get his new robe.

358
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,560
You’re Young Master Haishi.

359
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,599
Here she comes.

360
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,359
Young Master Haishi.

361
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,040
Go get the robe.

362
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Young Master Haishi,

363
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,079
come in and have some tea.

364
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,680
Don’t bother, Manager.

365
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,119
Just call me Haishi.

366
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,880
The pouch looks delicate.

367
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,640
Zheliu is clever and deft.

368
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,880
Many people beg her

369
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,119
to embroider some small things.

370
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,119
If you like it,

371
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,520
I’ll ask her to make some pouches

372
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,959
and send them to Jifeng Pavilion.

373
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,800
Young Master Haishi?

374
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,075
Don’t bother.

375
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:33,520
I’m a rough man.

376
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,680
I don’t need it.

377
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,400
I just think

378
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
this pouch looks quite nice.

379
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,400
Young Master Haishi,

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,760
this is the new robe for Mr. Fang.

381
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:46,959
Thank you.

382
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:50,325
Thank you, Miss Zheliu.

383
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,560
Thank you, Manager.

384
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
I’ve got something important to do.

385
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,959
I’ll leave you alone.

386
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,959
Send my regards to your master.

387
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,599
Walk him out for me.

388
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,439
Yes.

389
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,199
This way, Young Master Haishi.

390
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,119
See you.

391
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,040
In a couple of years,

392
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,325
you’ll do better in blind embroidery

393
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,726
than me.

394
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,450
You’re flattering me, Madam.

395
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,439
I still can’t do it

396
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,800
very smoothly.

397
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,439
I’m not familiar with coloring, either.

398
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,150
I need to learn more from you.

399
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,680
I’ll practice harder.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
Liu,

401
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,040
with you,

402
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,680
I’m no longer worried
about the Fabric Office.

403
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,680
Other girls work hard, too.

404
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,479
I heard you

405
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,700
call Young Master Haishi Miss.

406
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,560
I got him wrong, I guess.

407
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,550
I was blindfolded at that time.

408
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,280
I just felt that

409
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,640
Young Master Haishi walked and breathed

410
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,520
differently from other guards

411
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,040
and I thought it was a girl.

412
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,199
When I no longer shaded my eyes,
I knew I was wrong.

413
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,640
Only men work in Jifeng Pavilion.

414
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,079
There can’t be girls.

415
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
Luckily,

416
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,640
Young Master Haishi

417
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,550
didn’t look angry.

418
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,599
Yeah.

419
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,479
How could a girl stay

420
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,920
in Jifeng Pavilion?

421
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,079
Zhuoying!

422
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:18,839
Haishi.

423
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,160
Here’s your new robe.

424
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:23,565
You don’t need to check.
It must be nice.

425
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,839
How do you know?

426
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,680
You know what?

427
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,400
Miss Zheliu of the Fabric Office

428
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
is quite a wonderful girl.

429
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,920
Judged by the small things

430
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,599
she embroidered,

431
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
the new robe will be perfect.

432
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,239
Small things?

433
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,359
Right. Small things.

434
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,479
However,

435
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,479
small things

436
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:40,325
are quite demanding for eyes.

437
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,520
It’s really hard work.

438
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,520
Fang Zhuoying.

439
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,170
Mm?

440
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Why are you sometimes happy

441
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,479
and sometimes sad?

442
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,359
Are you poisoned?

443
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:54,525
What are you talking about?

444
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:57,700
If you don’t like the robe,

445
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,425
I’ll go back to the Fabric Office

446
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,959
and ask Miss Zheliu to modify it.

447
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,319
Speaking of that,

448
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,920
Miss Zheliu looks so beautiful.

449
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,079
Her eyes are like gems.

450
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,439
And her hands...

451
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,819
Her hands are so delicate.

452
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,839
Unlike my rough hands.

453
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,319
What?

454
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,075
Why did you stare at her hands?

455
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:17,600
I...

456
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,079
Why did you stare at her hands?

457
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,119
Rascally!

458
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,160
I’m rascally?

459
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,560
You’re indeed rascally!

460
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,359
What?

461
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,410
Go.

462
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,319
Go back home and squat.

463
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,210
- But...
- Go.

464
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,400
Go get rid of your dirty thoughts.

465
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,359
I...

466
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,311
Rascally!

467
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,496
Zheliu.

468
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,119
Where’s Master?

469
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,580
He won’t have dinner today.

470
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,269
He asked us to have it ourselves.

471
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,701
What is Master doing?

472
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,880
No idea.

473
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,566
Maybe in the middle of something.

474
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:46,585
What are you laughing at, then?

475
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:49,280
I’m laughing?

476
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,165
Why are you asking me?

477
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,100
What were you laughing at?

478
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,119
You looked so happy when you walked in.

479
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,920
Tell me.

480
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,000
What were you laughing at?

481
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,015
I...

482
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,354
I was happy
when practicing martial arts.

483
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:06,874
What... What were you laughing at?

484
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,040
You knocked the jade pendant

485
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,719
off Master.

486
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,154
That was brilliant.

487
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,400
But don’t think

488
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,560
you can succeed in everything.

489
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,199
I’m warning you.

490
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,909
You must avoid conceit and impetuosity

491
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:17,925
and don’t get slack.

492
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,560
When you imitated Master,

493
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,439
you didn’t look like him at all.

494
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,344
See how I’ll deal with you.

495
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,520
Master, are you asleep?

496
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,439
I’ve prepared dinner for you.

497
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:48,880
I won’t have it.

498
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,719
Master,

499
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
are you all right?

500
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,439
I’m fine.

501
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,001
Go to bed early.

502
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:00,959
Yes, Master.

503
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,330
If you want something,

504
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,300
let me know.

505
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,001
Fang Haishi!

506
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:35,520
What are you doing
in the middle of the night,

507
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,439
instead of sleeping?

508
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,680
It’s you.

509
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,560
What are you doing

510
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,359
in the middle of the night?

511
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,359
I came to supervise you.

512
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,040
What’s this?

513
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,331
A pouch?

514
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,520
Fang Haishi, what’s wrong with you?

515
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,599
Instead of sleeping,

516
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,439
you’re secretly embroidering a pouch

517
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,350
in the middle of the night?

518
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:54,599
What an ugly pouch

519
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,760
it is!

520
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:57,439
Even the patches
Shaozi makes on our pants

521
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:58,760
look better.

522
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,439
Who told you I embroidered it?

523
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,030
I...

524
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,595
I picked it up in the North Garden.

525
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,500
North Garden?

526
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,075
Mm.

527
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,280
Which embroiderer of the Fabric Office

528
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,479
would make such an ugly pouch?

529
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:17,280
They would make a better one

530
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
even with their eyes closed.

531
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,959
I...

532
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,439
Who told you

533
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,000
an embroiderer made this?

534
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,959
Do you only know

535
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,400
the Fabric Office?

536
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,640
So many people work
in the North Garden.

537
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,160
How do you know who made this?

538
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,775
Even ordinary girls

539
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,214
wouldn’t make such an ugly thing.

540
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:35,520
Haishi,

541
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,181
no one else is around.

542
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:39,160
When you were having dinner,

543
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,959
you looked lost.

544
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,286
I then knew something was wrong.

545
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,439
If you fall in love

546
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:43,750
with any man in Tianqi City,

547
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,599
just tell me.

548
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,119
You don’t need to make this.

549
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,040
I’ll take my men

550
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,000
and go with you

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,199
to get that man back forcibly.

552
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,680
Fang Zhuoying,

553
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,839
why do you always

554
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,319
think so aimlessly?

555
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:55,160
Is it what we should do

556
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,079
to get someone forcibly?

557
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,079
If you want to do that,

558
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,199
I’ll tell Master

559
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,239
so that he’ll punish you

560
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,000
to copy the scriptures.

561
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,040
200 times.

562
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,640
Look at you.

563
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,160
300 times.

564
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,839
- You’re flushing.
- I...

565
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,000
You’re flushing.

566
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
For your happiness,

567
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,800
I’ll go regardless of anything.

568
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,775
Tell me who he is.

569
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:08,800
I’ll go find him

570
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,079
and get him back to you.

571
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,880
Go... Go get him back.

572
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,040
Fang Zhuoying, leave.

573
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,950
Tell me who he is.

574
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,479
Get out.

575
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,359
Get out.

576
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,280
- Tell me who he is.
- Get out!

577
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,119
I’ll go tell Master

578
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,275
- and get him back to you.
- Get out!

579
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,079
Is it so ugly?

580
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:36,119
I must complete it.

581
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,920
Haishi.

582
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,650
What are you holding?

583
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,534
I...

584
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,891
I...

585
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,020
I’m not holding anything.

586
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,520
Over so many years,

587
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
I’ve kept in mind

588
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,959
what you have taught me.

589
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,880
I’m also very grateful

590
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,959
for your instruction.

591
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:45,560
I...

592
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,640
I’ll work harder.

593
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,119
And... And...

594
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,479
And the imperial examination...

595
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,240
Right.

596
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,900
I’ll work hard for it.

597
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,439
I...

598
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,119
I broke

599
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,500
your jade pendant. So...

600
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,839
So, I made this for you.

601
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,800
(Fang)

602
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:50,880
Fang Haishi!

603
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Fang Zhuoying, you freaked me out.

604
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,100
What happened?

605
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,520
You failed to give the pouch to him?

606
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,199
No.

607
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,880
Then why do you

608
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,839
look so worried?

609
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,951
Because of taking off my clothes.

610
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,490
Taking off your clothes?

611
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,719
What a playboy!

612
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,040
When you gave him a pouch,

613
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
he asked you to take off your clothes?

614
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,400
Fang Zhuoying,

615
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,700
what’s on your mind?

616
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,659
I asked you to read fewer storybooks.

617
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:19,319
It’s...

618
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,160
It’s about the imperial examination.

619
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,029
It requires a body examination
without clothes.

620
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,650
How can I take it?

621
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,800
I’ll be exposed, won’t I?

622
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
It’s indeed a problem.

623
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:33,239
How about this?

624
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,800
Tell them you’re sick.

625
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
No, no, no.

626
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,359
Let’s do this.

627
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,680
Tell them

628
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:40,800
when you took a mission,

629
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,880
you were wounded

630
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,319
and had an unmentionable disease.

631
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,599
Don’t talk nonsense.

632
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:56,966
What do you want?

633
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,599
I hear

634
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:03,936
people become brothers

635
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,839
because they had

636
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,359
a special fate in the previous life.

637
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,520
Zhuoying,

638
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,069
could you...?

639
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,800
Could you take off your clothes

640
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
and go there on my behalf?

641
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,040
Haishi,

642
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,640
I’m always

643
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,359
a bit naughty.

644
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,160
But I’m very rightful.

645
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,975
I took part in the examination
three years ago.

646
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:25,959
When I go again,

647
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,160
what if people recognize me?

648
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,680
Don’t you care for our brotherhood?

649
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,325
I do. I do.

650
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,119
I certainly do.

651
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:34,199
But...

652
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,475
How unfair you are!

653
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,760
You’re too shy to ask Master for help.

654
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,359
But you keep pushing me.

655
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,479
Come on.

656
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,760
I can’t ask Master

657
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:45,520
to go there on my behalf.

658
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,560
Besides,

659
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,439
it’s been three years.

660
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,680
Who can remember you?

661
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,439
There’re even new invigilators.

662
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,479
No one will remember you.

663
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,280
No, no, no.

664
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,280
I don’t want to go.

665
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,199
I won’t go.

666
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,719
In any case,

667
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,880
if you’re recognized,

668
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,800
they’ll let you go.

669
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,839
That’s perfect.

670
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,165
I’m not going.

671
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,545
Zhuoying.

672
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:09,880
I’m not going.

673
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,275
Are you sure?

674
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,599
Sure.

675
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,550
Now that you don’t want to go,

676
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,446
forget it.

677
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:29,855
I can’t force you.

678
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,560
Looks like

679
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,039
I can’t go, either.

680
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,525
Then,

681
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:39,160
I can only stay in Jifeng Pavilion

682
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:41,640
and tell others

683
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,239
why you flushed

684
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,880
in the Fabric Office.

685
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,640
Fang Haishi.

686
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,199
- Right.
- You!

687
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,199
You not only flushed,

688
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,800
but also hid in the latrine.

689
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,839
Were you avoiding someone

690
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,560
or did you fall in love with someone?

691
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:57,959
Haishi.

692
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:58,925
Mm?

693
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:00,256
I’ll go.

694
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,245
Thank you, Zhuoying.

695
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,520
Good posture.

696
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,330
Too thin.

697
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,275
For your information,

698
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:18,760
I’m good at monkey fist.

699
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,280
I must keep

700
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,000
a light body,

701
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,319
instead of being too fat.

702
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,680
Go have yourself portrayed.

703
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:26,125
Write it down.

704
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Next.

705
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,719
Too fat.

706
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,800
For your information,

707
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:36,050
I practice wrestling.

708
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,959
Fine.

709
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,135
Thank you, my lord.

710
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,681
Next.

711
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,525
Posture...

712
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,699
Mr. Fang, you’re indeed a good brother.

713
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,650
You came for your brother,
regardless of your busy work.

714
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:54,475
Where’s your brother?

715
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,281
Here he is.

716
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,560
Here he is?

717
00:33:58,825 --> 00:33:59,640
Fang Haishi!

718
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,050
Fang Haishi!

719
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,000
I am

720
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Fang Haishi.

721
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,750
Mr. Fang,

722
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
don’t make fun

723
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,839
of me.

724
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,199
Three years ago,

725
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,520
I was also an invigilator

726
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
in the examination.

727
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,760
You...

728
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,809
You were the winner that year.

729
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,280
You got me wrong.

730
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,619
That was my brother Fang Zhuoying.

731
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,491
I am Fang Haishi!

732
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,600
But...

733
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,625
(Register of the Imperial Examination)

734
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,500
Some people may look similar.

735
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,239
Mr. Fang is now

736
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,040
the Bowmen Commandant.

737
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,600
Why would he come here

738
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,800
and make fun of you?

739
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,280
You make sense, General.

740
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,919
But I wonder

741
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,560
how we shall deal with it.

742
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,800
He has the household register,

743
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,879
and took the body examination.

744
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,439
Get him in.

745
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,239
We’ll find out
if he’s faking his identity.

746
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,560
Yes.

747
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,950
Fang Zhuoying is an official.

748
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,719
I can’t hurt him.

749
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,445
But if he keeps faking his identity,

750
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,550
he’ll be deceiving His Majesty.

751
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,050
As for Fang Haishi,

752
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,159
keep an eye on them.

753
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,544
Let’s see what trick they’re playing.

754
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,870
Let me know if anything happens.

755
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,400
(Certificate)
Here.

756
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,651
It’s the certificate
of the body examination.

757
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:25,399
Fang Zhuoying,

758
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:26,520
it’s so nice of you!

759
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,879
Keep your voice down.

760
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,080
Don’t let Master know.

761
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,719
Why do we need to be so cautious?

762
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,040
Master didn’t know it?

763
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,575
You think so?

764
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,320
I’m sure Master knew that.

765
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,159
Or how would those people

766
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,360
let you pass the body examination?

767
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,439
They’re not blind.

768
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,639
It was such a humiliating thing.

769
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,679
But you asked me to do that.

770
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,000
If it weren’t humiliating,
I wouldn’t let you go.

771
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:45,900
You!

772
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,760
Thank you, Zhuoying.

773
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,239
You know what?

774
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,479
In the future,

775
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:53,080
you must fight

776
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,159
with what you have learned.

777
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,239
Don’t worry.

778
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,320
I’ve kept in mind

779
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,719
what you have taught me.

780
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,320
Don’t simply strive for victory.

781
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:00,439
- Or...
- Don’t simply strive for victory.

782
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,199
Or you’ll make trouble.

783
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,679
You should play it safe.

784
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,919
Then you’ll handle everything smoothly.

785
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,719
Don’t worry.

786
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,760
Master also taught me
what he has taught you.

787
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,520
Sure.

788
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,720
You’re different, anyway.

789
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,239
I’m different.

790
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,639
But not in a specific way.

791
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I am

792
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,040
Fang Haishi of Jifeng Pavilion,

793
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,080
Fang Zhu’s disciple

794
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,159
and your junior.

795
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,325
When I try, I’m likely to win.

796
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:24,875
It’s ambitious of you!

797
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,280
Where’s Master?

798
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,625
It’s been days

799
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,560
since I last saw him.

800
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,679
I want to see him, too.

801
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,025
I want to say goodbye to him.

802
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:33,575
Mm.

803
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:36,159
Maybe he’s out for some business.

804
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,159
Anyway,

805
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:38,246
thanks.

806
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Go ahead.

807
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:51,023
(Certificate)

808
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,150
Fang Haishi?

809
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,671
Yes.

810
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:58,360
Get in.

811
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,199
Is that Fang Haishi?

812
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:03,840
Get in.

813
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:05,080
Why does he look different

814
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,750
from who he was
in the body examination?

815
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,639
- Yeah.
- Next.

816
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,800
I think so, too.

817
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,760
- Get in.
- He was a strong man.

818
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,719
But now,

819
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,600
- Get in.
- he’s just a weak man.

820
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,919
This is where you live

821
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:17,256
during the imperial examination.

822
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,600
Before the examination ends,

823
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,360
you must obey the rules.

824
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,159
You mustn’t gang up,

825
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
have group fights

826
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
or cheat in the exam.

827
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:30,475
You mustn’t make a noise at night

828
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,155
or stay out of the dorm.

829
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,080
If anyone disobeys the rules,

830
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,379
he’ll be disqualified.

831
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,199
Do you get it?

832
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,341
Yes.

833
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,375
Mm.

834
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,619
Now that you get it,

835
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,760
go have a rest.

836
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,400
My lord,

837
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,900
I have something to report.

838
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,320
Speak.

839
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:53,360
He isn’t Fang Haishi.

840
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,919
I had the body examination

841
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:55,639
with Fang Haishi.

842
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:56,919
Fang Haishi is much stronger

843
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,120
than this man.

844
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,520
This man assumed the identity
of Fang Haishi.

845
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,809
Many people witnessed that.

846
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,120
Yes.

847
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,399
We all saw Fang Haishi.

848
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,959
He didn’t look like this.

849
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,560
This man looks indeed a bit different.

850
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,320
What do you mean a bit different?

851
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,719
They’re totally different persons.

852
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:11,600
Right.

853
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

854
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,439
Who said he was fake?

855
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,200
Here’s the register.

856
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,199
It can’t be wrong.

857
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,719
He’s Fang Haishi.

858
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,600
But he wasn’t the man we saw.

859
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,439
Yeah.

860
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
He wasn’t the man we saw.

861
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,639
My lord,

862
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,159
he isn’t Fang Haishi.

863
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,719
Who witnessed that?

864
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,120
Stand out.

865
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,439
Let me remind you of one thing.

866
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,840
I have the register.

867
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,520
If you identify the wrong person,

868
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,159
you’ll be disrespecting me

869
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,439
and the court!

870
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
You’ll be disqualified for the exam

871
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,040
and never be hired.

872
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,120
What...

873
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,254
Don’t forget
you’re examination candidates.

874
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,461
All you should care for
is the examination.

875
00:38:58,925 --> 00:38:59,879
Fang Haishi,

876
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:03,900
the innermost bed is yours.

877
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,120
Thank you, my lord.

878
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,224
This is the examination hall.

879
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,679
Let me remind you.

880
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,290
Never act rashly

881
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,069
or gossip.

882
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:18,040
If you make any mistakes,

883
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,840
you’ll influence nothing,

884
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,080
but your own future.

885
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:22,764
Do you hear me?

886
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,619
Yes, my lord.

887
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,991
Dismiss.

888
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Go.

889
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:39,360
I wonder

890
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
which noble family

891
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,479
this useless man is from.

892
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,280
For the sake of his family background,

893
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,159
he can do anything he wants.

894
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,560
I’ll wait and see.

895
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:47,959
Even if he forcibly gets qualified

896
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,080
for the examination,

897
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,959
how long can he keep showing off?

898
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,199
Yeah.

899
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,639
Maybe when I punch him,

900
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,480
I’ll break some of his ribs.

901
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,879
Is it because he looks so weak

902
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,439
that he asked someone else

903
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:01,966
to take the body examination for him?

904
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,080
That’s easy for you to say.

905
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:06,840
Do you know

906
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,800
that Mr. Fang

907
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,280
is from the Fang Family of Liushang?

908
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
In every generation,

909
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,360
there were countless heroes
in his family.

910
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,425
Not to mention his ancestors,

911
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
even the previous master
of the Fang Family

912
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,639
was Lord Qinghai Fang Jianming,

913
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,971
the best of Six Generals.

914
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:19,399
He made the biggest contributions

915
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,679
to suppressing
the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

916
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,520
You are hicks

917
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,639
from the countryside.

918
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,760
You don’t deserve to frame him.

919
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,800
Yeah.

920
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,320
I think you’re just framing him!

921
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,190
Who do you mean?

922
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,840
I mean you. Just you!

923
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,560
I mean you!

924
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,360
Who do you mean?

925
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,879
How can you compare yourselves

926
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:32,919
to the Fang Family of Liushang?

927
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:33,760
- I mean you.
- What?

928
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,959
- I just mean you!
- Say it again!

929
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:35,520
- I just mean you.
- What?

930
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,080
Say it again.

931
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,950
Don’t you dare say it again!

932
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,719
Everybody,

933
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:45,479
now that we’re here

934
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,550
to take part in the examination,

935
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,080
why do we bother to argue?

936
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,719
I may not have a chance

937
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,479
to concede to you.

938
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:52,800
Let’s just compete

939
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,320
with our martial arts.

940
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,080
Commander.

941
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:22,399
Is that done?

942
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,239
Yes.

943
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:27,725
I think

944
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,646
we have made so many enemies.

945
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,381
Someone may take this opportunity
to make trouble.

946
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,199
We don’t need to worry about that.

947
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:40,035
Someone is spying on them.

948
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:42,550
Now that they want Haishi

949
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,510
to take part in the examination,

950
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,925
they’ll certainly make him

951
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:46,399
pass the body examination.

952
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,479
However,

953
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,760
you must keep a close eye

954
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
on the examination,

955
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,840
in case

956
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,600
someone makes trouble for Haishi.

957
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,560
I get it.

958
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:46,520
Go.

959
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Quickly.

960
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,040
Without evidence,

961
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:58,120
you think I came
with the blessing of my ancestors.

962
00:43:58,275 --> 00:43:59,634
I’m quite curious.

963
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,875
If a man can’t succeed

964
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,639
without the blessing of ancestors,

965
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,239
which member of a family

966
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,600
can be the first one

967
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,520
to succeed?

968
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:15,479
It’s ignorant of me.

969
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,120
I don’t know

970
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,560
that emperors and nobles

971
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,000
get their posts

972
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,239
out of the void.

973
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,199
You judge people
by their backgrounds. How pedantic!

974
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:29,840
In a fight,

975
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,399
you know nothing about your opponents.

976
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,560
How stupid!

977
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:34,840
With your little talent

978
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,760
and ambition,

979
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,754
you came to the examination?

980
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:41,320
Luckily, you met no one,

981
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,000
but me.

982
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,751
I’d like to play with you.

983
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,000
I’m so pissed off.

984
00:44:58,525 --> 00:44:59,846
What’s wrong with you?

985
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,840
Instead of sleeping at night,

986
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,560
you got up and made trouble?

987
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:04,679
Do you still want to...

988
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:07,235
What...

989
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:08,719
What...

990
00:45:08,825 --> 00:45:09,719
What happened?

991
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:11,679
Explain.

992
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:15,325
Ah?

993
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:18,760
I don’t know.

994
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,000
I was sleeping.

995
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,000
I got up to urinate

996
00:45:23,275 --> 00:45:24,725
when I just saw them

997
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,199
have bruises on their faces.

998
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,120
I don’t know who did that.

999
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,040
It’s ridiculous.

1000
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,399
He even punched their faces.

1001
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,520
I wonder if these men

1002
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,120
still look like

1003
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,125
their pictures on the certificate.

1004
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:35,725
You!

1005
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,040
You punched us first!

1006
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:39,360
Ren Yong,

1007
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:40,320
explain.

1008
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,479
Look how fiercely

1009
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:42,520
he punched you!

1010
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,159
It’s him. He punched me.

1011
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:46,919
Guo Dacheng,

1012
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:47,840
you say it.

1013
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:49,536
What exactly happened?

1014
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,160
My lord,

1015
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,159
I can be the witness.

1016
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,870
I just saw with my eyes

1017
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,120
that these men

1018
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,260
were punched by Fang Haishi.

1019
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,800
Mm.

1020
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,719
Fang Haishi,

1021
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,630
why did you do that?

1022
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:07,760
I...

1023
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,125
Fighting without a reason

1024
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,080
will get you disqualified.

1025
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,760
My lord,

1026
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,271
Fang Haishi only fought back.

1027
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,025
They tried to harm him first.

1028
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,305
Mr. Fang didn’t mean any harm.

1029
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,239
No, you... you...

1030
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:22,775
You!

1031
00:46:29,025 --> 00:46:29,550
Mm.

1032
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,120
My lord.

1033
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,185
Don’t think no one else witnessed you.

1034
00:46:36,575 --> 00:46:38,216
I have irrefutable evidence.

1035
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:41,159
You ganged up,

1036
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:42,040
tried to bully Fang Haishi,

1037
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,579
and provoked him.

1038
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,050
He’s innocent.

1039
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:45,600
What?

1040
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:48,879
All right.

1041
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,221
Get back for some sleep.

1042
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,580
Don’t make trouble again.

1043
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Or you’ll be punished accordingly.

1044
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,329
Do you hear me?

1045
00:46:57,475 --> 00:46:58,919
Yes.

1046
00:46:58,919 --> 00:46:59,550
Go ahead.

1047
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,825
Thank you.

1048
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:13,639
You’re welcome, Mr. Fang.

1049
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,679
We take part in the examination

1050
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,274
because we want to serve our state.

1051
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:19,159
Even if such scoundrels

1052
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,850
become winners in the examination,

1053
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,036
they won’t be good officials.

1054
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,911
May I have your name?

1055
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:26,716
I’m He Chong.

1056
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:28,040
Mr. He.

1057
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,520
Mr. Fang.

1058
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,040
We’re of the same grade now.

1059
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,360
Thanks to your help,

1060
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,800
I’m out of trouble.

1061
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,639
So, I called you Mr. Fang.

1062
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:37,959
Is that appropriate?

1063
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,690
Yes. Yes.

1064
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:41,679
I’ve got nice wine.

1065
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:42,679
If you want a drink,

1066
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:43,350
come to me at any time.

1067
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,679
I’ll let you enjoy it.

1068
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,790
It’s so nice of you, Mr. He.

1069
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:49,560
Unfortunately, we’ve got
an examination lately.

1070
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,520
Drinking causes trouble.

1071
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,520
How about waiting
until the examination ends?

1072
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,760
I’ll prepare a meal

1073
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,479
with some dishes.

1074
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:56,750
We can eat and drink

1075
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,850
till the day breaks.

1076
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,360
All right.

1077
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,761
Let’s wait until we win.

1078
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:01,840
By then,

1079
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:03,280
drinking for the whole day

1080
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,334
won’t even be enough.

1081
00:48:04,825 --> 00:48:05,585
That’s for sure.
