Bizi!

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,160
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you alright?

29
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,425
My stomach hurts.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,175
Oh, no!

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,559
Your Majesty,

32
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,839
Physician Li needs you back

33
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,960
to the side hall of Jincheng Palace.

34
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,199
What happened?

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,440
Consort Shurong had abdominal pain

36
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,360
and showed signs of bleeding.

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,679
Not to worry, Your Majesty.

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,925
She's stable now.

39
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,000
Rise.

40
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,679
Does it still hurt?

42
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,250
I'm fine.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,700
The acupuncture

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,399
has already stopped the pain.

45
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,479
Do you know the cause?

46
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,080
Your Majesty,

47
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,960
the...

48
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,160
the contraceptive decoction

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Her Highness overdosed on

50
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,039
could increase the risk of miscarriage

51
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,650
and the changing weather

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
these days

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,880
brought out those symptoms.

54
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,720
The good news is

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
Her Highness is much stronger
than before

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,350
with light bleeding.

57
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,399
I'll prescribe her herbs

58
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,479
for nourishing.

59
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,880
After taking them for a few days,

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,119
she'll feel better.

61
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,625
She's fragile.

62
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,279
Make sure all those herbs are safe.

63
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,199
Yes.

64
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:59,279
I'll be very careful.

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
You may leave.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,919
Good day, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Be careful.

68
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,064
I'm good.

69
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,785
I'm no longer in pain.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,925
It's all my fault.

71
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,250
If I hadn't been so mean

72
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,079
and given you
all that contraceptive decoction,

73
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,300
you wouldn't have been so weak.

74
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,480
Back then,

75
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,135
I was as stubborn as you.

76
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,239
Neither of us would step back.

77
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,160
If there's anyone to blame,

78
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,679
that should be me because I meant to

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,279
kill myself with that decoction.

80
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,050
Don't beat yourself up,

81
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,500
or I'll feel guiltier.

82
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,170
By the way,

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,175
I had drafted an edict

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,050
to make

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,375
our baby

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,875
my successor.

87
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,375
Once it's born,

88
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll have Mu Deqing take it out

89
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,000
and make it public.

90
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,359
Your Majesty,

91
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,160
we don't know it's a boy

92
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
- or a girl yet.
- So what if it's a girl?

93
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,880
The world,

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,475
no,

95
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,400
Zhongzhou alone

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
has been ruled by

97
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,519
several female emperors

98
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,760
who are most venerated.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Why can't our daughter be my successor?

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,519
Other than that,

101
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,559
I'm

102
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,620
also making you my new Empress.

103
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,160
The ceremony will be held

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,450
after you give birth

105
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,920
and make a full recovery.

106
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:55,200
I've never coveted that post.

107
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:56,486
If you don't take it,

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
it'll remain vacant

109
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,239
and

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,075
officials will continue nagging me

111
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,760
to decide on the new Empress.

112
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,200
Do you want them

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,720
to talk my ear off?

114
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,445
I can't

115
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,679
thank you enough, Your Majesty.

116
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:16,665
If you want to thank me,

117
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:18,625
just take good care of yourself.

118
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,875
I gave you that Dream Catcher.

119
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,655
I've kept

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
everything you've given me.

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,040
Come.

122
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,830
Seeds?

123
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,875
They're Jifeng Tree seeds.

124
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:09,600
You once told me

125
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,200
that you'd like to have a Jifeng Tree

126
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:12,645
at home in Yuezhou.

127
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,119
That way,

128
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,731
your life would be complete.

129
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,440
With these seeds,

130
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,600
you'll have your own Jifeng Trees

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
and you can see them anytime

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,119
instead of

133
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,359
missing the one at Zhaoming Palace.

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,140
How about we plant the seeds together?

135
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:25,575
Sure.

136
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:35,119
I've been thinking about

137
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,470
all those things

138
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,000
we can do together.

139
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,995
In spring,

140
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,800
we can catch butterflies.

141
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,600
In summer,

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,480
we can go fishing.

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,519
In autumn,

144
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,959
when my nails grow long enough,

145
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,559
we can paint them with dried madder.

146
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,880
In winter,

147
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,119
we can

148
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,940
have a snowball fight in the yard.

149
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,040
And

150
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
I want a big dog, too.

151
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,440
When we have children,

152
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,880
all of us

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,320
can play games in the yard.

154
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,119
We have plenty of time

155
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,725
to do them one by one.

156
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:08,825
Yes.

157
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,800
We'll get them all done.

158
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:11,600
Of course.

159
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,414
How does it taste?

160
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,475
It's good.

161
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,320
That's a relief.

162
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,640
I watched them

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,160
making it earlier.

164
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,925
That's so sweet of you.

165
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,200
You could've had others bring it in

166
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,960
instead of coming here yourself.

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,559
If I hadn't come,

168
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,520
I wouldn't have known you're sick.

169
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,719
Sister,

170
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,000
you're carrying a baby.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,525
You need more rest.

172
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,400
I didn't feel uncomfortable at all

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,275
until today.

174
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,880
The physician has said

175
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,840
it's nothing serious.

176
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Don't worry.

177
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,650
I see.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,500
Sister,

179
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,960
I can't help with your treatment

180
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,705
but there's one thing I can do.

181
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,640
Give me your pendant.

182
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,640
I need it to bless you

183
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,760
and your baby.

184
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,700
Bless us?

185
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,325
Yes.

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,599
I've brought with me

187
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,559
a priest

188
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,960
who's Dragon Tail's servant,

189
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,200
but he isn't allowed

190
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
to come here.

191
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,150
I can bring your pendant

192
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,520
to him for blessing

193
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,239
and then return it to you.

194
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,320
Then

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,550
you'll be more blessed.

196
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:41,400
Uh...

197
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:43,840
Is there a problem?

198
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,880
Or is it

199
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:46,799
also not allowed

200
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,359
to take your pendant out?

201
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:50,625
Not that.

202
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:52,559
This Dragon Tail Pendant

203
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,359
has never left me.

204
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,239
We grew up together.

205
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,320
How could I not know?

206
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,080
But the more the blessing,

207
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,799
the better,

208
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,950
am I right?

209
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,039
Well, then,

210
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,250
thank you, Suolan.

211
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,119
No need.

212
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,880
We're family.

213
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,200
"High are the mountains,
and small is the moon.

214
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,119
Small, but shining pure.

215
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,119
My mind goes far away to someone.

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,559
A day with him

217
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,039
would upset me so."

218
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,559
When you

219
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,039
taught me this poem,

220
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,799
I never thought

221
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,185
the one I fell in love

222
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,271
would sit across me,

223
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,599
let alone

224
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,675
cook dishes for me.

225
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:50,760
Have a taste.

226
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,430
Is it good?

227
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,039
It's a little bit salty.

228
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,599
My cooking

229
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,359
is still not as good as Xu's.

230
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,039
His Majesty can cook?

231
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,119
Of course.

232
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,440
He's dexterous.

233
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,559
When we had family banquets,

234
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,440
unlike Zizan who'd never cook,

235
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,080
Xu would always

236
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,160
make his signature dishes.

237
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,200
But that was

238
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,760
a long time ago.

239
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,050
Speaking of Empress Zizan,

240
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,800
are she and Tilan

241
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,039
identical?

242
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,356
Their looks, yes,

243
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,535
but personalities, no.

244
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,239
In fact,

245
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,810
Empress Zizan

246
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:46,666
was as candid

247
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,505
as you.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
A few years ago,

249
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,166
Xu was irritable.

250
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:56,235
He'd punish others
over the slightest thing.

251
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,239
But he's lenient with you

252
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,520
even though

253
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,239
you've offended him over and over.

254
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,559
You've only been given light punishment

255
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,719
for all that mess.

256
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,760
Come to think of it,

257
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,150
although I've never met Empress Zizan,

258
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,840
somehow,

259
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,821
she's been protecting me.

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
All these years,

261
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,440
others all think

262
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,831
I've been tolerating Xu

263
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,690
or even indulging him,

264
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,555
but the truth is,

265
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,440
I just want to protect him.

266
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,599
The tougher he looks on the outside,

267
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,039
the softer he is on the inside.

268
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,200
He lost Zizan all of a sudden.

269
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,559
It was like

270
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,665
his world crumbled.

271
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,400
As the Emperor,

272
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,640
he couldn't share

273
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,240
his pain with anyone.

274
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,200
Luckily,

275
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,239
he has Tilan now.

276
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,320
They cherish

277
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,359
and love each other.

278
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,320
He finally has someone

279
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,280
to talk to.

280
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
Otherwise,

281
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,359
I'd feel guilty

282
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,760
about pulling you away

283
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,280
from him.

284
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,256
He's lucky

285
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,065
to have Tilan's company.

286
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,239
And

287
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,200
you?

288
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,661
I'm the luckiest.

289
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:21,364
Jianming,

290
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,640
the wind

291
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,340
makes me chilly.

292
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,559
Let's go back inside.

293
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,044
(His Majesty
and Consort Shurong are fine.)

294
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,960
(Don't worry.)

295
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,520
What's that?

296
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,440
Nothing.

297
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,159
I saw it.

298
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm being completely honest

299
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,601
but you're not?

300
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,919
I can tell you

301
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,320
but don't be mad.

302
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,561
I won't.

303
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,575
When we left Tianqi,

304
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,175
I thought

305
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,080
you'd still think about His Majesty,

306
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,950
so I reached out

307
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,320
to Zhang Chengqian.

308
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,599
He'd send me information

309
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:15,599
about His Majesty every now and then

310
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,100
when he was

311
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,520
in Tianqi.

312
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:21,239
This is

313
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,840
the first time

314
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,159
I've received his message.

315
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't worry.

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,479
He...

317
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,719
He doesn't know anything.

318
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,000
He doesn't know about your fake death,

319
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,225
or my whereabouts

320
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,119
and actions.

321
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,000
Are you mad

322
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,400
that I went behind your back?

323
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,370
Of course not.

324
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:45,215
You did it for me

325
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:47,544
because if I knew His Majesty is fine,

326
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,599
I could enjoy

327
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,000
my life better.

328
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:52,544
I appreciate that.

329
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:55,039
So how is he?

330
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,575
He's doing pretty well.

331
00:16:58,275 --> 00:16:59,074
That's good.

332
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,400
I made soup.

333
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,599
Do you want some?

334
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,575
Sure.

335
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:15,985
General Tang,

336
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,850
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

337
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:19,875
You rode horses to death, didn't you?

338
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:22,640
Is what you said in the letter

339
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,719
all true, Prince?

340
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,719
You saw my sister's pendant.

341
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,100
Isn't that enough?

342
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,959
It never left her before.

343
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,359
She was desperate

344
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,920
and asked me to show it to you for help.

345
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,479
How is she doing now?

346
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,920
She's suffering a lot.

347
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,040
Emperor Xu

348
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,199
has refused to make her pregnancy public

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
and confined her to her place.

350
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,359
I begged him

351
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,439
to see her,

352
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,160
and when I was there,

353
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,375
I found he was blaming Zhunian

354
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
for that fake Lord Chang.

355
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,520
My sister was covered with bruises

356
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,719
and even bled a few days ago.

357
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,079
She wouldn't have told me any of that

358
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,160
if not pressed,

359
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,510
because she knew
I'd confront Emperor Xu.

360
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:23,400
He almost

361
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
strangled her to death once

362
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,736
and gave her all that
contraceptive decoction.

363
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:29,640
I can't believe

364
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,011
he's hurting her even more.

365
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,920
My sister said

366
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,980
she's scared

367
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,075
that her baby might die inside her.

368
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,580
General Tang,

369
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,599
Zhunian is weak.

370
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,300
Emperor Xu doesn't respect us

371
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,199
at all,

372
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,079
or he wouldn't have tortured my sister.

373
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,000
So I'm thinking

374
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
if I don't

375
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
fight for her,

376
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,640
her life

377
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,040
will get even worse.

378
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:06,880
What do you want me to do?

379
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,880
Keep the baby but not the father.

380
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,239
Kill Emperor Xu.

381
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,891
Make my sister's child the Emperor

382
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,120
and her, Empress Dowager Regent.

383
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
But we don't know it's a boy or a girl

384
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,920
before Consort Shurong gives birth.

385
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,319
That's easy.

386
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,275
I'll have a new-born baby boy ready

387
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,319
when my sister

388
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,520
is in labor.

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,561
If she's delivered of a boy,

390
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,195
that'd be perfect.

391
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,551
Otherwise,

392
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,640
we'll say

393
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,719
she has a boy and a girl.

394
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,079
She can still be Empress Dowager

395
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,080
and get to keep her own daughter.

396
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,729
Isn't that a win-win situation?

397
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:55,920
Is she on board with this idea?

398
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,400
She's living in hell.

399
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
Why not?

400
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,119
General Tang,

401
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,880
what's holding you back?

402
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,119
Don't you remember

403
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,199
how well my sister treated you

404
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,400
when you were in Zhunian?

405
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,175
Look, Sister.

406
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,025
Our priest

407
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,839
gave his blessing on it day and night

408
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,479
and purified it with holy water.

409
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,425
It'll protect you.

410
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,520
I appreciate all his work.

411
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,640
I'll have Bizi

412
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,760
prepare gifts.

413
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,359
Don't forget to bring them

414
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,560
to him.

415
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,239
No need.

416
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,400
I've got that covered.

417
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:31,719
Sister,

418
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,640
Bizi said

419
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,425
you're still feeling unwell.

420
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,190
I'm always weak.

421
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,880
But the physician said

422
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,000
I'd be fine

423
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,239
after taking medicine.

424
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,839
Sister,

425
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,119
I heard

426
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,775
the hot spring at Diequan Valley

427
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,319
around Tianqi is really good.

428
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,000
Given your condition,

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,479
you can ask His Majesty

430
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,160
to stay there for a few days.

431
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,800
People still think I'm in confinement.

432
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,040
I can't go out.

433
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:04,400
Fine.

434
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,920
I meant to spend more time with you

435
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,479
before returning to Zhunian,

436
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:09,640
but your health

437
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,199
is the most important.

438
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,199
You're going back?

439
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,280
Yes.

440
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,479
I should've left after paying respect

441
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,199
to Dragon Tail,

442
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,839
but I wanted to see you

443
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,119
and extended my stay till now.

444
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,959
Father has urged me in his letter.

445
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,959
I can't be away for too long

446
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,359
with all that work undone.

447
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,000
I understand.

448
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,880
As the heir to the throne,

449
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,599
you have your responsibility.

450
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,199
You'll only get

451
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,479
busier and busier.

452
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,680
Don't forget to take care of yourself.

453
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,359
I will.

454
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,599
You too, Sister.

455
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,079
It's getting late.

456
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,520
I shall take my leave.

457
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,920
I'll come again to see you

458
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,525
and bid farewell
to His Majesty before departure.

459
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,775
Sure.

460
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,199
See you.

461
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:56,000
See you.

462
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,640
Commander!

463
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Commander,

464
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,760
urgent news just arrived

465
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,599
from Huangquan Pass.

466
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,800
Your Majesty,

467
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,575
we have an emergency.

468
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,575
What is it?

469
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,119
I just learned

470
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,640
that Commander-in-chief
of Huangquan Battalion,

471
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,675
Tang Qianzi, had deserted.

472
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,875
His whereabouts are unknown.

473
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,520
When did this happen?

474
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:37,760
10 days ago.

475
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,119
10 days?

476
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Why are we only knowing this now?

477
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,439
He claimed to be too sick
to leave his room

478
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,119
and had his guards outside.

479
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,239
Later, when members of Jifeng Pavilion

480
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,319
got suspicious

481
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,400
and went to check in secret,

482
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,599
they found

483
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,880
he had killed two guards planted

484
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
next to him by Jifeng Pavilion

485
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,160
and left with a dozen followers

486
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,520
long ago.

487
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:04,640
Check the army

488
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
in secret

489
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,644
for anything strange lately.

490
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Yes.

491
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,725
Wait.

492
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,000
Who's guarding Tianqi

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
with the troops?

494
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,880
It's Zhang Chengqian.

495
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,760
I need to see him.

496
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,040
Yes.

497
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:29,358
(Tianqi)

498
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,025
Greetings, Your Majesty.

499
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,319
Zhang Chengqian,

500
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,119
when you left Huangquan Battalion,

501
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,280
was there anything abnormal?

502
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,599
At that time,

503
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,599
General He Yao was training soldiers.

504
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,800
Everything seemed fine.

505
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,000
He Yao was new there.

506
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,119
Did he get along well

507
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,599
with others?

508
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,079
He needed more time

509
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,000
to fit in.

510
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,479
Your Majesty.

511
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:13,560
Your Majesty,

512
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:14,880
more bad news.

513
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,199
It's about Huangquan Battalion.

514
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:17,239
Several members there

515
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,719
died silently of an unknown poison

516
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:19,959
five days ago.

517
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,280
Tang Qianzi's assistant

518
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,599
confined General He Yao,

519
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,359
gathered Tang Qianzi's old force

520
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
and left Huangquan Pass.

521
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,640
I'm afraid

522
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,520
they're going to attack Tianqi.

523
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,560
What?

524
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,680
Zhang Chengqian,

525
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,640
how many of your troops

526
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,375
are stationed in Tianqi?

527
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,520
About 15,000.

528
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,750
Shaozi,

529
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,640
how many men do we have

530
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,959
in Secret Force and Imperial Guards?

531
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,200
Some 10,000.

532
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,560
That's 25,000 in total.

533
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,050
Zhang Chengqian,

534
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,160
have them

535
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,560
close all the city gates

536
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,119
and get ready for defense.

537
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,125
Yes.

538
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,880
Shaozi,

539
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,520
fly pigeons

540
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,920
to inform all local Inspectors

541
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,319
to send reinforcements to Tianqi.

542
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,350
Yes.

543
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,479
Hold on.

544
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,319
Use the fastest horses

545
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,319
to call for backup as well.

546
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes.

547
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,280
Your Majesty,

548
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:10,880
should we inform...?

549
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,470
I've let him go.

550
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,025
Don't bother him.

551
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,680
I've fought countless battles.

552
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,719
Are you doubting me?

553
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,119
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

554
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,150
I'm on it.

555
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,875
(Tianqi)

556
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,680
- Step aside!
- Step aside!

557
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,925
- Move!
- Move!

558
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,560
Go away!

559
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:43,875
(Tianqi)

560
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,079
What's going on?

561
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,920
What's happening?

562
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,818
- Go!
- Go!

563
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:47,998
- Get in!
- Go!

564
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,920
Go!

565
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,680
Go, go, go!

566
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,889
- Keep moving!
- Go!

567
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,550
Close the Gate!

568
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,119
Your Majesty,

569
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,920
we're all set.

570
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:33,975
Good.

571
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,860
They outnumber us

572
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,175
and they're eager

573
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,800
to end this fast.

574
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,359
A raid tonight is possible.

575
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
We need to stall them as long as we can.

576
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,959
Stick to defense instead of offense.

577
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:48,920
Once the reinforcements arrive,

578
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,680
we'll have a chance to win.

579
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:53,700
Go, go, go!

580
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:54,825
Go!

581
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,325
- Hurry up!
- Keep going!

582
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,040
Bizi.

583
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:04,760
Bizi!

584
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes, Your Highness.

585
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
What's going on outside?

586
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,825
Why are they yelling?

587
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:12,199
I don't know much

588
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,359
but it seems

589
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,239
that rebels are going to attack Tianqi.

590
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:16,880
His Majesty is deploying troops

591
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,775
to defend the city and the Palace.

592
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,680
Rebels from where?

593
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:23,640
Don't know.

594
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,000
His Majesty is at the front line

595
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,100
and probably

596
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,550
won't be back tonight.

597
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,104
The night sky is beautiful.

598
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,479
I once read in historical records

599
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,025
that all the stars

600
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:40,280
would change

601
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,839
overnight.

602
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,750
Their positions

603
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,800
would shift.

604
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,400
But

605
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,479
as far as I remember,

606
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,750
they're where they are.

607
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,680
Is it true that stars can move?

608
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,280
I guess so if it happened before

609
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,719
like the historical records say.

610
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,079
We just

611
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,275
can't see it.

612
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,640
Look,

613
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,800
that star

614
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,374
seems brighter.

615
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,774
That's Qingxu,

616
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,120
one of the few big stars.

617
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,280
It's said

618
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,839
to represent

619
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,150
the fate of the Emperor of East Land.

620
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,280
His Majesty's fate?

621
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,800
Does

622
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
the brighter star mean

623
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,650
His Majesty

624
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,800
is in the prime

625
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,000
of his life?

626
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,400
I believe so.

627
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,560
What does it say?

628
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,500
Tang Qianzi's assistant broke in

629
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,839
and confined He Yao.

630
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,959
They're gathering their old force

631
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,875
to attack Tianqi.

632
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,525
We're caught unprepared

633
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:35,160
with a little over 20,000 troops
in the capital.

634
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,319
His Majesty has had all the Gates closed

635
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:40,035
and everyone is ready to battle.

636
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,381
What is Tang Qianzi thinking?

637
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,479
He's making a desperate move.

638
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,719
Tianqi is lacking force

639
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,800
and His Majesty needs reinforcements

640
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,199
from all the Inspectors.

641
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,640
But they're inexperienced
in the military.

642
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,050
Their force might not arrive in time.

643
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,479
The fastest way

644
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,560
is to have Chen Heran

645
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
send out troops from Yuezhou.

646
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm afraid I can't go there with you.

647
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,160
Because you're going back to Tianqi.

648
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,719
Split up then.

649
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,800
Let's go.

650
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,275
I worked with Tang Qianzi.

651
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,375
A smart man like him

652
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,719
wouldn't revolt

653
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,439
to grab power.

654
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
He cares about Tilan.

655
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,680
I think he's doing this for her.

656
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:26,880
Rest assured.

657
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,239
I'll be there as soon as possible.

658
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:31,035
Wait for me.

659
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,760
Be very careful.

660
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,199
Vanguard,

661
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,040
charge.

662
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,359
Take the Gate!

663
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:44,920
Yes!

664
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,479
Ready!

665
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:05,880
Fire!

666
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,359
Pour!

667
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,600
(Tianqi)

668
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,040
General Tang,

669
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,679
they're prepared.

670
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,358
Vanguard is suffering heavy losses.

671
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,919
They've got ready

672
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,211
in a few hours.

673
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,000
That's fine.

674
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,325
Pass my order.

675
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,479
Charge again.

676
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,525
Yes!

677
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:41,959
General Zhang,

678
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,350
here are the arrows.

679
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:43,959
Guys,

680
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,399
take the arrows.

681
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,575
- Yes!
- Yes! Go!

682
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Go!

683
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,479
Hurry!

684
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,080
Your Majesty,

685
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,800
they can't take the Main Gate

686
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,879
and they're now targeting

687
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,919
East and West Gates separately.

688
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:26,919
General Zhang said

689
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
whenever the rebels come

690
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,239
and wherever they attack,

691
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,639
he'll guard the Gate with his life.

692
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,879
He gives you his word.

693
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,840
Tell him

694
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,199
all the troops

695
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,800
have been sent

696
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,525
to assist him

697
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:38,320
except for a few

698
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,080
in the Palace.

699
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,879
It's life-and-death.

700
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,080
Hang on till the backup arrives.

701
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,399
I'll be out to fight with you

702
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,639
if necessary.

703
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,959
Yes!

704
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,209
Mu Deqing.

705
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

706
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,000
Take Tilan

707
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,639
to the secret chamber.

708
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,520
If they break in,

709
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,679
people will die.

710
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,879
She can't get hurt.

711
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,475
If we lose,

712
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,239
you know the safe passage

713
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,320
to get her out of the Palace.

714
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,239
Your Majesty...

715
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,080
Go!

716
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,199
Yes.

717
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,959
Greetings, Your Highness.

718
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,360
We're taking you to a safe place

719
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,025
at His Majesty's order.

720
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,879
Are the rebels charging in?

721
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,000
What about His Majesty?

722
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,479
He's overseeing the battle.

723
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,225
He wants to ensure your safety first.

724
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:35,840
If he's staying,

725
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,360
then so am I.

726
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,625
- His Majesty...
- Your Highness,

727
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:39,719
there's no time.

728
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,719
Don't be stubborn.

729
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,520
The troops need His Majesty.

730
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,280
If you stay,

731
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
he'll be distracted

732
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,000
and held back.

733
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,239
No time to think!

734
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,250
Don't forget about your baby.

735
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,360
Just do what His Majesty says.

736
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,120
Where are we going?

737
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,159
This is the outermost wall

738
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,425
of the Palace.

739
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:24,950
Your Highness!

740
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,800
I was only told to take Consort Shurong

741
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,959
to the weakest spot.

742
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:31,840
You...

743
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,925
You killed them!

744
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,639
Secretary Shi lied to you.

745
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,639
Don't blame us.

746
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:44,560
Let's go.

747
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,350
The carriage is right outside.

748
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,399
What?

749
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,600
Tilan is gone?

750
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,399
What to do?

751
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,239
What happened?

752
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:55,840
Your Majesty...

753
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,120
What's going on?

754
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,199
Say it!

755
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,050
Your Majesty,

756
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,239
eunuchs came

757
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,439
with your order just now

758
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,600
to take Consort Shurong

759
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,719
to a safe place.

760
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,800
Shortly after she and Bizi

761
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,120
left with them,

762
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,320
Eunuch Mu came

763
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,000
for Consort Shurong, too.

764
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,120
I'd never entrust her

765
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
to strangers!

766
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,525
You fool!

767
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,575
Your Majesty,

768
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:15,950
we found bodies

769
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,719
of eunuchs and Imperial Guards

770
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:17,650
at a remote corner.

771
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,360
Commander Chen,

772
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:21,065
have Secret Force find her.

773
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,199
Turn the whole city upside down

774
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,775
if they have to!

775
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,700
Yes.

776
00:38:32,425 --> 00:38:34,550
You're awake, Your Highness.

777
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,159
Bizi,

778
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,750
what's going on?

779
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,639
Where are we?

780
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,360
Your Highness,

781
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,325
this is...

782
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,450
The sealed mansion

783
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,320
of Lord Chang

784
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:58,320
and the perfect hideout.

785
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,525
Suolan?

786
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,650
What are you doing here?

787
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,439
I set the trap

788
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:08,199
and I'm here to see

789
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,919
the Emperor of Dazheng get replaced.

790
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,325
It's your trap?

791
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,725
And those rebels...?

792
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,600
I got them here, too.

793
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:18,199
They're led by

794
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,639
General Tang Qianzi.

795
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,525
Tang Qianzi?

796
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:25,125
I should thank you for it.

797
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,575
Everyone likes you.

798
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:27,950
You're having

799
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,520
the Emperor of Dazheng's baby.

800
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,199
His general is also willing to

801
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,879
fight for you.

802
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,639
You've made things

803
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,500
so much easier for me.

804
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,300
What do you want?

805
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,239
I want what's best

806
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,400
for Zhunian.

807
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,199
I'm sick of our neighbors

808
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,950
and Dazheng looking down on us.

809
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,760
I'm sick of depending on their handouts

810
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,800
at the cost of your marriage.

811
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,679
You refused to come to Dazheng,

812
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,879
didn't you?

813
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,710
Now, we can change everything.

814
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,639
Once the rebels kill Emperor Xu,

815
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
your baby

816
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,159
will become

817
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,879
the new Emperor

818
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,320
and you,

819
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,959
Empress Dowager Regent.

820
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,439
Zhunian will gain respect and power.

821
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,550
Respect and power

822
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,471
can only be earned,

823
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,080
not be grabbed.

824
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,800
Suolan,

825
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,280
you're usurping the throne

826
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,399
and will be cursed by all!

827
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,120
"A thief loses his life.

828
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,040
A usurper gains power."

829
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,080
The end

830
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,640
justifies the means.

831
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,950
Besides, Tang Qianzi is the traitor.

832
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,239
Zhunian doesn't know anything.

833
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,391
I only came back

834
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:38,150
to protect you.

835
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,600
How could you be so cruel?

836
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:44,800
In order to keep you from rebels

837
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
in case they break into the Palace,

838
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:47,800
I had people

839
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,040
get you out

840
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:51,639
and asked General Tang

841
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,639
to send in over 100 crack troops

842
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,100
in advance

843
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,100
for your safety.

844
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,525
Sister,

845
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,719
how is that cruel?

846
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,919
If you cared

847
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,360
even the slightest bit about me,

848
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,560
you'd never harm my husband!

849
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,360
I won't let you do that.

850
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,199
Sister,

851
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,879
there's still time.

852
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,040
Think again.

853
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,040
Wealth, fame

854
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,700
and supreme power
are at your fingertips.

855
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,600
Or would you rather die with Emperor Xu?

856
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,959
Even so,

857
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:37,800
you'll have to wait

858
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,600
until that baby is born.

859
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:48,760
Bizi,

860
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:50,394
watch her closely.

861
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:52,345
Don't let her do anything stupid.

862
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:53,725
Well...

863
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,360
Yes.

864
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,520
Suolan.

865
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,305
Does Father know

866
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:13,239
any of this?

867
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,775
I'm following

868
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,439
his exact order.

869
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:37,080
Congratulations, Prince,

870
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,959
on getting Consort Shurong out.

871
00:42:40,175 --> 00:42:41,719
All thanks to your plan, Secretary Shi.

872
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,650
Excellent work.

873
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,975
I'm only doing my job.

874
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:47,400
Prince, you picked

875
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,320
a perfect place

876
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,199
to be our hideout.

877
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,840
Few can house

878
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,239
