25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,759
Master's message is

26
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,319
for me to go to Zhaoming Palace alone.

27
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,639
Did he say why?

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,559
No.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,039
He asked you to go

30
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,200
once you wake up.

31
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,039
You should have woken me up.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Lord Qinghai said
you're too tired lately

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,520
and told us not to wake you up.

34
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,050
(Zhaoming Palace)

35
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,325
Master asked for me,

36
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,975
so all of you may wait outside.

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,550
Yes.

38
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,039
You want me, Master?

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,839
Sit.

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,240
What is it that you wanted to see me?

41
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,405
I have something to tell you.

42
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,074
Where is everyone else?

43
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,839
They're all out on missions.

44
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,399
By the way,

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,279
I got your favorite

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,719
osmanthus candies.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,320
I got a letter from Zhuoying today.

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,679
Dear Master,

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
a while ago,

50
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,000
Duoluo made another attempt

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
by attacking us with a small number
of troops.

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,299
To protect me, Tara

53
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,160
was shot by an archer

54
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:18,655
and passed away.

55
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:25,239
To avoid

56
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,320
a massacre in Huku,

57
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,279
I rode out alone

58
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,691
and lured Duoluo to the open.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,099
Do you want to wrestle with me?

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
You and I are brothers,

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,290
but today,

62
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,125
only your death

63
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,119
can allow me to enjoy

64
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,880
the fresh air on the grassland.

65
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,335
Let me show you your defeat.

66
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,760
I defeated Duoluo in the end,

67
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,636
and kicked him out of the grassland.

68
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't let you down.

69
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,679
Now,

70
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm Lord of Left Pudun,

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,559
Duohan.

72
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,205
Peace is resumed.

73
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:46,955
There's no more war on the grassland.

74
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,399
I know he's a sharp sword.

75
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,519
Now the sword is drawn

76
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
and shows its blade.

77
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,791
He belongs there.

78
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,386
I knew he'd
get what he wants eventually.

79
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,399
Haishi,

80
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,839
Hanzhou is at peace.

81
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,259
Lord Chang is in custody.

82
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,326
Tribes in Leizhou

83
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,375
have forged an alliance with Dazheng.

84
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,150
The world

85
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,555
is at peace at last.

86
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,075
Yes,

87
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,519
the world is finally at peace.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,250
So what's your plan?

89
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,519
Plan?

90
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,119
I sent you to the Palace

91
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,040
because I had no time

92
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,359
to plan for the future.

93
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,359
I was afraid when I died,

94
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,195
Lord Chang would hurt you.

95
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,275
I know you.

96
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,399
You hate to stay in the Palace.

97
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,200
You like freedom.

98
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:53,880
No one

99
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
can hurt you now.

100
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,200
Wherever you want to go

101
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,025
and whatever you want to do,

102
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,920
His Majesty will allow it.

103
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,119
Are you trying to push me away again?

104
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:09,640
No.

105
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,125
I want to go with you.

106
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,799
His Majesty promised me

107
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,720
to terminate Baixi with me

108
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,039
when all the problems are solved,

109
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,760
and allow me to resign.

110
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,990
I know you.

111
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,239
You must want

112
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,280
to leave as soon as possible.

113
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,150
All I'm asking is,

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,545
can I go with you?

115
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,975
Wherever you go and whatever you do,

116
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,119
I wish I could

117
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,080
stay by your side.

118
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:00,719
Why...

119
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,195
Why do you want to stay by my side?

120
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:14,745
Because I love you.

121
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,300
I know that

122
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,925
the moment

123
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,000
I sent you to the Palace,

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,119
I no longer deserve

125
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,239
to say it.

126
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,270
But Heaven pities me

127
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,725
and led you to a miracle

128
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:34,679
that can save my life.

129
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,520
I really don't want
to waste any chances.

130
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,111
I don't mind if you hate me

131
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,880
or choose not to forgive me.

132
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,475
I deserve it.

133
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:45,400
I understand.

134
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,150
But I hope you can at least

135
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,111
give me a chance,

136
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,050
one last chance,

137
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
to replace the memories

138
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,359
that hurt

139
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:00,559
and broke your heart,

140
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,159
with happy

141
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,630
and beautiful memories. Can you?

142
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:12,919
What if...

143
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,739
What if my answer is no?

144
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,239
Then please write letters to me,

145
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,919
or visit me from time to time.

146
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,919
Fang Jianming!

147
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,960
How could you give up just like that?

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,320
Do you know...

149
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,359
Do you know how long I have been waiting

150
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,799
for you to say it?

151
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,000
I thought I wouldn't

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,799
hear it for the rest of my life.

153
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,440
How could you change your mind

154
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
soon after you spoke it out?

155
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,239
Sorry.

156
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,159
I apologize.

157
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,164
Whatever you do and wherever you go,

158
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,919
I'd like to stay with you.

159
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,359
I will do anything, alright?

160
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,119
Anything?

161
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:07,725
Yes.

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,719
From now on, you can't

163
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,200
keep anything from me.

164
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,320
You have to tell me.

165
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,125
Mm.

166
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,359
Wherever you go,

167
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,359
take me along.

168
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,200
Even if it's life-threatening,

169
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,159
as I said,

170
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,200
you take me along.

171
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:27,320
I promise.

172
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,119
You'll grow old together with me,

173
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:32,280
and we'll have children.

174
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,479
Sure.

my Lord Qinghai and Consort Chunrong

Jianming,

250
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,000
is it necessary for us

251
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,719
to exchange gratitude?

252
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,225
However,

253
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,039
when you leave,

254
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,400
I'll have

255
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,955
no friends or brothers around me.

256
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,919
Are you worried about Lord Chang?

257
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,239
I know

258
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,599
as the emperor,

259
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,440
I shouldn't be partial to anyone.

260
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,500
But I got news
from the Imperial Prison today

261
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,275
that Jichang often talks nonsense.

262
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,319
The physician said

263
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,479
he might have gone crazy.

264
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,359
However,

265
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,880
the appeals

266
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,760
that urge me

267
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,025
to punish Jichang severely

268
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,200
are piling up on my desk.

269
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,839
I know

270
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,485
Jichang is ought to be executed.

271
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,119
But he...

272
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,439
is the last family

273
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,839
I have in this world.

274
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,750
And he's sick now.

275
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,079
I can't do it.

276
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:45,400
Jianming,

277
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,839
Jichang has lost

278
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,119
all the support,

279
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
and any chance to start a coup.

280
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:53,325
If

281
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,359
I want to put him under house arrest,

282
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,439
what will you say?

283
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,100
It's only human nature

284
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,119
for Your Majesty

285
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,401
to want to spare your brother.

286
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,359
But there's solid
evidence of Lord Chang's

287
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:05,839
multiple murders.

288
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:08,239
If Your Majesty

289
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,680
handles it without caution,

290
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,335
your fairness will be questioned.

291
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,675
Besides,

292
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,160
Lord Chang excels in hiding his capacity

293
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,969
and biding his time.

294
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:21,560
If Your Majesty

295
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,880
keeps him by your side,

296
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,239
I'll be worried.

297
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,239
I hope Your Majesty

298
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,680
can give it a second thought.

299
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,450
Alright.

300
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,000
I see.

301
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,920
The poison in your body hasn't
been removed.

302
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,119
You shouldn't stand for long.

303
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,520
Go back and rest.

304
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,839
Good day, Your Majesty.

305
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,239
How fresh the fruits are!

306
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,640
Your Highness doesn't have to

307
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
bring the fruits over

308
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,239

from Zhunian.

312
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,719
- I don't even remember
- Oh.

313
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,959
how many horses died to carry them.

314
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:14,160
I want His Majesty

315
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
to have some when they're fresh.

316
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,640
In case they're bruised,

317
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,275
I sent them over personally.

318
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,875

Eunuch Mu,

321
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,280
I haven't been allowed yet

322
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,300
to visit my sister, Tilan.

323
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh.

324
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
Would you please

325
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,160
send some of the fruits to Yu'an Palace?

326
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,319
Sure, no problem.

327
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,359
I'll see to it.

00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,719
you can count on me.

330
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,200
Then I'll report to His Majesty.

332
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,199

What's on your mind?

335
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,079
Does the little one

336
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,239
give you a hard time today?

337
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,659
No, the baby is good.

338
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,239
It's just

339
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,825
I haven't had any of the fruits

340
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,464
from my hometown for a long time.

341
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:34,839
They remind me of home.

342

343
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,199

He said the fruits

348
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,280
were for me.

349
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,050
Actually, they're for you.

350
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:50,925
I

351
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,920
owe it to you.

352
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,680
He's been

353
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,719
thoughtful since he was a child.

354
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,650
Yes.

355
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,640
Suolan

356
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,400
told me so much

357
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
about your childhood.

358
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,150
What did Suolan tell you?

359
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,724
He told me

360
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,760
his mother died a long time ago,

361
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,880
and life wasn't easy

362
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,425
in the royal palace of Zhunian.

363
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,525
He also mentioned

364
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,239
your mother had never been favored,

365
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,815
so your early life was also difficult.

366
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,950
But no matter how difficult it was,

367
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:31,624
you had always supported him

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,681
and never refused to help him.

369
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm touched by his sincerity.

370
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,475
So I allow him to stay longer in Tianqi.

371
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,920
When it all settles down,

372
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll arrange for you to meet him.

373
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,600
It's a merry thing to reunite
with your family.

374
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:51,775
You're lucky.

375
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,340
Your Majesty.

376
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,650
We'll come up

377
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:10,575
with a better idea

378
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,800
to deal with Lord Chang.

379
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,025
Don't worry about it.

380
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:20,359
Even Jianming advises against it.

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,389
Both Boyao and Shuyun passed away.

382
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,536
Now, Jichang is mad.

383
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,081
Perhaps in a royal family,

384
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,425
we don't afford to be brothers.

385
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,650
No way.

386
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,959
No way.

387
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,950
It's impossible.

388
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:08,439
I don't believe it.

389
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,111
I don't believe it.

390
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,500
Time to eat.

391
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:25,550
(Shut up if you want
to keep your family safe)

392
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,560
Prince Suolan,

393
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,359
what's all this

394
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,806
in the early morning?

395
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:22,839
You may rise.

396
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,359
Your Majesty,

397
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,375
I'm here to confess.

398
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,700
Confess?

399
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,280
Yes.

400
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:30,760
In the morning,

401
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
I found a startling secret

402
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,725
in an urgent message from my father.

403
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,239
It's about Your Majesty.

404
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,400
I dare not conceal it,

405
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,760
so I hurried into the Palace.

406
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,640
It wasn't found until today.

407
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,599
My father and I are accountable for it.

408
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,839
We...

409
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:49,325
What is the secret?

410
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,680
The one in the Imperial Prison

411
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,085
isn't Your Majesty's brother.

412
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,075
Well...

413
00:25:57,075 --> 00:25:59,575
Your Majesty's brother has passed away.

414
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:00,745
Huh?

415
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:01,900
What?

416
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,160
News about Lord Chang's coup

417
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,561
was delivered to Zhunian Palace.

418
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,199
One of Lord Chang's

419
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,520
former servants got drunk

420
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,839
and spilled the beans

421
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:19,435
to other servants.

422
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,319
I'm not surprised

423
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,475
at Jichang's coup at all.

424
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,885
Jichang

425
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,495
and the emperor of Dazheng

426
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,680
are not real brothers.

427
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,725
- Huh?
- Huh?

428
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,040
The real Lord Chang

429
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,439
drowned in the Palace by accident

430
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,160
soon after

431
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:47,400
he came

432
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,250
to Zhunian.

433
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,075
Huh?

434
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,680
I know about it.

435
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,479
But that year,

436
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,280
for fear of losing their lives,

437
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:59,079
the servants found someone

438
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,000
who resembled the boy

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,525
- to fill in the blank.
- Really?

440
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,450
He's a fake.

441
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:09,800
When my father learned about it,

442
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,880
he had the servant tortured

443
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,239
and found a lot more details.

444
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,280
He also found

445
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,760
where... where Lord Chang was buried.

446
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
This is a confession
of the people involved.

447
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,700
Your Majesty.

448
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,160
The witnesses and Lord Chang's remains

449
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,081
are on their way to Dazheng.

450
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,359
Your Majesty,

451
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,475
we were so blind

452
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,640
that the servants cheated us

453
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,694
under our very noses.

454
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:39,625
I ought to be punished!

455
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,359
No way.

456
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,319
Brother.

457
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,479
Brother.

458
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,119
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:14,479
Spare my life.

460
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,079
Spare me, Brother.

461
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:17,959
Brother,

462
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,199
I'm sorry.

463
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,880
Brother.

464
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,575
Brother.

465
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,220
Since you were put in
the Imperial Prison,

466
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,725
I've been recalling the past.

467
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,075
During the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

468
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,119
you helped

469
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,550
in Zhunian.

470
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,319
During the fake princess's coup,

471
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,700
you risked your life

472
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:11,846
for the sake of mine.

473
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,500
Mm.

474
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Do you remember you said that

475
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,760
as long as I'm nice to you,

476
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,365
you'll be nice to me?

477
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,675
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,391
I'm a fool.

479
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,450
I'm a fool, Brother.

480
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,650
Brother.

481
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,955
Brother.

482
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,920
But are you my brother?

483
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,359
Bro... Brother.

484
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,400
Brother!

485
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,239
Get in.

486
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,150
Don't listen to their lies.

487
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,239
Get in.

488
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:04,839
Brother!

489
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
They just want me dead.

490
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,914
Don't listen to their lies!

491
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:26,839
This is what happened.

492
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,920
What do you think?

493
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:29,680
This is big.

494
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,839
We can't give full credit
to the confession.

495
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,839
I'll have Jifeng Pavilion's
secret guards

496
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,599
go to Zhunian and investigate.

497
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,160
How long will it take?

498
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,359
If this is true,

499
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,160
I won't give him

500
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,100
one more day to breathe.

501
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,341
Your Majesty,

502
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:49,560
if you want to find the truth,

503
00:30:49,775 --> 00:30:52,000
I might have an idea that'll work.

504
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:52,865
Tell me.

505
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,040
Through physical contact,

506
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,640
Lang Huan can read one's memory.

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In the last few days,

508
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,561
she's regained her strength.

509
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,560
With your permission,

510
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,104
I can take Lord Chang to the pond

511
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,436
and give Lang Huan a try.

512
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:07,680
Granted.

513
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,319
Go at night.

514
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,751
Don't let anyone else know.

515
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,125
Son,

516
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,884
don't hate me.

517
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,696
If I didn't sell you,

518
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,295
you would starve,

519
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,791
and your brothers and sisters

520
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,221
would also starve.

521
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:21,560
Mother, don't cry.

522
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,075
I'm fine.

523
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,999
Don't you cry.

524
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,075
It's about time.

525
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,125
Let's go.

526
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,479
He does look a lot like the boy.

527
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,000
If you want your family

528
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,475
to live a better life,

529
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,100
don't ask questions.

530
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:40,640
From now on,

531
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,250
you're the prince of Dazheng,

532
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,239
Jichang.

533
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Someone will teach you

534
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,439
the customs of Dazheng

535
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:52,175
and everything about Prince Jichang.

536
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,044
He's not the real Lord Chang, is he?

537
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,375
No.

538
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,560
Leave us.

539
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,079
I thought

540
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:54,615
Emperor Xu would announce it

541
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,654
and dismember me piece by piece.

542
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,280
Unexpectedly,

543
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,330
he sent you with poison.

544
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,280
It's merciful of His Majesty

545
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,676
to grant you a decent death.

546
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,320
Merciful?

547
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,239
Merciful.

548
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,100
You people who are born noble

549
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,800
are never merciful!

550
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,719
You're all

551
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,520
hypocritical.

552
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,075
Mercy?

553
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,719
Say it for yourselves!

554
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,600
So...

555
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,875
So I have to be strong

556
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:52,625
and noble, like you,

557
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,676
so as to protect myself

558
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,950
from the bullies.

559
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,360
Nobility

560
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,059
has nothing to do with your birth.

561
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:06,359
I grew up in a fishing village.

562
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:10,075
My mother was a fisherwoman.

563
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,115
But she gave up her life

564
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,280
for the lives of all.

565
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,679
Even if you unified Novoland,

566
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,080
she dwarfed you

567
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,679
in nobility.

568
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,675
Madam Pearl,

569
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,320
don't give me

570
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,879
the silly nonsense.

571
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:40,045
I don't understand.

572
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,479
You don't understand,

573
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:48,846
and you don't have to.

574
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,879
I learned all about it.

575
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,640
It should have been me to do it.

576
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,199
I want to kill him

577
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,925
to avenge my mother's death.

578
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:57,639
You look pale.

579
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,239
Your hands are cold.

580
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,650
I thought

581
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:04,719
killing him would

582
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:06,595
make me happy.

583
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:10,040
It doesn't.

584
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,300
When I think about it,

585
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:13,840
it makes me feel

586
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,439
so sad and sorry.

587
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:17,199
It's all karma.

588
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
We all have to pay the price

589
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,560
for what we do.

590
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,120
Let it go.

591
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:26,399
Master.

592
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,919
His Majesty is furious about it.

593
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,280
But he chose to keep it a secret

594
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,000
and gave up a public execution.

595
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
Why?

596
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,000
Probably for Consort Shurong's sake.

597
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,479
For Tilan?

598
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:39,879
Although

599
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,425
Prince Suolan revealed

600
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,800
the truth to His Majesty,

601
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,360
the authenticity of the confession

602
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,879
is yet to be proved.

603
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,159
It's hard to tell if the King of Zhunian

604
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,520
knew about it earlier,

605
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,639
but chose to keep it a secret

606
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:54,280
for fear of confrontation.

607
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,080
If we announce it

608
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,560
and launch an open investigation,

609
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
we might find something.

610
00:37:59,975 --> 00:38:01,719
His Majesty wouldn't want to see it.

611
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,600
If Zhunian is involved,

612
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:06,239
Tilan will probably be put

613
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,679
in an awkward position in the Palace.

614
00:38:08,825 --> 00:38:10,600
If Zhunian is involved,

615
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,959
the officials

616
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,879
will make appeals

617
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,479
to His Majesty

618
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:17,399
to remove Consort Shurong's title.

619
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,479
Her pregnancy is due.

620
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:21,439
If it takes a turn for the worse,

621
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,360
not only her mood,

622
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:24,560
but also

623
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,120
the baby's future will be affected.

624
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,679
If she gives birth to a prince,

625
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,239
it'll be difficult

626
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:31,864
for him to be chosen
as the crown prince.

627
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,919
For the sake of Consort Shurong

628
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,760
and the baby,

629
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,679
His Majesty has to bear with it.

630
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:39,675
But

631
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,040
Tang Qianzi went to Zhunian

632
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,850
with Lord Chang when he was young.

633
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,600
He...

634
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,239
It's not a good time to investigate him.

635
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,705
His Majesty's decision is we stay put.

636
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,080
His Majesty

637
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,479
considered everything for Tilan.

638
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,225
However, in this way,

639
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,040
the civilians will condemn him

640
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,844
for being so callous

641
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,679
to put his last living brother

642
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:02,879
to death.

643
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,040
If they do,

644
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,879
His Majesty probably will reply,

645
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:09,280
"I have a bad reputation already.

646
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:11,646
I don't mind one more condemnation."

647
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,910
His Majesty has gone through a lot.

648
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,331
What's up?

649
00:39:24,025 --> 00:39:25,280
It occurs to me that

650
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:27,959
His Majesty put in a lot of good words

651
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,520
for you the other day.

652
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,760
And that's the last thing
he said about you.

653
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:33,080
"Jianming...

654
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,080
He has gone through a lot."

655
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,280
You two

656
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,159
are closer and more like brothers.

657
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,479
I've always been curious

658
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,300
about what he said to you.

659
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,679
A lot.

660
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:45,074
He told me about your past.

661
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,320
His Majesty understands you.

662
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:49,120
Rest assured.

663
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,879
Now, I know you better

664
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:51,800
than His Majesty.

665
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,360
I will be with you

666
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,120
in everything,

667
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,520
and won't let you

668
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,679
go through those things alone.

669
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,456
I will also stand by you in everything,

670
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,040
spoil you,

671
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,280
love you,

672
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,959
make you happy,

673
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
and do nothing else.

674
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:17,520
Summon

675
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,639
Commander of Huangquan Battalion,
Zhang Chengqian,

676
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,199
trooper, Ren Yong,

677
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,479
Xiao Wu,

678
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,479
Wu Yang,

679
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,800
Guo Dacheng,

680
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,025
to the hall.

681
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:47,840
Commander of Huangquan Battalion,
Zhang Chengqian.

682
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,320
Trooper, Ren Yong.

683
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:50,585
Trooper, Xiao Wu.

684
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:51,919
Trooper, Wu Yang.

685
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,250
Trooper, Guo Dacheng.

686
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,880
- Greetings to Your Majesty.
- Greetings to Your Majesty.

687
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,120
Rise.

688
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,600
You did a great job
defending your emperor.

689
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,679
Reward them.

690
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,860
His Majesty's edict,

691
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,399
Commander of Huangquan Battalion,
Zhang Chengqian,

692
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,520
be conferred General Mingwei,

693
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,280
and rewarded 100 taels of gold

694
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:20,439
and a set of the finest housewares;
