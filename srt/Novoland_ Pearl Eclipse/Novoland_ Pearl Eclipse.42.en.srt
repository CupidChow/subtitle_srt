- Good day, Your Highness.
- Good day, Your Highness.

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,240
Lord,

28
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,775
has Consort Chunrong left?

29
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,700
Yes.

30
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,900
Knowing that she’d come

31
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,880
for your lecture,

32
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,679
we had the kitchen

33
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,550
make her favorite desserts

34
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,625
and osmanthus sugar yesterday.

35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Too bad, she didn’t get to have some

36
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,839
before leaving.

37
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,725
That’s fine.

38
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,800
I’ll have them make more

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,075
when she comes next time.

40
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,191
There’s no next time.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,559
No one likes

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,119
being given the cold shoulder.

43
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,199
And come to think of it,

44
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,320
her days at Zhaoming Palace

45
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,720
weren’t exactly pleasant.

46
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,080
This place no longer

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
means anything to her.

48
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,050
Lord,

49
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,160
it’s cold.

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,275
Go inside and rest.

51
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,275
- I’ll clean this up.
- I’m fine.

52
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,119
I can do this.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,479
You may leave.

54
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,075
Yes, Lord.

55
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,360
Miss,

56
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,520
let me go get

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,625
Princess’s measurements.

58
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,080
No need,

59
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,119
Aunt Su.

60
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,285

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
is in the style of Zhongzhou

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,000
with the stitch of Dazheng.

93
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,685
It’s well-made.

94
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,400

95
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
and the fabric is silky.

96
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,760
Thank you for your work.

97
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,479
It’s my honor, Princess.

98
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,600
I’m glad you like it.

99
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,520
I love it, really!

100
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,175
This is the first robe for my husband.

101
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,919
I’m sure Duohan

102
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,440
will like it.

103
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:53,475
May I ask why you chose

104
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,850
the style of Zhongzhou in particular?

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,479
The truth is

106
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,479
there’s this girl Duohan likes

107
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:03,039
back in Dazheng

108
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,000
who may never

109
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,119
be able to come here.

110
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,000
I often see him looking into

111
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,575
the direction of Zhongzhou,

112
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,960
alone and frowning.

113
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,760
That just pains me.

114
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,359
I want to cheer him up

115
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,440
but there’s little I can do.

116
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:24,960
Now,

117
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,400
this underrobe will certainly

118
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:29,766
turn his frown upside down.

119
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,799
Thank you again.

120
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,856
Give my thanks to the embroiderer, too.

121

in Hanzhou for you to gallop across

130
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,280
will be your territory

131
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,250
and the place where sweet Tara is

132
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,840
will be your home!

133
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,125

- Come.
- Sit with each other.

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,375
No, no, no.

155
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,080
- We want
- Yes!

156
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,359
- Agreed!
- a little prince.

157
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,000
He’ll become

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,640
an eagle just like his father!

159
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,479
- Absolutely!
- Of course.

160
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:31,325
- Like father, like son.
- That’s right!

Yes.

163

Guys,

164
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,359
let’s give

165
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:39,080
the newly-weds some space

166
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,625
so that they can enjoy their night.

167
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,200
Let’s go.

168
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,700
- Sure.
- Let’s go.

169
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,359
Come on.

170
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:46,000
Let’s go drinking.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,119
Come on. Let’s drink.

00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:47,919
Congratulations!

00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,520
Let’s go.

174
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,320
Duohan,

175
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,280
I’ve prepared an underrobe

176
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,479
in the style of Zhongzhou.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Do you like it?

178
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,559
I do.

179
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,320
You know,

180
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
I looked everywhere

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
to have it tailor-made for you.

182
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,239
Tara,

183
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,324
the day-long wedding ceremony

184
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,770
is finally over.

185
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,136
You should get some rest.

186
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,641
Duohan!

187
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:20,875
Fang Zhuoying kicked Duoluo

188
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
out of Lanzi

189
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,761
and married
Lord of Right Pudun’s daughter!

190
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,840
He’s now

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,119
a tough nut to crack in Hanzhou.

192
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,429
The Right Tribe and Jiaman are allies.

193
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,359
Is Lord of Left Pudun still able to

194
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,159
assist you, Your Highness?

195
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,000
There’s still time before summer.

196
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,000
Duoluo won’t give up

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,100
so soon.

198
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,599
It’s still

199
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,880
anyone’s game.

200
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,119
Your Majesty,

201
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,225
Tribes in Leizhou have sent envoys

202
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,000
after invitations arrived.

203
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,599
Right now, they’ve entered

204
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,359
the Chuliao Sea

205
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,450
and will soon reach

206
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,950
our southwest ports.

207
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,975
Drought there is barely over.

208
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,159
To reinforce security

209
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,239
for the sake of the envoys

210
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,400
and our own people,

211
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:18,294
I’m dispatching

212
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,875
100,000 troops from the capital

213
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,400
to the southwest.

214
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,950
- 100,000?
- 100,000?

215
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,950
Your Majesty,

216
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,200
with fewer troops

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,799
and defense lacking,

218
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,025
if anyone attacked us,

219
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,750
the capital would be in grave peril.

220
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Sending away over half of the force

221
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,239
to the southwest is too big a risk.

222
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,580
I strongly advise against that.

223
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,520
You think I don’t know

224
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,479
it’s not exactly ideal

225
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,119
to pull away the force here?

226
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,574
But the southwest has just
finished recruiting.

227
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,510
It’s impractical

228
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,540
to have local governments

229
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,544
recruit and train more soldiers.

230
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
Your Majesty,

231
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,960
the capital is the heart of our nation.

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,725
It can’t be left unguarded

233
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,450
for your safety.

234
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,159
Huangquan Pass has enough troops.

235
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,000
We can relocate

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,880
some of them

237
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,919
to the southwest.

238
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,960
They’re

239
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,880
too far away.

240
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,119
The southwest needs immediate help

241
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,075
that Huangquan Battalion

242
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,400
cannot provide.

243
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,559
I won’t allow it.

244
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,919
Your Majesty,

245
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,275
think about the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

246
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,119
He took advantage of the weak defense

247
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,039
and raided the capital

248
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,159
back in the day.

249
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,760
We can’t make
the same mistake, Your Majesty.

250
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,550
Lord Qinghai,

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,200
what’s your opinion?

252
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,000
Your Majesty,

253
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,919
I agree with you.

254
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,599
Given the situation in the southwest,

255
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,556
100,000 troops

256
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,799
can be stationed in Xiping Port.

257
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:54,200
Meanwhile,

258
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,640
Your Majesty,

259
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,599
call back 50,000 troops

260
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,880
from Huangquan Battalion to Tianqi.

261
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,000
Left General’s Mansion

262
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,640
can help with the transition

263
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,679
to regroup the guards

264
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,400
and leave no loopholes.

265
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,200
Granted.

266
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,719
Left General’s Mansion
is to protect His Majesty.

267
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,679
How can we do our job

268
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:23,440
with half of the force gone?

269
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,650
That’s right.

270
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,719
The southwest border can’t be lost

271
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,280
but the security of Tianqi

272
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,559
remains a top priority.

273
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,159
Even if we have 50,000

274
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,159
Huangquan troops back,

275
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
they don’t

276
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,559
know the city

277
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,159
as well as our own members.

278
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,359
Lord,

279
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,440
tribes in Leizhou

280
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,075
worship Dragon Tail.

281
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,440
If Madam Pearl

282
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,475
can bring Dragon Tail

283
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:48,700
to Tianqi,

284
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,000
they’ll

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
fall in line automatically

286
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,559
and our troops can stay where they are.

287
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,600
Speaking of which,

288
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,750
it’s been days since His Majesty

289
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,599
sent invitations to those tribes.

290
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,559
Why hasn’t Madam Pearl left

291
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,560
to bring Dragon Tail back?

292
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,199
Whether

293
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,439
she can do it or not,

294
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,680
our defense at the southwest

295
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
must stay tight.

296
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,300
If the merfolk

297
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,400
failed to bring those tribes to heel

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,925
and they insisted on

299
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,319
attacking the southwest,

300
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,160
then what?

301
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,239
- Uh...
- Well...

302
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:29,800
General He, General Yu.

303
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,359
- Yes, Lord.
- Yes, Lord.

304
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,680
Follow His Majesty’s order

305
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,119
and deploy 100,000 troops

306
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,640
to Xiping Port.

307
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
Go get ready. No delay is allowed.

308
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,975
- Yes.
- Yes.

309
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,875
With 100,000 troops away,

310
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,040
the safety of Tianqi is undermined.

311
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
Defense along the passes outside

312
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,959
need to be rearranged.

313
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:04,719
Your Highness,

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,925
Lord is at Left General’s Mansion

315
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,175
and won’t be back soon.

316
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
You can come some other day.

317
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:10,199
That’s fine.

318
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,319
I’ll wait.

319
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,925
You may leave.

320
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,925
Don’t worry about me.

321
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:17,850
Yuran,

322
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,199
go with him.

323
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,559
I’d like some space.

324
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:22,920
- Yes.
- Yes,

325
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,680
Your Highness.

326
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,479
Such luster

327
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,380
is unique to luminous pearl powder.

328
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,239
What does Master need this for?

329
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:36,185
How are you doing, Mr. Puyouma?

330
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,230
Mr. Bonen Naji.

331
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,650
I’m bored to death

332
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,520
over the past few days in Tianqi.

333
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,000
There are eyes and ears everywhere.

334
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,641
I can’t even get out.

335
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:52,560
I understand.

336
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,239
This so-called protection

337
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,920
by the Emperor of Dazheng

338
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:58,680
is more like

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,040
surveillance.

340
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:01,900
Um.

341
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,239
Mr. Bonen Naji,

342
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,680
I heard

343
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
they have this place in town,

344
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,560
called Huixian Restaurant,

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,040
which sells Three-horse Liquor
from Hanzhou

346
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,760
and the best Three Flower Spirits,

347
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,920
a specialty of Dazheng.

348
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,479
If so,

349
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,575
that place

350
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,760
would be perfect for drinking.

351
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,760
Sadly,

352
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,920
we’re stuck here

353
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,900
and unable to taste any drinks.

354
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,640
Keep it down.

355
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,160
Follow me.

356
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,150
(Envoys’ Residence)

357
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,280
Lord,

358
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,000
Consort Chunrong
has been waiting for you.

359
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,640
Didn’t you tell her

360
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,725
I was at Left General’s Mansion?

361
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,475
I did

362
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,359
and she said she’d wait.

363
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,760
Bring me the map.

364
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,575
Yes.

365
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Lord Qinghai.

366
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,500
Mhm.

367
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
I’m sorry

368
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,359
to have kept you waiting.

369
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,439
Don’t be.

370
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,520
I was reading your books about Leizhou.

371
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,880
You have a full collection.

372
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,280
You must be surprised

373
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,599
that I came back so quickly.

374
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,775
I am.

375
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:32,920
I wouldn’t have

376
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,960
been so thick-skinned before,

377
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,319
then it occurred to me

378
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,560
that you once said,

379
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,875
“With great power

380
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,439
comes with great responsibility.”

381
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,959
I’m empowered by the public

382
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,280
as Madam Pearl

383
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,319
and it’s my responsibility

384
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,239
to protect them

385
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,599
from Leizhou.

386
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,520
What you say

387
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:56,726
or do to me

388
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,719
shouldn’t distract me

389
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,160
from doing the right thing.

390
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,350
So,

391
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,079
whatever concerns you have,

392
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,319
I’m here regardless.

393
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,455
I see.

394
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,341
You have a point.

395
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,225
Master,

396
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,719
I’m told that

397
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,680
those envoys’ ships have left Leizhou

398
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,199
for the East Land,

399
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,600
and they are escorted

400
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,250
by their navies.

401
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,050
We lack defense at sea

402
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,439
against those fleets at full speed.

403
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,880
I’m going to ask for
His Majesty’s permission

404
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,400
to lobby them.

405
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,800
Right now,

406
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:42,250
if someone intends to trigger a war,

407
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,920
all they need is a dead envoy

408
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,250
to play Dazheng

409
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,520
and Leizhou off against each other.

410
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:49,640
I’m thinking...

411
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,280
Lord!

412
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:55,950
Your Highness,

413
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:56,920
Lord.

414
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,400
What’s wrong?

415
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,350
Mr. Puyouma and Mr. Bonen Naji

416
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,959
went missing.

417
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:01,239
What?

418
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,719
I’ll have men search the entire city.

419
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,520
Wait.

420
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,599
Keep it quiet.

421
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Ask Secret Force

422
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,520
to follow the trace and tread carefully.

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,079
Yes, Lord.

424
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,475
Enjoy your liquor.

425
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:26,040
I can’t use chopsticks.

426
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,560
Huixian Restaurant

427
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,439
is as good as you say.

428
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,319
Hey,

429
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,425
cheers!

430
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,640
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

431
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,650
Coming.

432
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,475
I’d like some beef.

433
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:41,675
Here’s your beef.

434
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,239
Refill.

435
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
No, wait,

436
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,800
hold on.

437
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,839
I need to...

438
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:01,693
Give us some beef.

439
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:02,750
Enjoy your beef.

440
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,880
Take a leak.

441
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,975
Sure.

442
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,640
The latrine is in the backyard.

443
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,000
Go, go, go.

444
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,560
I’ll be right back.

445
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:15,880
Go ahead.

446
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:20,640
Be careful.

447
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,979
Watch your step.

448
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,747
Enjoy your food.

449
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,040
Welcome, Mr. Puyouma.

450
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,680
Lord Chang has prepared

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
desserts from Zhunian

452
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,200
to give you a taste of home.

453
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,119
Sneak Bonen Naji

454
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,400
out of the Envoys’ Residence

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,119
to Huixian Restaurant.

456
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,430
Where’s the latrine?

457
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,040
It’s pitch dark.

458
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
Who is it?

459
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:41,404
Mr. Puyouma.

460
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,680
Jifeng Pavilion?

461
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,876
Take a seat, officers.

462
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,400
My treat.

463
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,640
No, thanks.

464
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,560
We’re on duty.

465
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,079
Where’s Mr. Bonen Naji?

466
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,599
I didn’t see him.

467
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,040
I don’t know.

468
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,125
This is an emergency.

469
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,439
We’re ordered to protect you two.

470
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,075
Please tell me

471
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,875
where

472
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,640
Mr. Bonen Naji is

473
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,760
for your own sake.

474
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,640
My poor memory!

475
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,280
I remember it.

476
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,334
He was drunk and got out.

477
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,920
I think

478
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,520
he... he went that way.

479
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,839
Over there.

480
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
Help!

481
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,150
Help!

482
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,000
Help!

483
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,439
Mr. Bonen Naji!

484
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,160
Get him out!

485
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,400
Help!

486
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Please stop, Your Highness.

487
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,640
His Majesty says

488
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
no entry into Yu’an Palace.

489
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,319
It’s urgent.

490
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
Time is pressing.

491
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
His Majesty has given me

492
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,920
free access to this place.

493
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:10,959
Those Imperial Guards

494
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:11,920
are inflexible!

495
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:12,950
Don’t they understand

496
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,000
how important Bonen Naji’s matter is?

497
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,040
Pass my order.

498
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,800
Let me know

499
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,920
whenever Consort Chunrong

500
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,000
asks to see me.

501
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,800
No one shall stop her.

502
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

503
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,760
Where’s Jianming?

504
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,920
Lord Qinghai and members of
the Ministry of Rites

505
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,680
are waiting at Jingcheng Hall.

506
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:27,640
Let’s go.

507
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,239
Don’t wait up.

508
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,375
Eunuch Mu will

509
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,550
bring His Majesty back once it’s over.

510
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,839
It’s dark outside.

511
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,359
Be careful on your way back.

512
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:39,425
Sure.

513
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,719
Your Highness...

514
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,680
Let’s get ready

515
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,920
for bed.

516
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,400
Haishi only said that to comfort me.

517
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:52,760
His Majesty will be

518
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:54,650
too busy to come back tonight.

519
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:57,359
Consort Chunrong barged in this late

520
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,839
and dragged His Majesty out so easily...

521
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,560
Bizi,

522
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,550
I’ve warned you more than once

523
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,025
to stop saying that.

524
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:10,477
(Virtue Brings Real Aroma)

525
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,680
Will he wake up?

526
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,160
Your Majesty,

527
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,920
he had stopped breathing.

528
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,800
Without Commander Chen’s treatment

529
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,160
and the life-saving pill,

530
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,839
he wouldn’t have made it here.

531
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,119
Right now, he’s stable

532
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,275
but it might take

533
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,359
a few days

534
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:37,560
or months for him to wake up.

535
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,350
You may leave.

536
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,175
Yes.

537
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,280
Your Majesty,

538
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,000
this isn’t an accident.

539
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
Puyouma and Bonen Naji

540
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,479
changed their clothes

541
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:53,034
and sneaked out to drink.

542
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,479
But those assassins

543
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,680
knew exactly where they were.

544
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,079
They were professionals

545
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,520
and didn’t leave any trace behind.

546
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,350
Someone

547
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,880
is trying to kill Bonen Naji

548
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,050
to turn Nihualuo

549
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,770
against Dazheng.

550
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,599
If that’s the case,

551
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,775
even if he’s still alive,

552
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,575
Nihualuo won’t let this slide.

553
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,760
I need you two

554
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,520
to work with me tomorrow

555
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,450
to churn the waters.

556
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,119
Your Majesty,

557
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:24,820
Mr. Bonen Naji

558
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,199
is Nihualuo’s special envoy

559
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,199
who was attacked by assassins

560
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,650
in your capital

561
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,660
and went missing.

562
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,599
I’ve sent

563
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,719
the message back home.

564
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,520
We demand

565
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,186
a proper explanation

566
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:42,214
or Nihualuo will declare war on Dazheng

567
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,511
at all costs!

568
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,280
Your Majesty,

569
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,050
I know

570
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,250
I’ve offended you

571
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,005
just like

572
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,880
Mr. Bonen Naji.

573
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:57,719
Now that

574
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,300
he’s dead,

575
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,920
just do

576
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
what you have to do to me.

577
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,640
Do what I have to do?

578
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,359
I’ve made no enemies in Dazheng.

579
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,130
Who else

580
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,425
would’ve sent the assassins?

581
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,560
If you didn’t do it,

582
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,079
hand over those who did

583
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,239
to uphold justice.

584
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,359
Fine.

585
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,479
I’ll do what I have to do.

586
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,599
Uh...

587
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,075
Lord Qinghai,

588
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,800
fill the two envoys and the others in

589
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,719
on the investigation

590
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,325
into last night’s case.

591
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:36,850
Yes.

592
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,640
Envoys’ Residence

593
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:48,920
is heavily guarded

594
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,600
for the safety

595
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,479
of all the envoys.

596
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:56,599
They can’t get out

597
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,959
without permission according to our law.

598
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,040
Last night, Puyouma

599
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:05,160
talked Mr. Bonen Naji

600
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,359
into bypassing security

601
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,959
and sneaking out

602
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,924
to drink at Huixian Restaurant.

603
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,760
When Mr. Bonen Naji

604
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,599
became too drunk

605
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,439
to think,

606
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,205
Puyouma directed him

607
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
to the dark backyard

608
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:23,806
where assassins were waiting for him.

609
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,359
As Zhunian’s special envoy,

610
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,719
Puyouma is sneaky

611
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,520
and suspicious.

612
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,479
Dazheng isn’t responsible

613
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,640
for the assassination,

614
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,239
but he is.

615
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,760
Nonsense!

616
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,581
Someone at Huixian Restaurant

617
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,875
saw you pointing to the backyard.

618
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
We also have witnesses to prove

619
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,719
you stole two suits from servants.

620
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:48,175
I was showing him

621
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,725
the way to the latrine.

622
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,359
Besides,

623
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,520
he forced me to drink with him

624
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,479
at Huixian Restaurant.

625
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,561
Nonsense!

626
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,959
As much as he loved drinking,

627
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680
he could drink at Envoy’s Residence.

628
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,160
Why would he force you to get him out?

629
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,700
He wanted to taste Hanzhou’s liquor

630
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,375
but there was none inside.

631
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,425
No way!

632
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,560
Our envoy

633
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,040
would never break the law on drinking!

634
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,199
You’re to blame!

635
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,125
Enough.

636
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,880
It’s your word against his.

637
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,025
We still don’t know the truth.

638
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,640
Once

639
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,825
Bonen Naji wakes up,

640
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,450
we can ask him.

641
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,500
Are you surprised?

642
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,839
You bought those rumors

643
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,119
but I never said he’s dead.

644
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,319
Impossible!

645
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,599
I heard he had stopped breathing

646
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,839
when they got him out.

647
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,479
That’s true.

648
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:46,365
No one could bring him back to life

649
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,479
except for

650
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,239
Dragon Tail’s envoy,

651
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,075
Madam Pearl.

652
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,060
Last night,

653
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,119
Mr. Bonen Naji was

654
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,160
in a critical condition.

655
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,800
Luckily,

656
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,359
he believes in Dragon Tail.

657
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:05,045
I prayed for him all night

658
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,599
and now,

659
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,455
he’s stable

660
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,399
but weak due to the drowning.

661
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,639
He’s resting

662
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,000
in Zhaoming Palace as we speak.

663
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,040
If he’s there,

664
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,125
may I go check on him?

665
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Of course.

666
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,870
Any time, Deputy Envoy.

667
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,240
I’ll lead the way.

668
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,760
That’d be great.

669
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,760
Thank you, Madam Pearl.

670
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,725
Rise.

671
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,880
Dazheng and Nihualuo

672
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,919
share the same root.

673
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,360
We’ll do everything we can

674
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,800
to ensure every envoy’s safety.

675
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:39,840
Your Majesty,

676
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:42,075
Puyouma is the prime suspect

677
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,886
of Mr. Bonen Naji’s assassination

678
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:46,996
and he violated the law of Dazheng.

679
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,930
We should have him detained
for further investigation

680
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,131
and inform Zhunian

681
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,959
to send a new special envoy.

682
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,025
I’m innocent!

683
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,650
I didn’t do it!

684
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:00,500
Lord Chang,

685
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:02,025
help!

686
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,120
Help me!

687
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,159
I’d never do such things!

688
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,080
Your Majesty,

689
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,239
as suspicious as Mr. Puyouma seems,

690
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:17,959
we still lack

691
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,679
solid evidence

692
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,120
to convict him.

693
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,239
Besides,

694
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,370
he represents Zhunian after all.

695
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,719
We’d better not

696
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:27,159
wrong their envoy.

697
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,645
Jichang,

698
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,360
what do you suggest?

699
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,919
In my humble opinion,

700
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,159
he can be

701
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,719
confined to

702
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,560
the Envoys’ Residence for now

703
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,580
with no contact from the outside.

704
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,639
Once

705
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,975
Mr. Bonen Naji wakes up,

706
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,449
we can have them confront each other.

707
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,120
Fine.

708
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,050
But he can no longer be the envoy.

709
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,346
Zhunian still needs to send a new one.

710
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,250
Yes.

711
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,439
Thank you, Your Majesty.

712
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

713
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,159
Your Majesty,

714
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,399
I have a piece of advice.

715
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,080
What is it?

716
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:09,560
Those tribes’ envoys

717
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,679
will soon arrive in Tianqi.

718
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,159
There will be all kinds of people.

719
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,775
To ensure their safety,

720
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,000
I recommend

721
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,760
tighter security
at the Envoys’ Residence

722
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,840
when summer is approaching.

723
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,175
Yes.

724
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,750
I agree.

725
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:25,486
Who should be in charge?

726
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:28,360
Your Majesty,

727
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,350
Lord Chang stayed in Zhunian for years

728
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,405
and he’s well-aware of
the customs in Leizhou.

729
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:39,185
I believe he’s the best fit

730
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:41,185
to take charge of security there.

731
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:43,700
I see.

732
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,189
Jichang.

733
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:46,975
Um?

734
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:48,865
Can you do it?

735
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,639
I finally have the chance

736
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,825
to serve the state.

737
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,225
I’m honored to do it

738
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,320
and I’ll do my best to keep the envoys

739
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:02,055
happy and safe.

740
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,080
Granted.

741
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,300
You think you’ve got me?

742
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,879
Your Highness...

743
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:18,544
Send the message to him.

744
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,630
The seed he planted

745
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:24,100
can bloom.

746
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,560
Yes.

747
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,510
Lord.

748
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,075
Welcome back.

749
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,479
You should’ve sent me

750
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,840
to rearrange guards

751
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,320
at the Envoy’s Residence for you.

752
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,159
I was there

753
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,399
to check Bonen Naji’s room

754
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,746
for possible leads.

755
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:45,540
Has anything turned up?

756
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,560
He’s well-connected.

757
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,650
He and Lord Chang went way back.

758
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,050
What’s our next step?

759
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,760
Watch Puyouma and Lord Chang closely.

760
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,639
I believe they’re behind this case.

761
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,750
Yes, Lord.

762
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,280
Lord,

763
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,199
Consort Chunrong

764
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,639
and Nihualuo’s Deputy Envoy

765
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,531
are inside with Bonen Naji.

766
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,479
Are you going in?

767
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,639
No.

768
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,320
Understood.

769
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Good day, Lord.

770
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,550
You can stop worrying

771
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,959
after seeing Mr. Bonen Naji yourself.

772
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,159
Yes.

773
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,014
He looks fine.

774
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,439
I wonder

775
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,120
when he’ll wake up.

776
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,919
He’s badly injured

777
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
and needs more time to recover.

778
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,040
Thank you for everything, Madam.

779
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,975
Once he gets better,

780
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,175
he’ll be back to the Envoy’s Residence.

781
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,100
Um.

782
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:57,080
Deputy Envoy!

783
00:38:58,825 --> 00:38:59,959
Deputy Envoy!

784
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,080
Deputy Envoy, are you alright?

785
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,399
Go get the physician!

786
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,075
Yes!

787
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,199
Master!

788
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:17,845
Master!

789
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:20,760
I won’t

790
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,975
let anyone lay a finger on you.

791
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:24,800
Master!

792
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,919
Master!

793
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:50,639
Your Majesty,

794
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,360
Lord Qinghai was stabbed in the arm.

795
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,479
His veins are fine

796
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,151
and the bleeding has stopped.

797
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,399
The wound isn’t too bad.

798
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,360
But why is he still in a coma?

799
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:01,479
Is it because of the poison?

800
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,560
His poison

801
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,520
isn’t acting up

802
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,800
because of the luminous pearl powder,

803
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,855
but the longer it’s there,

804
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,159
the weaker he becomes.

805
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,300
He’s much weaker than before,

806
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,111
which leads to his coma.

807
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:18,945
Not to worry, Your Majesty.

808
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,840
I’ll stay with him

809
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,360
and work on the treatment.

810
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,800
If nothing else happens,

811
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,650
he’ll soon wake up.

812
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,719
What poison?

813
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:31,985
What’s going on?

814
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,479
Follow me.

815
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,950
(Jincheng Palace)

816
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,534
