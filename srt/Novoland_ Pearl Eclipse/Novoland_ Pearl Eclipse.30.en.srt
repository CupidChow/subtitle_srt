25
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,039
Who are you?

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,399
Why did you collude with Su Ming

27
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,880
in assassinating His Majesty?

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,839
What’s your connection with

29
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,520
Lord Duoluo of Huku?

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,839
Tell us the mastermind

31
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,600
in exchange for your life.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,199
You’re Nie Ruoling. Your mother is

33
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,320
Commandery Prince Fenyang’s concubine.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,960
Your father Nie Jingwen

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,479
is the late emperor’s consort,
Nie’s younger brother

36
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,975
and Princess Yanling

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
and Lord Chang’s uncle.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
You and Princess Yanling are cousins,

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,960
which explains the resemblance

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
between you two.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
All that is true.

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,700
Kill me now.

43
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,456
I’m at your disposal.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
Your father and his whole clan

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,975
were executed due to his involvement

46
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,160
in the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
You had a narrow escape

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,039
and survived.

49
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,919
Why are you giving that up for revenge?

50
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:19,479
When did Su Ming

51
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,639
set you on to do this?

52
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,000
He set me on?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
I was simply

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,561
using his people and spy network.

55
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,360
Then who’s the one behind you?

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,941
Lord Duoluo of Huku?

57
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,675
You’ll never know.

58
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,160
He’ll kill you

59
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,100
to avenge my death someday!

60
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,005
You stole the throne!

61
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,400
Your succession is illegitimate!

62
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,880
You must pay for murdering my parents

63
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
and brothers!

64
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,759
Give me the name

65
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,750
and you can live.

66
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,520
Your Majesty!

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,680
I failed to kill you

68
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,839
but I’ll keep haunting you

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,480
after death

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,700
and make your life hell forever!

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,359
Search carefully.

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,559
If there’s anything on her

73
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,600
that leads to the spies,

74
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,679
let me know immediately.

75
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,226
Yes.

76
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,200
Eunuch Cui.

77
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:29,640
You...

78
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,760
You freaked me out!

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
Where are you going?

80
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,040
You can’t leave me behind.

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
You asked me

82
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,119
to tell you about His Majesty

83
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,279
and Lord Qinghai’s conversation.

84
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,325
You have to take me with you.

85
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,239
Lower your voice!

86
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:47,245
People don’t escape together.

87
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,279
You...

88
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:48,959
But...

89
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,399
Fine.

90
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:54,615
Come with me.

91
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:58,839
Let’s go!

92
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,480
Eunuch Cui,

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,720
what’s the rush?

94
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,725
Where to?

95
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,139
Mr. Fang.

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,079
I...

97
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,025
(Imperial Manufactories)

98
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,450
Uh...

99
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,239
I...

100
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,920
We...

101
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,519
Secretary Shi asked us

102
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,640
to purchase fabrics from the outside.

103
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:29,950
Purchase fabrics?

104
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,825
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,799
You’re fleeing to escape punishment.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,119
Take them away.

107
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,875
(Imperial Manufactories)

108
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,750
No...

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Eunuch Cui!

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,000
Secretary Shi!

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,559
Eunuch Cui!

112
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,799
Help, Secretary Shi!

113
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,000
Secretary Shi!

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,625
I’m so sorry, Your Majesty!

115
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,915
Your Majesty,

116
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:50,419
I was blind

117
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,450
and grossly negligent

118
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,475
in not knowing the spy in my office.

119
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,040
Even death couldn’t atone for my crime,

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
but please

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,119
spare me

122
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,500
for my dedication

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,920
and service,

124
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,025
Your Majesty!

125
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,480
I’ll go through

126
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,959
fire and water for you,

127
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,079
Your Majesty!

128
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,399
Shi Lin,

129
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,519
have you no shame?

130
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:21,600
I thought

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,559
you’d speak for me!

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,640
Yet here you are,

133
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,354
prostrating before an illegitimate ruler

134
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,109
and begging him for mercy!

135
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,655
Enough

136
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:33,440
of your nonsense!

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,079
Plead guilty now!

138
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,440
Confess

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,399
all your crimes

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,100
and you might be able to live!

141
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:46,514
Your Majesty!

142
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,359
Fine.

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,100
I’ll confess.

144
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,710
I did all that.

145
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,390
This eunuch

146
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:58,816
also worked for me!

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,679
Detain them

148
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,000
for interrogation.

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,425
Write down everything they say.

150
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,701
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,160
Spare me, Your Majesty!

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,040
Please!

153
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,850
Don’t do this!

154
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,000
Please, Your Majesty!

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,750
Your Majesty.

156
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:21,850
- Your Majesty!
- What...?

157
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,050
What will happen to me?

158
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,480
I swear I don’t know anything,

159
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,075
Your Majesty!

160
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:26,959
Get him out

161
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,825
and question him further.

162
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,320
Your Majesty!

163
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:33,359
Your Majesty!

164
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,200
I’m innocent!

165
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,075
Your Majesty!

166
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,799
I didn’t do anything!

167
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,280
Your Majesty!

168
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,950
Your Majesty,

169
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:00,760
Consort Shurong has waited

170
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,119
for hours at Jincheng Palace.

171
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,159
You may leave.

172
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,200
Consort Shurong

173
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,280
will stay the night here.

174
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,679
Why didn’t you

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,650
let me know you’re here?

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,599
The accident earlier

177
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,960
and the rebels

178
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,840
were a lot to handle.

179
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,880
I didn’t want to distract you

180
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,679
but I was worried,

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,280
so I came to

182
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,359
check with Eunuch Mu.

183
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,119
You’ve had a long day.

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Indeed.

185
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
I’m tired.

186
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,975
Talk to me now.

187
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,799
About what?

188
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,359
You can

189
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
walk me through

190
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,559
your day.

191
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,719
Haishi,

192
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:35,186
stop drinking. You’ve had enough.

193
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,159
I don’t get it.

194
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:41,159
Some people

195
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,605
sacrificed their own life so that

196
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,370
Commandery Princess Fenyang could live,

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,759
but why did she...?

198
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,730
Maybe

199
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,471
she found her mission

200
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,450
more important than life.

201
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,935
Are the lonely

202
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,045
and privileged ones on the top

203
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,415
all so hell-bent on their paths

204
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,361
that even those who love

205
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
and cherish them

206
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,559
can’t talk them

207
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,960
into taking a different one?

208
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,806
We all want different things.

209
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,246
For those above us,

210
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,000
they all have

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,159
an unshakable will

212
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,760
and the courage to sacrifice anything.

213
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:28,400
Because

214
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,719
they need to win

215
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,080
at all costs,

216
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,799
including the cost

217
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,245
of their own life.

218
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,280
Unshakable will?

219
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:42,300
That’s right.

220
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:01,479
Meaning

221
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,880
even if someone died in front of them,

222
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,164
they wouldn’t change their mind, right?

223
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,599
What’s outside the window?

224
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,475
Oh.

225
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,559
Just the bright moon.

226
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,764
(Huixian Restaurant)

227
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,110
Be careful.

228
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:53,479
Lord Qinghai.

229
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:55,960
I saw you waiting here

230
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,719
all night.

231
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,760
Sorry about that.

232
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,320
I’m here to take her home.

233
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
Fang Jianming, Fang Jianming,

234
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,039
Fang Jianming, Fang Jianming.

235
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,159
Fang Jianming,

236
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,640
would you treat me like you treat

237
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,960
Manager Ju
and Commandery Princess Fenyang?

238
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,119
No.

239
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,400
If I died in front of you,

240
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,520
would that get your attention?

241
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,580
No.

242
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,140
Yes!

243
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,679
No.

244
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:48,359
I won’t let you die.

245
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,320
Will you protect me

246
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,520
like you protect His Majesty?

247
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:52,880
Yes.

248
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,320
Liar!

249
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,825
You only care about him.

250
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:56,599
And

251
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:58,119
you’d do anything for him.

252
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,599
I pledged my life to him

253
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,385
but I’ll die for you

254
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,799
if I have to.

255
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,359
I don’t need your life.

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,440
All I’m asking is for you to be with me.

257
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,320
But you don’t like me.

258
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,719
You don’t like me.

259
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:57,960
How could I not?

260
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,159
You can’t imagine

261
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,729
how much you mean to me.

262
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,760
Master.

263
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,119
Master, you’re up!

264
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:47,835
Are you still in pain?

265
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,200
Master,

266
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,359
you’ve been in a coma for three days.

267
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:55,960
Slowly.

268
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:00,559
How come

269
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,599
you were so badly injured?

270
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,159
Why didn’t you say anything about it?

271
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,000
How’s...?

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,479
Everything is going well these days.

273
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,199
Zhuoying and Shaozi

274
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,239
have rooted out

275
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,475
all Su Ming’s spies

276
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:13,280
and his entire secret network

277
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,560
in the city.

278
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,160
They’ve been handed over

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,920
to Associate Justice Zong

280
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,160
for questioning, trial and sentencing.

281
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,239
Also,

282
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,000
His Majesty has made it public

283
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,119
that you helped quash the rebellion

284
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,125
and the murder of
Six Wing Generals is a frame-up.

285
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,760
Your name

286
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,700
has been cleared

287
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,239
and you’ve been reinstated.

288
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Zhuoying says

289
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,839
His Majesty’s edict

290
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,599
leads to a round of applause in court.

291
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,775
And storytellers

292
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,616
have been spreading your achievements.

293
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,580
Too bad, I didn’t get to hear it.

294
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:45,199
His Majesty has given you a sick leave

295
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,199
and tons of rewards, too.

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,280
I’ll go get your medicine.

297
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,119
Master,

298
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,550
stay in bed.

299
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:05,635
Young Master Haishi,

300
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,189
I’ve warned Lord

301
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,719
against more wounds.

302
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,199
Those new ones

303
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,359
and the poison from this time

304
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,175
are worsening his condition.

305
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,359
How much worse is it?

306
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,000
At this rate,

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,319
his death

308
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,880
is inevitable

309
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,325
in a few years.

310
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,000
Haishi.

311
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,599
Is Master awake?

312
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:34,375
Yes.

313
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,280
Perfect.

314
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:36,719
I have information for him.

315
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:37,439
Zhuoying.

316
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,160
Relax.

317
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,719
Master is strong.

318
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:41,615
After resting for a few days,

319
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:42,640
he’ll be fine.

320
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,479
He’s barely come out of a coma.

321
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,375
Don’t bother him with work.

322
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,064
I’ll go get his medicine.

323
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,000
How is he?

324
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:16,719
Your Majesty,

325
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,210
after a few days of acupuncture

326
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,704
to remove Lord Chang’s poison,

327
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,400
he’s stable now.

328
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,239
All he needs is more rest.

329
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,995
Take good care of him.

330
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:32,359
If anything happens to him,

331
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,680
I...

332
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,839
You have my word, Your Majesty.

333
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,359
I’ll look after him

334
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,280
day and night

335
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:41,746
until he makes a full recovery.

336
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,880
You may leave.

337
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,880
Yes,

338
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,439
Your Majesty.

339
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,239
Go away!

340
00:19:58,475 --> 00:19:59,900
You rebels!

341
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,640
Step back!

342
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,599
- Stay away from big brother!
- Jichang.

343
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,359
Jichang!

344
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,575
Another bad dream?

345
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,100
Big brother.

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,925
It’s fine.

347
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,079
Lie back.

348
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:15,599
Thank you, big brother.

349
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,439
I wanted

350
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,520
Mudan to gain happiness

351
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,280
and I was busy

352
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,335
preparing for her wedding.

353
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,359
I can’t believe

354
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,239
I got fooled

355
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,719
by a fake one

356
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,040
and almost got killed.

357
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,741
I was so stupid.

358
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,350
You realize that now?

359
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,880
Didn’t you know

360
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,160
you could’ve died

361
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,800
for saving me?

362
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,800
I didn’t think that much.

363
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,199
I was sent

364
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,160
to Zhunian when I was little

365
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:00,119
and I didn’t get to spend

366
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,839
too much time with you.

367
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,800
But

368
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,239
I always thought about

369
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,760
our time together

370
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
as kids.

371
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,839
Those old good days

372
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,945
made my life in Zhunian

373
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,094
seem less tough.

374
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:17,916
Jichang,

375
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,641
I’m sorry for your suffering.

376
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:29,479
I appreciate

377
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,160
all your effort

378
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:33,575
to get me back to Dazheng

379
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,625
and everything

380
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,230
you’ve done for me

381
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
since my return.

382
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,959
You treat me so well.

383
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,020
I should do the same in return.

384
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,599
To me,

385
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,800
your safety

386
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,760
matters the most.

387
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,531
I’d do anything to protect you.

388
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,250
You’re my only family left.

389
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,225
Promise me

390
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,880
that you won’t

391
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,040
take such a risk again.

392
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,599
Yes?

393
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,225
Yes.

394
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,000
I should go.

395
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,800
The physician says you need more rest.

396
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,050
Then stay away

397
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,479
from your eagles

398
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
for a while.

399
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:31,825
What?

400
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,319
Big brother,

401
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,190
they’re my babies.

402
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,800
Staying in bed all day

403
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,319
is boring.

404
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,334
Those eagles and shows

405
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,236
will cheer me up.

406
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:45,920
A good mood

407
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,959
may help

408
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,490
speed up my recovery.

409
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,680
Don’t you think so, big brother?

410
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Suit yourself.

411
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,160
Take care.

412
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,839
I will.

413
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,075
We got played by Emperor Xu

414
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:48,950
and Fang Jianming again,

415
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,780
which cost us our troops

416
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,640
as well as

417
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:56,315
Su Ming and assets in Tianqi City.

418
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,514
All of them are gone.

419
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,400
It’s my fault.

420
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,560
I shouldn’t have trusted Su Ming.

421
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,335
He was a citizen of Dazheng

422
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,119
unlike fierce and experienced warriors

423
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,079
of our own.

424
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,199
Given that he didn’t leave

425
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,834
with the crack troops,

426
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:14,319
our losses are manageable.

427
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,839
I have no choice

428
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,560
but to go there

429
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,540
and chop Fang Jianming

430
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,100
and Emperor Xu’s heads off myself.

431
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,894
Tianqi City is now under tight security.

432
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,760
If you show up,

433
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,370
you might play right into
Fang Jianming’s hands.

434
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,644
Don’t worry.

435
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:36,325
I won’t do anything rash.

436
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,725
We’ll rest for a few days

437
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,880
and then inform

438
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,040
my backup in the city.

439
00:24:43,225 --> 00:24:44,624
Just wait and see

440
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:48,599
how Fang Jianming and Emperor Xu

441
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:50,750
die in my hands.

442
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,119
We’ve found

443
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,200
tons of leads at Princess’s Mansion.

444
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,959
Su Ming’s hard-core followers and spies

445
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:57,959
have all been compromised.

446
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,640
The poisoned almond tea at Fabric Office

447
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,920
and the dead eunuch

448
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,280
are all Eunuch Cui’s doings.

449
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,850
He caved

450
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,345
too quickly.

451
00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:08,239
Are you saying...?

452
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,315
He might be covering for a big fish.

453
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,000
Understood.

454
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,680
I’ll dig deeper

455
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,439
to uncover

456
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,599
more leads.

457
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,079
Is there anything

458
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,959
tied to spies at Huangquan Pass?

459
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,789
Nothing at the moment.

460
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,439
Keep working on it.

461
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,200
Yes.

462
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,079
It’s time to take your medicine, Master.

463
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,680
Again?

464
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,800
The physician says so.

465
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,180
Just be good.

466
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:49,325
Hey...

467
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,719
Bonehead!

468
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:58,719
Pardon?

469
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,839
Nothing.

470
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,735
I mean you’re good.

471
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:03,959
Take this.

472
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:10,599
Master,

473
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,129
is everything smooth at Zhuoying’s end?

474
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,425
Yes.

475
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,000
I had a discussion

476
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,199
with him earlier about the case,

477
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,560
which didn’t answer all my questions.

478
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,319
His Majesty’s sudden edict

479
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,359
to find

480
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,599
imperial clansmen outside

481
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,359
was to lure

482
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,959
those rebels out.

483
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,479
Although Su Ming defected,

484
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,800
his secret network

485
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,719
and spies

486
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,719
remained in the dark

487
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,160
in Tianqi City.

488
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,920
That’s why you and His Majesty

489
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,160
set this trap together.

490
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:38,175
Correct.

491
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,825
When Mrs. Guchen framed you

492
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,719
for murdering Six Wing Generals,

493
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,199
it went all over the city overnight

494
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,079
because of Su Ming

495
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,119
so that

496
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,479
he could use Censor Duan

497
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,079
to deprive you of your military power.

498
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,079
Then you volunteered to stand down

499
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,119
to mislead Su Ming

500
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,119
into thinking

501
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,640
his scheme worked.

502
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,425
Right.

503
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,280
You became powerless,

504
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,630
but with so many guards in the palace,

505
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,790
including Secret Force
of Jifeng Pavilion,

506
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,435
Su Ming still stood no chance.

507
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,520
So he asked Commandery Princess Fenyang

508
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,760
to use her wedding

509
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,199
to lure His Majesty out to her mansion

510
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,280
for the assassination.

511
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,079
The wedding

512
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,560
was his best shot,

513
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,119
so he’d mobilize

514
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,700
his entire secret network

515
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,560
and all his spies in the city,

516
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,079
which gave you and His Majesty

517
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,800
the perfect opportunity

518
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,379
to make a clean sweep,
so you played along.

519
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,761
That’s about the whole story.

520
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,079
What else do you want to know?

521
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:33,719
How could you tell

522
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,239
she wasn’t the real princess?

523
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,000
She recognized the nanny,

524
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,760
not to mention that scar on her arm.

525
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,790
If she wasn’t her,

526
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,000
how come

527
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
she knew everything?

528
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,280
Commandery Prince Fenyang,
Nie Jingwen,

529
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,651
is the late emperor’s consort,
Nie’s younger brother,

530
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,560
so she is

531
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,040
Princess Yanling’s cousin

532
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,920
and spent a lot of time
in her aunt’s palace.

533
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,719
That’s why

534
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,680
she knew everything about Linlang,

535
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,121
including the smallest details.

536
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:06,040
Su Ming thought by forcing me
back to Liushang,

537
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,280
His Majesty and I

538
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,160
would lean on

539
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,079
that fake princess for help.

540
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,879
The truth is

541
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,260
that I was never nice to her.

542
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,119
Had it been

543
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,079
the real Princess Yanling,

544
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,800
she would’ve never asked to marry me.

545
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,810
You could copy

546
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,319
one’s looks and behaviors

547
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,620
but not the personality.

548
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,770
The more decisive evidence was...

549
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,479
So, Nanny Liu

550
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,839
is your secret asset.

551
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,599
The residue of the decoction

552
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,361
was examined by the imperial physician

553
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,479
who found that was for
the fake princess’s cough

554
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,640
induced by

555
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,079
her peony allergy.

556
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,880
Her allergy could be exposed any minute,

557
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,560
so they had to

558
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,500
quicken the pace.

559
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,920
When they were in haste,

560
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,800
they’d make mistakes.

561
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,000
You’re a genius, Master,

562
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
that you eliminated
Su Ming’s hard-core followers

563
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,719
and spies,

564
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,959
and eventually, killed him

565
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,959
along with

566
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,040
several trained members of Huku.

567
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,040
Master,

568
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,079
you must be tired

569
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,119
after telling me so much.

570
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,775
Lie down and rest now.

571
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,601
Your Majesty.

572
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,760
What brings you here?

573
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,181
I was on my way from Jingcheng Hall

574
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:25,050
to Jincheng Palace after work

575
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,750
and saw the lightning and thunder,

576
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,140
so I came to check on you.

577
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,359
You’re safe.

578
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,004
Lie down. I’m here with you.

579
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,079
Your Majesty,

580
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,900
did you do the same

581
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,040
to Zizan?

582
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,871
No.

583
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,145
She was bold.

584
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,074
Sometimes, I’d wonder

585
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,626
if she had any fear at all.

586
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,491
It’s dangerous up there.

587
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,400
Come down quickly.

588
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,040
It’s fine. It’s not that high.

589
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,959
Jianming, do me a favor.

590
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,000
Get her down.

591
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,800
Come down.

592
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,395
Come here.

593
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:04,160
Hold the ladder.

594
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,900
No way.

595
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:06,875
Come down.

596
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,550
Now.

597
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,839
It’s up!

598
00:32:12,475 --> 00:32:13,239
Make wishes now.

599
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,359
Let it go, Jianming.

600
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,160
Tilan,

601
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,959
believe it or not,

602
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:37,000
I never wanted to be an emperor.

603
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,300
I know.

604
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,275
I also know

605
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,749
Zizan’s biggest fear.

606
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,250
What would that be?

607
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,310
Your unhappiness.

608
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,581
She loved you with her heart and soul.

609
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,114
If you love someone,

610
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:06,366
you hope he or she will always be happy,

611
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:09,675
which was exactly

612
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:11,900
what she wanted for you.

613
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,920
Xu,

614
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,250
will those swallows

615
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,875
flying to the south

616
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,731
come back next year?

617
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,019
Yes.

618
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,130
Of course.

619
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,990
They will if you want them back.

620
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,850
What else do you want?

621
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,885
I want you to be happy,

622
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
and to enjoy

623
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,725
a lifetime of happiness.

624
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:46,284
I will.

Haishi.

656
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,881
Youdu. What are you doing here?

657
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,080
I requested

658
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,719
to see Lord Qinghai.

659
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:47,225
Oh.

660
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,320
By the way,

661
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,040
this is our most valuable herb,

662
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,959
thousand-year-old ginseng.

663
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,560
You can use it to make soup for him.

664
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,439
Master is right inside.

665
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,040
I see. See you.

666
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,175
See you.

667
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,719
Lord Qinghai.

668
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,639
Please have a seat.

669
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,239
Is there something

670
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,479
you wish to tell me?

671
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,879
Yes.

672
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
I like Haishi.

673
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,360
You’re saying that to the wrong person.

674
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:04,600
I can’t say it to her

675
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:06,800
because

676
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,800
she’s given

677
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
her entire heart to another man.

678
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:14,996
She can’t see me

679
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,469
or anyone else.

680
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:26,959
Lord Qinghai,

681
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,145
I’d move mountains

682
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,865
to reach her heart,

683
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,679
but even when she was with me,

684
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,399
she couldn’t take her mind off that man.

685
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,600
Because of him,

686
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,679
she grew fond of Jifeng Flower.

687
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,320
Because of him,

688
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,959
she worked hard to master archery.

689
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
She can’t even stand seeing him frown.

690
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,399
She’s worried about him every day.

691
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I thought

692
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,239
that man was a stone.

693
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:55,080
I said to myself,

694
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,120
if she believed

695
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,959
he was the right one,

696
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,239
I could wait.

697
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,450
Turns out,

698
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,840
he cared her so much

699
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,800
that he waited in the rain all night

700
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,199
shortly after he was poisoned

701
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,239
only to take her home.

702
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,251
Here I am today for an answer.

703
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
If you also love her,

704
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,935
why not be with her and make her happy?

705
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,211
Is your definition of happiness

706
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,360
to be with a dying man

707
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,220
who might leave her any second?

708
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,919
If he’s the only one

709
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
to make her happy,

710
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,360
then yes.

711
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,399
Have you ever considered

712
00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:51,120
what she truly wants?

713
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,320
You push her away

714
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,880
because you might not live long,

715
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:58,875
but to her,

716
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,560
even if she could be with you

717
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,840
for only one day,

718
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,375
that’d be enough.

719
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,879
You know her well.

720
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,059
She’s tough.

721
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,320
Lord Qinghai,

722
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,165
I’m giving her up

723
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,800
because I know I’ll lose.

724
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,900
Not to you

725
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,355
but to Haishi’s obsession

726
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:30,825
with you.

727
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,159
I just want her

728
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,525
to be happy every day.

729
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,639
You might be unable to
be with her forever,

730
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:43,959
but you can create a beautiful memory

731
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:44,850
together

732
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:47,320
while you still can

733
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,350
so that she’ll have something

734
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,800
to make the rest of her life meaningful.

735
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,479
Good day.

736
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,439
Madam,

737
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,280
let me get you some tea.

738
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:27,300
Thanks.

739
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,800
I’ve been too busy these days

740
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,719
to spend quality time with you.

741
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,959
Are you mad at me?

742
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,479
Is that Mr. Fang?

743
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,679
The mess in the city is over for now.

744
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,199
I’ve finally got time to see...

745
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,520
See these rabbits.

746
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,879
Are you two being good?

747
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:25,800
I worked day and night earlier

748
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:26,719
and had no time

749
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:27,700
to take care of them.

750
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:29,760
I thought they’d be strange to me,

751
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,840
but they weren’t.

752
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,150
How could they be?

753
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,919
You’re so nice to them.

754
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,719
They’d never forget you.

755
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:38,800
Speaking of which,

756
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:40,399
you were sewing

757
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,280
gowns for that fake princess

758
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,450
around the clock.

759
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:45,280
And she had help

760
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,850
inside Imperial Manufactories.

761
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,280
I was concerned

762
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,159
about your safety.

763
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,959
But now, everything is fine.

764
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,775
Peace has been restored.

765
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,639
Mr. Fang,

766
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:00,120
do you have all the evidence

767
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,760
of that fake princess and Eunuch Cui

768
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,800
colluding with Huku?

769
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:03,959
All the evidence has been sorted out

770
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,600
and filed.

771
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,600
Why ask

772
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,575
out of the blue?

773
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,080
May I

774
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,000
take a look

775
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,800
of those filed fabrics

776
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,360
embroidered with codes?

777
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:18,200
What for?

778
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,959
Just to double-check

779
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:23,800
in case we miss anything.

780
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,239
Miss Zheliu,

781
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,000
you’re increasingly like Master.

782
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,439
Not to worry.

783
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:31,159
I’ll get to the bottom

784
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,360
of those spies.

785
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,500
Just leave them to me.

786
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:39,080
