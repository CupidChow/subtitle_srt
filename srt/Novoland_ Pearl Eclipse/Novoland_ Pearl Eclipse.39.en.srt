25
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,880
Have you arranged everything?

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
Rest assured, Mr. Liu.

27
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,600
Refugees at the temples

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,759
and outside the prefect’s office

29
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,839
have all been relocated.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,039
Recently,

31
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,839
charity porridge has also

32
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,639
been replaced.

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,675
I promise Madam Pearl

34
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:32,920
will not find anything fishy.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,919
We filed the petition

36
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,039
in hope of getting relief.

37
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,325
However, what we get now
isn’t grain from Yuezhou

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
but Madam Pearl.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,925
She’s the one who shot

40
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,080
the late Lord of Left Pudun dead.

41
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,639
She’s a hard nut to crack.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,520
Mr. Liu,

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
you and I have been dealing with

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,199
inspectors from the capital for years.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,759
We’re both clear

46
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,800
that a woman

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,559
knows nothing about disaster relief.

48
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,100
It’s said that Madam Pearl

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,660
is a Fang of Liushang,

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,559
one of Lord Qinghai’s apprentices.

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,425
She was later presented to His Majesty.

52
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,850
It’s possible that she’s not the one

53
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,850
in charge of disaster relief.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
It’s just that

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
she needs the credit.

56
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,650
As we agreed,

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,550
let’s make sure she’s well-provided for,

58
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,119
and cottoned up.

59
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:20,919
In the end,

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,360
we’ll give her jewels and fine clothes.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,479
As long as she doesn’t see the refugees,

62
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,850
she won’t put it in mind.

63
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,880
When the grain

64
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,500
from Yuezhou arrives,

65
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,119
we just need to give her

66
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,279
a grand farewell ceremony.

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,279
I hope so, Mr. Baili.

68
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:37,880
Mr. Liu,

69
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,825
Madam Pearl’s convoy

70
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:39,639
will arrive soon.

71
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,425
(Jubei Town)

72
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,725
(Jubei Town)

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,590
- Welcome, Madam Pearl.
- Welcome, Madam Pearl.

74
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,759
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,100
Thank you, everyone.

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,099
I appreciate it.

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,160
It’s my duty.

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,920
Madam, you have had a long journey.

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,959
Please go to the inn and rest.

80
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,200
Later, I will give you a reception.

81
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,239
In this time of the disaster,

82
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,850
we’d better
avoid ceremonies of any kind.

83
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:30,125
Why don’t you just

84
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,440
tell me directly

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,119
the current situations
of each prefecture?

86
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,225
I would also like to go to the granaries

87
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,679
and the charity porridge sheds,

88
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,760
and see what I can do for the people.

89
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,359
Madam Pearl,

90
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,679
well,

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
the grain from Yuezhou
hasn’t arrived yet.

92
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,880
I’m afraid it’s not something

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,825
we can solve overnight.

94
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,040
Besides,

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,959
Madam, you had a long trip

96
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,119
and need rest.

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,121
Alright.

98
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,234
Who is this?

99
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,200
I’m the president of Xiping Port
Chamber of Commerce,

100
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,239
Baili Yuan.

101
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,799
You’re a Baili.

102
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,559
Are you from the Baili family
of Nanhuai, Wanzhou?

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Exactly.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,559
Madam, you’re knowledgeable.

105
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,015
Sadly, the Baili family has declined.

106
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
It hasn’t been mentioned of

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,900
for many years.

108
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,600
Both the Fangs and Bailis
are powerful families.

109
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,250
Naturally, I know of them.

110
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,371
For what it’s worth,

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
our forefathers

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,880
go back a long way.

113
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,040
Sure, yes.

114
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,325
My ancestors were indeed

115
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,175
related to the Fangs of Liushang.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,391
That’s a great honor.

117
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:37,950
Madam,

118
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,825
please.

119
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,440
Madam,

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,875
Xiping Port is a remote prefecture.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
We don’t have good wine or food

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
to offer.

123
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,200
I have to apologize.

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
I’d like to make a toast,

125
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,220
Madam.

126
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,679
To everlasting youth.

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
- To everlasting youth.
- To everlasting youth.

128
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,760
Mr. Liu, you’re too modest.

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Xiping Port is a place of great wealth

130
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,791
and great talent.

131
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,600
On my way here,

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,075
I found the natural views

133
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,200
are more beautiful

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,559
than those of the capital.

135
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,559
Madam,

136
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,640
you’re so kind.

137
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,880
As a member of the nobility,

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,875
you came on behalf of His Majesty

139
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,076
to inspect the disaster relief.

140
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,100
Both we and the people are
in awe of your grace,

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,225
and want to offer the best to you.

142
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,440
Though the banquet is poor,

143
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,425
Mr. Liu and the people

144
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:42,160
truly appreciate your kindness.

145
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,559
I hope you won’t mind.

146
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,550
I really appreciate

147
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
this banquet.

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,679
But now,

149
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,600
I have a request to make.

150
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,160
Madam, I will do my best

151
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,119
to see to all your needs.

152
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,125
I heard

153
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,920
you have the best operas here.

154
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
I’m bored during the day.

155
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,239
I don’t like to go out either.

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,880
If it’s convenient,

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,959
I’d like to invite a troupe to the inn

158
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,279
and relieve my boredom

159
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,000
with their performance.

160
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,839
I’ll arrange it for tomorrow.

161
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,760
Well,

162
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:22,279
another toast to Madam Pearl.

163
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,825
Thank you, Madam,

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,625
for coming with blessings

165
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,920
of fair weather and prosperity.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,325
I’ll drink to that.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,650
The pearls are really effective.

168
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,975
In a few days,

169
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,279
you can walk as usual.

170
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,875
The pearls can only remove

171
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,279
the poisoned blood,

172
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,440
but can’t cure me.

173
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,550
It only makes me

174
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,550
feel better for a few days.

175
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:05,175
Lord Qinghai...

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,959
I know my condition.

177
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,200
Greetings, Your Lordship.

178
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,600
Please rise, Eunuch Mu.

179
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,450
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,200
His Majesty has ordered the Food Office

181
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,600
to make some tonic food for you.

182
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,720
Please have some.

183
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,900
Then I’ll

184
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,720
leave it here.

185
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,786
Thank you, Eunuch Mu.

186
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,850
Mm-hmm.

187
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,525
Did anything happen in the palace

188
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,119
while I was unconscious?

189
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,250
Your Lordship,

190
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,375
everything is fine in the palace,

191
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,250
except that His Majesty

192
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,719
can’t come to visit often

193
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,280
in case the news that you were poisoned

194
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,679
goes out.

195
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,159
So His Majesty ordered me to come.

196
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,880
Your Majesty.

197
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,119
Lord Qinghai is here.

198
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,000
Your Majesty.

199
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:01,960
I thought I told you
to take a good rest.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
What are you doing here?

201
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:04,736
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

202
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,975
I’m much better now.

203
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,479
You do look better,

204
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,239
but not good enough for you
to move around.

205
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,359
Go back and rest.

206
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,400
Your Majesty,

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,280
when did Consort Chunrong
leave for Xiping Port?

208
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,119
Who is the big mouth and told you that?

209
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,159
When I was unconscious,

210
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,520
you whispered it in my ear.

211
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,520
Whenever it comes to her,

212
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,919
you’re tense.

213
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
She’s been gone a long time.

214
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,159
You can’t catch up,

215
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,359
or call her back.

216
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,440
Why does it have to be her?

217
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,840
Fang Haishi is a lot like you

218
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,320
when it comes to your duty to me.

219
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,799
She was quite self-righteous

220
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,320
when she learned that

221
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,159
she was recommended for disaster relief,

222
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
and insisted on setting an example.

223
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,919
Convinced by her thorough knowledge

224
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,239
of the southwestern disaster,

225
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,958
I granted her request.

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,239
Fang Haishi isn’t a caged canary.

227
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,520
She cannot be truly happy

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,679
until she soars to great heights.

229
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:22,950
Your Majesty,

230
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,320
I volunteer to assist in disaster relief

231
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,000
at Xiping Port.

232
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,919
Jianming.

233
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,280
Nobody knows better than you and me

234
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,080
about the situation in Xiping Port.

235
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
I know Xiping Port

236
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,575
is a tiger’s den now.

237
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,840
But you can’t afford to travel

238
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,840
in your condition.

239
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,719
To find a cure for the poison,

240
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,679
I could say that I have

241
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,799
worked my heart out.

242
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,320
You’re worried about Fang Haishi.

243
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,375
But what about your health?

244
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,640
How could you pay no heed

245
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,719
to what I’ve done for you?

246
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,039
I know you’re concerned.

247
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,880
But can you protect her

248
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,320
for the rest of her life?

249
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,159
What I’m trying to say is that

250
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,520
I think Fang Haishi

251
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:05,919
is a resolute

252
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,479
and clever girl.

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,039
She’ll be able to handle it herself.

254
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,960
Jianming,

255
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:19,425
it’s time

256
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:21,876
for you to let go.

257
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,129
Be careful, Your Highness.

258
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,791
What’s the situation now?

259
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,785
We’ve checked thoroughly.

260
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,050
There are indeed

261
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,880
a large number of people
gathered in Xiping Port.

262
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:01,599
The people around the inn

263
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,239
aren’t like local residents.

264
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
But it’s only natural

265
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
that local officials hide the truth

266
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,239
and report only the optimistic side.

267
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:12,925
I planned to visit the granaries

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,719
and the charity porridge sheds

269
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,320
to find the mystery

270
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,640
lurking in Xiping Port.

271
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,919
However,

272
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,359
they won’t allow me

273
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,760
to find it anytime soon.

274
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,520
Go get my clothes.

275
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,650
Yes.

276
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,700
Did you see it?

277
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,334
I told you.

278
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,550
Madam Pearl

279
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,150
is just a paper tiger.

280
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,320
Do you think a noble lady

281
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
who’s married to His Majesty

282
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,960
would care about

283
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,119
those refugees

284
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,719
in rags, Mr. Liu?

285
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,320
I guess even you and I

286
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,475
are nobodies to her.

287
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,919
All she wants are operas.

288
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,919
Even the dossiers you ordered

289
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,880
to be forged are useless.

290
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,111
You can put them away now.

291
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,320
The granaries and the porridge sheds…

292
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,440
Mr. Liu,

293
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,559
rest assured.

294
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,350
Just do as we agreed.

295
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,701
We fight fire with water.

296
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,359
Your Highness, are you sure?

297
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,320
Don’t call me Your Highness.

298
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,481
Madam is fine.

299
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,925
Yes.

300
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,239
Remember.

301
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,640
The people of Xiping Port

302
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,760
suffer a great deal from the drought.

303
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,799
So for the people’s sake,

304
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,880
I’ll pray for rain in my chamber.

305
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,125
I won’t stop praying

306
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,840
in my chamber

307
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,119
until the day it rains.

308
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,280
Make sure she shows up

309
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,599
by the window from time to time.

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,760
Stall them

311
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,239
as long as you can,

312
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,559
until I return for the best.

313
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,640
Yes.

314
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,559
Then I’ll go get
the Imperial Inspector’s Seal.

315
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,599
That’s not necessary.

316
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,960
Stay here and watch over this place.

317
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Madam.

318
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,760
Don’t worry.

319
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,320
Have you forgotten who I really am?

320
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,790
I’ll be fine.

321
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:21,599
Liu Changping

322
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,960
has been avoiding me.

323
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:24,119
There must be

324
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,359
something that cannot be told.

325
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,760
I’m going to find out.

326
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,919
Madam,

327
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,559
take care of yourself.

328
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:30,960
See you.

329
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,520
Get in line.

330
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,760
Next.

331
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,880
Take the porridge and go!

332
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,479
Don’t stand in the way.

333
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,425
Go, go, go!

334
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:40,919
Move!

335
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,760
Hurry up, hurry up!

336
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,640
Make it quick. Go!

337
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,200
Sir,

338
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,880
can I have more?

339
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,440
The porridge given out lately

340
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,760
is watery.

341
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,200
- Hurry up.
- In a few days,

342
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,640
- Hurry up!
- we’ll be too weak

343
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,640
to even walk.

344
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,275
Cut the nonsense.

345
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:52,975
Thank you.

346
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,440
You should be grateful you can still

347
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,280
have rice porridge these days.

348
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,559
You want to eat your fill?

349
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,359
- I’m telling you.
- Please give me more.

350
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,280
The prefect’s order.

351
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,679
Sir.

352
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,039
You’re not allowed
to gather in the city.

353
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Break it up,

354
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,280
or you will have floggings

355
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,300
instead of porridge.

356
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:08,550
Leave now!

357
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Sir, sir.

358
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,200
We don’t want rice porridge.

359
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:13,719
The brans

360
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,280
and fodders

361
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
a few days ago are fine by me,

362
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,280
as long as it fills our bellies.

363
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,159
Get lost.

364
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,840
No more nonsense.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,920
Get out of here!

366
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,175
Break it up!

367
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,080
Guo San’er!

368
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,000
Guo San’er!

369
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,775
Hey.

370
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,359
You’ve been driving

371
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:29,760
these people around all day.

372
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,799
I don’t think you’re a captain anymore.

373
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,700
You’re a pig keeper.

374
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,159
It’d be great if they were pigs.

375
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,679
We could have something good for dinner.

376
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,559
Let me tell you something.

377
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,479
I haven’t eaten meat

378
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,359
in months.

379
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,159
The fodder soup makes

380
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,395
my mouth bitter.

381
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
Even in a barren year,

382
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:46,239
the garrison of Xiping Port

383
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,520
can feed on their own provisions,

384
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,280
instead of the local grain supply.

385
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,840
They’re never short of food.

386
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,039
But from

387
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,119
what they’re saying,

388
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,719
it seems someone has withheld

389
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:57,850
the garrison’s rations.

390
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,320
Get up now!

391
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,159
- Move!
- Get up!

392
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,679
On your feet!

393
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,760
Get up! Get up!

394
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,479
On your feet, everyone!

395
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,440
- Sir!
- Leave now!

396
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,119
You’re trying to...

397
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,080
Get out!

398
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Get up and leave!

399
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,559
Don’t drive us out of the city.

400
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:06,960
Go!

401
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,119
In the city, we can get free porridge.

402
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,520
But out there, we’ll die.

403
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,775
Your luck is out.

404
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:11,440
Sir!

405
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,000
A Madam Pearl came out of nowhere.

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,599
Mercy!

407
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,950
If you die of starvation,

408
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,000
- you should know who leads to it.
- Go!

409
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,359
- Don’t come to me.
- I beg you, sirs.

410
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,479
Go to her.

411
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,400
Go!

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,679
Go, go, go!

413
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,200
Let’s go.

414
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:30,200
Miss,

415
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,580
where are we going?

416
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,559
Let’s seek shelter in the col up ahead

417
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,320
for a few days.

418
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,000
When Madam Pearl leaves,

419
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
we’ll try to get back to the city.

420
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,400
Oh.

421
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,280
Judging by what just happened,

422
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,280
I don’t think we’ll be able to go back.

423
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,599
Let’s rest in the col for a few days.

424
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,869
If we can’t go back to Xiping Port,

425
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,760
we’ll have to

426
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
go to Yuezhou

427
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,200
as the others did.

428
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:53,960
Can you stop

429
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,239
making negative remarks?

430
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,239
If we set foot on the trip,

431
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,599
can we make it there alive?

432
00:16:58,725 --> 00:16:59,425
Hey,

433
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:01,880
it’s not like I kicked you out.

434
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,719
Why are you taking it out on me?

435
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,025
Yu,

436
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,400
leave her alone.

437
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,199
Hua’s brother went missing.

438
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,259
Now that we’re driven out,

439
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,520
who knows

440
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,760
if they could meet again

441
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,359
later on?

442
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:33,075
Here.

443
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,719
Hua found these in the woods.

444
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:35,680
Have something to nibble.

445
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
I’m not hungry. Thanks.

446
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,680
It’s alright.

447
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Just take it.

448
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,800
Even if you’re not hungry now,

449
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,840
you’ll be tomorrow.

450
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,400
By then, there might not be any food.

451
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,880
Yuezhou is fertile.

452
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,280
I noticed

453
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,680
that lots of them are fleeing.

454
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,359
Why don’t we follow them?

455
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,160
You’re from a surrounding town too,
right?

456
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,500
Mm-hmm.

457
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,825
It’s been a long drought in Xiping Port.

458
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:58,959
Due to the crop failure,

459
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:00,000
there’s nothing

460
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,479
around left to eat.

461
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,239
Everyone wants to go to Yuezhou.

462
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,719
But how many of them

463
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,599
can make it to Yuezhou on foot?

464
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:07,760
Most of them

465
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,359
die on the way.

466
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,640
But

467
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,199
can we survive

468
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,839
if we stay in Xiping Port?

469
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
We could actually.

470
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,575
There were porridge sheds

471
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:18,800
in the east and west markets.

472
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,839
Though the porridge

473
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,959
in the morning and at night was made of

474
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,680
fodder, such as brans and oats,

475
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:25,319
it’s barely enough to keep us alive.

476
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,405
They fed you fodder?

477
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:29,040
What else do you think

478
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,119
we commoners could get?

479
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,675
Rice?

480
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,160
But,

481
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,319
isn’t there rice in the granaries

482
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,160
of Xiping Port?

483
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
The white rice

484
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,560
in the granaries

485
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,599
was sold secretly

486
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,880
by Liu Changping

487
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,175
and his men

488
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,475
to rich merchants

489
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,640
who own merchant fleets

490
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,000
before the situation worsened.

491
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,000
Things left in the granaries now

492
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,280
are piles of fodder.

493
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes, I heard that

494
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,275
even the garrison

495
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,599
has run out of rice.

496
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,000
But what he did

497
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,119
is a crime that could get him
and his family executed.

498
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,760
That’s why

499
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,275
we’re kicked out.

500
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,119
They say that Madam Pearl

501
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,359
is the messenger of Dragon Tail.

502
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,959
But she didn’t bring any grain.

503
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,599
Instead, she brought something worse.

504
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,775
To cover up their secret deal

505
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,119
that trades rice for fodder,

506
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,640
Liu Changping and those merchants

507
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,160
set up a few granaries

508
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
with the last rice they have

509
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,760
and replaced charity fodder soup

510
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,880
to rice porridge.

511
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,199
But it’s not enough
for so many refugees.

512
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,400
They don’t want Madam Pearl

513
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,439
to find the truth,

514
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,760
so we’re thrown out

515
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,119
of the city in groups.

516
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:43,475
(Jubei Town Inn)

517
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,880
Mr. Liu.

518
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,119
Stewardess Yu,

519
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,199
I come to give my regard to Madam Pearl.

520
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,800
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

521
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,319
Madam Pearl said

522
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,479
the people of Xiping Port have long been

523
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:18,439
suffering from the drought.

524
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,600
She’ll pray in her chamber

525
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,439
for rain for Xiping Port.

526
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,920
So no visitors.

527
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:24,625
Oh.

528
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,400
Madam said she wanted to watch operas.

529
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,280
I’ve arranged a troupe.

530
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,925
Shall I take them here

531
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:31,680
to perform for Madam Pearl?

532
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,520
It’s so kind of you, Mr. Liu.

533
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,560
But Madam has to

534
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,319
concentrate on the prayer.

535
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,900
Madam said,

536
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,119
she’s made a vow

537
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,359
that before it rains,

538
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,599
she will not leave the chamber.

539
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,800
The performance

540
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,640
doesn’t matter.

541
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,319
It can wait.

542
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,825
Well, I’ll have

543
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,900
some vegetarian dishes sent over later.

544
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,640
Madam has been locking herself in

545
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,599
since she came to Xiping Port.

546
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,800
I can’t forgive myself

547
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,479
for the inconvenience.

548
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:58,640
Mr. Liu,

549
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,680
as Stewardess Yu told you,

550
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,550
I have to concentrate on the prayer.

551
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
But you keep disturbing me.

552
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,800
It’s really annoying.

553
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,875
I know

554
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,880
you mean good.

555
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:10,920
I guess it’s not late

556
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,150
to enjoy the operas in a few days.

557
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,959
No.

558
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,599
Anything you want, Madam.

559
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,049
I’ll do my best to see to it.

560
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:20,656
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

561
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,486
I’ll take my leave.

562
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,239
Sir.

563
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:35,719
(Jubei Town Inn)

564
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:36,760
This Madam Pearl

565
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,280
is really good at this stuff.

566
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,825
I doubt she cares about
the disaster at all.

567
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:40,825
She’s doing this for fear

568
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,439
of His Majesty’s punishment.

569
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,075
If that’s the case,

570
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
I’d be relieved.

571
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,119
Sir, do you find

572
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,439
anything wrong?

573
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,839
Did you hear any difference

574
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:53,079
from her voice today?

575
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,359
It sounds like her,

576
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,845
but not exactly the same as before.

577
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:58,959
Sir,

578
00:21:59,025 --> 00:21:59,760
is the one

579
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,839
in the chamber a fake?

580
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,680
The real one has left the inn

581
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,479
to find out the truth in the city?

582
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,839
Have someone find it out

583
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,239
tonight.

584
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,479
Yes.

585
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,839
Madam,

586
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,079
you’ve been praying all day.

587
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,640
Have a cup of tea and rest.

588
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,040
Has he gone?

589
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,800
Madam,

590
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,079
no sign of him.

591
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,084
Any message from Yuezhou?

592
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,760
The grain ships haven’t left Yuezhou.

593
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,375
They haven’t?

594
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,160
But before we left, His Majesty said

595
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,199
relief from Yuezhou

596
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,479
was ready.

597
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,479
The Chamber of Commerce says
the sea is rough,

598
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,920
which is not safe for sailing.

599
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,800
But it is not the stormy season

600
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
on the sea.

601
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,479
They’re just trying to delay it.

602
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:40,839
Madam,

603
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,160
what should we do?

604
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:43,959
Shall we ask His Majesty for help?

605
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,239
It’s too late.

606
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:46,560
Go get a brush.

607
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,155
I’ll write a letter to Yuezhou.

608
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,280
Have you seen it clearly

609
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,199
that it was Madam Pearl in the chamber?

610
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, I have.

611
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,925
You may leave.

612
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,599
Yes.

613
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:03,839
Mr. Liu,

614
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,680
it’s good that she stays indoors.

615
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,339
It’s just that

616
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:09,075
the relief has long been late.

617
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,500
If she stays longer,

618
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,839
the last amount of rice we have

619
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,119
will run out soon.

620
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
Mr. Baili,

621
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,800
what do you think we should do?

622
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Since she said

623
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,640
she’s praying for rain in Xiping Port,

624
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,556
let’s work out something on that.

625
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,160
Madam,

626
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,520
will the grain ships sail off

627
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,320
when they get the message?

628
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,000
We have to wait.

629
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,439
For what?

630
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,466
The rain.

631
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,000
Your Majesty,

632
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,239
please permit me to go to Xiping Port

633
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,160
and assist in disaster relief.

634
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,199
You barely gain any strength.

635
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,375
Calm down.

636
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:00,880
I just heard

637
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,225
relief for Xiping Port

638
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,105
has been delayed.

639
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:04,160
Without grain,

640
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,225
there’ll be a riot.

641
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,760
In that case, Haishi...

642
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,839
Consort Chunrong will definitely not

643
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,640
use force against the refugees.

644
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,900
But the evildoers

645
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,800
might hurt her

646
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,959
in the disguise of the riot.

647
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,359
Please permit me

648
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:17,160
to set out to Xiping Port immediately.

649
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,719
I’ve granted all the help necessary

650
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,800
to Fang Haishi.

651
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,119
Besides, she’s agile

652
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,040
and flexible,

653
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,250
and knows the southwestern situation

654
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,925
better than we imagined.

655
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:26,680
I trust her.

656
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,920
No matter what happens,

657
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,959
she’ll find a solution.

658
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,359
If you’re still worried,

659
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,400
I’ll send more help

660
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,160
to her.

661
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,800
But you must stay in the capital

662
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,839
to recover.

663
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,134
This might be an acute crisis.

664
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,280
It’s concerning her life.

665
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,800
I don’t want to leave it to others.

666
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,079
The southwest is far away,

667
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,439
and the journey is rough.

668
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,680
What could you do there?

669
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,160
I know you’re worried about Fang Haishi.

670
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
But what’s more worrying

671
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is your health.

672
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,774
I know Your Majesty cares for me.

673
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:56,374
But I’m dying.

674
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,800
If I die

675
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,375
before she returns safely,

676
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,764
I wouldn’t

677
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,770
rest in peace.

678
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:12,319
Get up.

679
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,526
You’re so stubborn.

680
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,875
I know

681
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,250
no matter what I say,

682
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,719
I can’t change your mind.

683
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,464
You remain calm

684
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,500
in so many state crises.

685
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:32,839
But when it comes to her,

686
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,450
you become...

687
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,309
Fine, go.

688
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,839
I’ve ordered men to find more pearls.

689
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,359
Those we have now

690
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,319
have been ground into powder.

691
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,595
Take it with you.

692
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:56,400
Jianming,

694
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:58,599
remember.

695
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,160
I’m letting you go.

696
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:03,795
You must

697
00:27:04,975 --> 00:27:06,776
come back safe and sound.

698
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:10,000
Um.

699
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:20,400
Lord.

700
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,199
Lord Qinghai.

701
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,880
Have you assembled

702
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,920
a team to go to Yuezhou with me?

703
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,719
Yes, I have.

704
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:25,280
Keep urging the relief.

705
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,079
Is the team ready to leave?

706
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,400
Yes, it is.

707
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,199
Give my order.

708
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,160
Stay low

709
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,160
and go separate ways.

710
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,075
Um.

711
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,150
After I leave,

712
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,359
reinforce the security of the palace.

713
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,839
Double the guards.

714
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:37,880
Nobody should desert their posts.

715
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,439
After nightfall,

716
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,280
the palace gates must not be opened.

717
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,375
See to it.

718
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,959
Make no mistakes.

719
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,839
Yes, Lord.

720
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,680
Lord Qinghai,

721
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
here is the medicine.

722
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,920
I’ve made it pills for your journey.

723
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,160
And,

724
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:06,839
this is the last pearl powder.

725
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,680
That’s all that’s left.

726
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,839
You have to

727
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,160
take the right dosage on time,

728
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,800
and return as soon as possible.

729
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,825
Otherwise...

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,520
Thank you.

731
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,719
I’ll try my best to.

732
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,199
Lord Qinghai,

733
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:19,560
come back as soon as possible.

734
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,760
What?

735
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,880
Fang Jianming left the capital?

736
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,195
There’s no doubt
that it is Fang Jianming.

737
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,425
Judging by the direction,

738
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,359
he’s heading to Xiping Port.

739
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,121
Smart man.

740
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,575
He saw through my plan.

741
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,079
Sadly,

742
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,269
the southwest is too far away.

743
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,119
It’s too late for him

744
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,889
to save Fang Haishi.

745
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,000
- More, please.
- Sir.

746
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,640
Thank you.

747
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,275
There’s barely any rice in it.

748
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,719
I don’t dream to eat my fill.

749
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:00,640
But it’s not even enough

750
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,719
to nibble.

751
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,239
Eat whatever you can.

752
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,479
Let me tell you.

753
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,719
Though Madam Pearl came,

754
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
we haven’t seen

755
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
a single sign of rice from Yuezhou.

756
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
If we don’t skimp,

757
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,160
we might die before relief arrives.

758
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,199
Get out! Go, go!

759
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,359
Let’s go.

760
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,239
What’s this?

761
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,319
There’s not a single grain of rice.

762
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,359
It’s like water.

763
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,280
We’ll starve to death sooner or later.

764
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,800
Yes.

765
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,680
We can’t get enough to eat every day.

766
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,599
Isn’t Madam Pearl here

767
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,150
for disaster relief?

768
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,800
Where’s the rice?

769
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,475
That’s right.

770
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,425
Since she came,

771
00:29:29,425 --> 00:29:31,079
the situation has gotten worse.

772
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:31,680
Well,

773
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,479
how absurd it is!

774
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,680
She never showed up

775
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,599
at the porridge sheds.

776
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:36,839
What’s she doing here?

777
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,079
What’s all this bickering?

778
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,280
Madam Pearl has no time

779
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,319
to worry about your lives.

780
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,160
She’s busy praying for rain every day.

781
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,160
Praying for rain?

782
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:47,716
Praying for rain?

783
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:49,479
It doesn’t rain at all.

784
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,750
Madam Pearl met an immortal
when she was a child?

785
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,119
- It’s all a lie.
- Hurry up!

786
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,025
Maybe because she lied
about meeting an immortal.

787
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,520
In a few days,

788
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,450
- Madam Pearl will have no choice
- The drought fell upon us.

789
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,040
- Right.
- Yes.

790
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,319
- but to leave Xiping Port.
- That’s right.

791
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,350
That’s how it should be.

792
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,000
Let’s hope so.

793
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,825
Thank you.

794
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,280
Stewardess Yu,

795
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,479
it’s been a long time

796
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,079
since the refugees had any food.

797
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,479
That’s why they’re

798
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,000
blaming Madam Pearl for it.

799
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,439
We can hold the refugees

800
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,839
on this street back.

801
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,775
But if more come to protest,

802
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,479
I’m afraid Madam will be in danger.

803
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,680
Why doesn’t

804
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,800
Madam Pearl leave Xiping Port
for a while?

805
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,719
Once the relief arrives,

806
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:26,959
she can come back.

807
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,079
Mr. Liu,

808
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,640
Madam is chanting sutras.

809
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,800
She can’t move.

810
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,280
The refugees’ rage is hard to contain.

811
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,560
If any danger falls upon her,

812
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,250
I don’t know
how to explain to His Majesty.

813
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,880
Yes, Stewardess Yu.

814
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,680
You can’t risk her life.

815
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,319
Madam has made a vow

816
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,959
that she won’t leave

817
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,040
until it rains.

818
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,150
It hasn’t rained in months.

819
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,959
Even though Madam Pearl

820
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:49,959
met Dragon Tail,

821
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,119
she may not be able

822
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,119
to make rain.

823
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,175
You’d better...

824
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:54,800
Oh.

825
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,359
- It...
- It...

826
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,359
It’s working.

827
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,839
It’s going to rain.

828
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,839
Is it going to rain?

829
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,439
Oh.

830
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,000
It’s raining!

831
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,719
It’s raining!

832
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,439
It’s raining!

833
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,950
It’s raining!

834
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,000
It’s really raining!

835
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,125
It’s raining! It’s raining!

836
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,199
Thank god!

837
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,640
It’s raining!

838
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,925
It’s raining!

839
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,400
It’s raining!

840
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,800
It’s raining!

841
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,599
The rain!

842
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,525
- It’s raining!
- It’s raining!

843
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,825
Thank god!

844
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,450
This is our hope!

845
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,719
- Thank god!
- No more hunger!

846
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,125
It’s raining!

847
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,640
It’s raining!

848
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,160
- Greetings, Madam Pearl.
- Greetings, Madam Pearl.

849
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,000
Please rise, everyone.

850
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,439
I’m so sorry

851
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,599
that I’ve been locking myself indoors.

852
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,479
Does the rain come in time?

853
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,680
- Thank you, Madam Pearl,
- Thank you, Madam Pearl,

854
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,825
- for bringing blessings to Xiping Port.
- for bringing blessings to Xiping Port.

855
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,425
Mr. Liu,

856
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,040
how much grain do we have
in Xiping Port?

857
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:28,280
About ten days’ provisions.

858
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,800
If so,

859
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,439
starting on tomorrow,

860
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,839
offer thicker porridge

861
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,119
to the refugees.

862
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,280
In that case,

863
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:36,575
we’ll hang on for 7 to 8 days at most.

864
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,239
Relief from Yuezhou hasn’t arrived.

865
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,439
The grain ships from Yuezhou

866
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:41,560
have sailed out.

867
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,640
Within three days,

868
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,119
they’ll arrive at Xiping Port.

869
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,359
Don’t worry, gentlemen.

870
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,800
If anything goes wrong,

871
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,520
I’ll take responsibility.

872
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,199
Yes.

873
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,050
Since my prayer is heard,

874
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,400
tomorrow I’ll

875
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,760
be able to look around the city.

876
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:00,959
No problem.

877
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,000
We’ll keep you company

878
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,560
wherever you go tomorrow.

879
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,560
I appreciate it.

880
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,575
Mr. Liu,

881
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,425
since the grain is sufficient,

882
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,560
open the gates to all refugees

883
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,719
that have been thrown out.

884
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,745
I’ll see to it immediately.

885
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,479
I’m so in awe

886
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,175
of this Madam Pearl.

887
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:40,800
Me, too.

888
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,719
She can make rain.

889
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,050
And she knows the refugees’ situation

890
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,359
while locking herself indoors.

891
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,050
Yes.

892
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,075
It seems true

893
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:47,760
that she did meet Dragon Tail before,

894
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,800
and is blessed with holy powers.

895
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,119
Yes, better not offend her.

896
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,160
It’s so scary.

897
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,880
You’re right.

898
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:52,719
It’s creepy.

899
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,319
Yes.

900
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,319
Mr. Liu,

901
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:58,900
I guess we have to

902
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,239
make proper preparations tonight.

903
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,760
Lord.

904
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,199
Any news

905
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,520
from the scouts?

906
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,319
Here it is.

907
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,199
Have the grain ships from Yuezhou left?

908
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:31,975
Yes.

909
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:32,959
A troop boarded

910
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:33,919
the vessels in the morning suddenly

911
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
with an order from Madam Pearl

912
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,280
to deliver the relief.

913
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,760
The grain ships had sailed out

914
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,919
before our men even arrived.

915
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,639
What’s the situation at Xiping Port?

916
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,300
Xiping Port saw
a sudden rainstorm yesterday.

917
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,439
The refugees believe they owe it

918
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:44,239
to Madam Pearl’s prayers.

919
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,760
There won’t be any riots for now.

920
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,479
Good.

921
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,840
Go to Xiping Port immediately.

922
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,679
Yes.

923
00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:22,350
(The ships left this morning.)

924
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,325
The ships have left the morning.

925
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,891
You’re staring at me.

926
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,715
Do you have something to ask me?

927
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:37,866
Yes.

928
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:39,879
I’ve been thinking about it all night.

929
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,040
But I couldn’t figure out

930
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,075
what happened in the last few days.

931
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,679
I’d like to ask you for instructions.

932
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,520
I’m all ears.

933
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,840
Do you

934
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,199
perform witchcraft

935
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,540
that makes rain?

936
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:53,320
Of course not.

937
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,360
Then why did it rain

938
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,639
exactly as you expected?

939
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,865
Did you notice

940
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,199
some red flowers

941
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,199
in the courtyard

942
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,200
on the day

943
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,119
we arrived?

944
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,199
I’m sure the flower

945
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,300
is rare here.

946
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,959
But in my hometown,

947
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,359
it’s not at all.

948
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,399
It’s known as the Weather Flower.

949
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,479
It’s very sensitive to humidity.

950
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,639
When it blooms

951
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
bright red flowers,

952
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,679
it means it’ll rain

953
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,750
within 7 days.

954
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,199
On the day we arrived,

955
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,479
I saw it

956
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,000
in full bloom.

957
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:27,040
Oh,

958
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,239
I see.

959
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:30,159
But why did Yuezhou Chamber of Commerce

960
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,050
permit the grain ships

961
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,350
to set sail when it rained?

962
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,199
The situation in the south
is complicated,

963
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,625
but most people

964
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,585
believe in Dragon Tail.

965
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,275
His Majesty made me Madam Pearl

966
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,520
because I met Dragon Tail

967
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,700
when I was a child.

968
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,840
Everyone knows that.

969
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:47,775
Mm-hmm.

970
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,760
But those merchants

971
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,360
might not believe in me.

972
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,520
So when it rained,

973
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,879
they were in awe of me.

974
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,080
With enough pressure,

975
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
they’ll do as they’re told.

976
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,049
Enough pressure?

977
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,885
His Majesty’s army.

978
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,479
Your Majesty,

979
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,399
I have a bold request to make.

980
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,719
I want some help

981
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,800
from Jifeng Pavilion

982
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,439
and some troops

983
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,325
to follow me secretly.

984
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,575
A half goes to Yuezhou,

985
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,399
and the other goes to Xiping Port

986
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,000
just in case.

987
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,080
Granted.

988
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,120
When they arrived

989
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,520
their destinations,

990
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,879
they stayed undercover

991
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,120
and waited for my command.

992
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,479
My order

993
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,959
to Yuezhou was

994
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,199
once it rains

995
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,280
in Xiping Port,

996
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,550
they’ll take control

997
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,225
of the grain ships.

998
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,800
You’re betting on their belief.

999
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,719
If the merchants

1000
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,159
were not Dragon Tail’s believers,

1001
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,280
and wouldn’t give in,

1002
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,959
you’d be put in a dangerous position.

1003
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,800
If so, the troop would be authorized

1004
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,080
by the Imperial Inspector’s Seal

1005
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,479
to kill those who disobeyed.

1006
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:56,150
So, you gave
the Imperial Inspector’s Seal

1007
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,000
to the commander

1008
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,280
of the troop in Yuezhou.

1009
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:01,000
Fortunately, killing is not necessary,

1010
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
and the ships are on their way.

1011
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,360
Madam, you’re a real

1012
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,479
strategist.

1013
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
Were you a man,

1014
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,350
you’d be a great minister.

1015
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,000
Each force in the south

1016
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,719
is somehow related to other forces.

1017
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,750
I can’t figure them out

1018
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,150
in anytime soon.

1019
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,320
Let’s drop it

1020
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,744
and get ready to go out.

1021
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,750
We have to remove

1022
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,879
the corrupted officials in Xiping Port

1023
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,478
before the grain ships arrive.

1024
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:37,750
(Jubei Granary)

1025
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,993
What’s this?

1026
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,575
What’s going on?

1027
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,919
Which one is Madam Pearl?

1028
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:45,479
I want to see her.

1029
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,250
Yes, this is her.

1030
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,950
She’s Madam Pearl?

1031
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
From what I see,

1032
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,875
we have enough rice

1033
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:15,850
for all refugees

1034
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,770
till the grain ships
from Yuezhou arrive.

1035
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,399
We owe it to Mr. Liu

1036
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,250
and Mr. Baili.

1037
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,025
- I dare not take credit for it.
- I dare not take credit for it.

1038
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,470
Guards.

1039
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,800
Considering inconvenient deployment
in Xiping Port,

1040
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,739
I asked for His Majesty’s permission
before I left.

1041
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:45,854
Except for help from Jifeng Pavilion,

1042
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:48,439
His Majesty assigned a troop

1043
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:50,040
to come with me.

1044
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,500
This morning,

1045
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,360
the troop paid a visit to the garrison.

1046
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
- What...?
- What...?

1047
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,525
What’s going on?

1048
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,439
Replacing military provisions

1049
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,679
with fodder

1050
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,399
and selling granary stock

1051
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,600
for private gain,

1052
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:30,434
even the execution

1053
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,280
isn’t a fair punishment for the crimes

1054
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,840
Mr. Liu, Mr. Baili

1055
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,360
and other officials involved committed.

1056
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,560
Had you shown any care
for people’s life,

1057
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,300
things wouldn’t

1058
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,020
have ended up like this in Xiping Port.

1059
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,479
I

1060
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,520
have nothing to say.

1061
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,239
What about you, Mr. Baili?

1062
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,439
You’re one of the Baili family

1063
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,040
of Nanhuai, Wanzhou,

1064
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,040
a rich merchant that owns
half of the southwest.

1065
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,040
Madam, you’re indeed a lady

1066
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:02,314
of superior intelligence,

1067
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,600
sheer courage,

1068
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,120
and clever tactics.

1069
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,120
I, Baili Yuan,

1070
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,080
do not justify myself.

1071
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,239
Alright then.

1072
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,760
Take them away

1073
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,199
and execute them.

1074
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,560
Wait!

1075
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,225
This was

1076
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,959
all my idea.

1077
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,800
I’m not afraid of any punishment,

1078
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,190
but this has nothing to do with Mr. Liu.

1079
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:22,676
Liu Changping

1080
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,760
is the Prefect of Xiping Port.

1081
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,919
This is a heinous crime.

1082
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,560
How could you say he’s not related?

1083
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,879
Madam, do you know how much fodder

1084
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,320
can a kilo of rice be traded for?

1085
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:33,760
Ten kilos.

1086
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,000
But with my help,

1087
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,479
we managed to get 14 kilos.

1088
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,040
The drought in the southwest

1089
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,080
was reported

1090
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,325
to the court months ago.

1091
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:44,320
But we had waited for so long

1092
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,399
until it was delivered

1093
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:46,239
to His Majesty’s desk.

1094
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:48,455
And relief from Yuezhou

1095
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,150
has been late for so long.

1096
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,425
There’s high wind
on the sea each season.

1097
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,080
Ships loaded with tea and silk

1098
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,560
depart every day for Hanzhou.

1099
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,159
However, grain ships to Xiping Port

1100
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:59,399
are not allowed to sail out.

1101
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,639
Mr. Liu had no choice

1102
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,075
but to open the granaries.

1103
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:05,639
In the past few months,

1104
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,719
we sold all the rice

1105
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,280
in Xiping Port,

1106
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,639
and bought fodder

1107
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,439
with the gold we gained.

1108
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:12,856
That’s how

1109
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,760
everyone has barely enough food

1110
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,841
to survive to this day.

1111
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,000
It is a grave crime.

1112
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:21,679
Since the day you arrived

1113
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,520
at Xiping Port,

1114
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,455
I have seen this day coming.

1115
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,159
Except to give you a false impression
of stability

1116
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:28,679
by driving refugees out of the city,

1117
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,125
Mr. Liu is genuinely a good prefect

1118
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,879
from tip to toe.

1119
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,600
Look at his face.

1120
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,439
He’s been working hard
since the start of this year.

1121
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,239
But all he can eat every day

1122
00:42:39,325 --> 00:42:41,085
is the fodder for horses.

1123
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:48,634
I

1124
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:50,800
am guilty.

1125
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,840
As the Imperial Inspector,

1126
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,334
you have to uphold
the laws of the state.

1127
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,120
Madam,

1128
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:04,320
are you really going to

1129
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:06,560
kill such a good prefect?

1130
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,679
Say no more.

1131
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,679
I am guilty.

1132
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:11,679
Is Mr. Liu really...?

1133
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,639
Madam Pearl,

1134
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,239
mercy!

1135
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:15,966
- Mr. Liu is a good prefect.
- Mr. Liu is a good prefect.

1136
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:17,325
Mr. Liu is a good prefect.

1137
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,479
Mercy!

1138
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,840
I won’t make a ruling

1139
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,605
based on one side of the story.

1140
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:25,399
Liu Changping,

1141
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,360
if your conscience is clean,

1142
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,280
stay alive.

1143
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,744
I will do you justice.

1144
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,199
I will

1145
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,226
get to the bottom of this.

1146
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,025
Yes, Madam.

1147
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,399
Grain ships from Yuezhou

1148
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:48,159
will soon arrive at Xiping Port.

1149
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,320
Madam Pearl hereby orders
to open granaries.

1150
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,159
All homeless refugees

1151
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,639
without a shelter

1152
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,679
can come to get free grain.

1153
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
Charity porridge is available
day and night

1154
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,350
for everyone.

1155
00:43:59,350 --> 00:43:59,959
- Great!
- That’s great!

1156
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:01,439
- Great news!
- Marvelous!

1157
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,800
- Great!
- Great news!

1158
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,840
We’re saved.

1159
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,350
We have food to eat.

1160
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,080
Thanks to Madam Pearl.

1161
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:08,375
Madam Pearl is truly

1162
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,399
our savior!

1163
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:15,840
It’s raining!

1164
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,800
- It’s raining!
- It’s raining!

1165
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,675
It’s raining!

1166
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Madam Pearl

1167
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,679
is our savior!

1168
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,375
That’s great!

1169
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,150
It’s great!

1170
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,919
Look, something is shining in her hand!

1171
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,639
- We’ll serve you…
- Something is shining in her hand.

1172
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,399
- as god’s messenger.
- as god’s messenger.

1173
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:34,320
God’s messenger!

1174
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,600
- We’ll serve you as god’s messenger.
- We’ll serve you as god’s messenger.

1175
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,175
- As god’s messenger!
- As god’s messenger!

1176
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:42,600
- We’ll serve you
- We’ll serve you

1177
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:44,639
- as god’s messenger!
- as god’s messenger!

1178
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,879
- We’ll serve you
- We’ll serve you

1179
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,760
- as god’s messenger!
- as god’s messenger!

1180
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,575
Lord,

1181
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,919
(Jubei Granary)
aren’t we going to meet Madam Pearl?

1182
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,000
Madam Pearl

1183
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,919
has taken everything in control.

1184
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,639
Let’s protect her secretly.

1185
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:58,600
Yes.

1186
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,159
- We’ll serve you
- We’ll serve you

1187
00:45:00,475 --> 00:45:02,205
- as god’s messenger!
- as god’s messenger!

1188
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:05,120
- We’ll serve you
- We’ll serve you

1189
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,250
- as god’s messenger!
- as god’s messenger!
