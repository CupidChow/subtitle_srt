the best swimmer in our village?

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
I can do this.

Father!

Father!

31
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,559
Long live, Your Majesty!

32
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:43,639
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,450
Rise.

34
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,069
Thank you, Your Majesty!

35
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,360
Didn’t I ask you specifically

36
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,600
not to come here?

37
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,705
I identify myself

38
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,636
with one of the old sayings,

39
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,279
“All officials ought to

40
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,519
stay close to their emperors”.

41
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,125
Funny.

42
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,000
You aren’t the first one

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,199
challenging my authority today.

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,525
Are you disregarding the rules

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
or worried about someone in particular?

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,561
Your Majesty,

47
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,151
it’s about time.

48
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,110
Let’s see it.

49
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,810
As per His Majesty’s edict,

50
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,720
pillars of the state

51
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,481
shall be the bravest of all

52
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,289
to safeguard our nation.

53
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,545
Dazheng is vast in territory

54
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,419
with waters and lands.

55
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,566
Thus, your ability to fight

56
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,525
on two landforms is of equal importance

57
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:00,500
and will both be tested.

58
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,320
Candidates for the Palace Examination

59
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:05,160
will be fighting against each other
on the drums.

60
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,275
The last three standing

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,865
can climb up the Sky Pillar.

62
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,239
The one who grabs the top prize

63
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,200
will become the first place,

64
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,236
followed by the second place

65
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,869
and the third place.

66
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,239
Begin!

67
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,150
Consort Shurong,

68
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,471
I invited you to sit in
on the Palace Examination,

69
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,600
yet you came with a veil,

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
absent-minded,

71
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,920
and not even glanced at the ring.

72
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,880
May I ask why?

73
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,799
I knew officials would attend, too.

74
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,959
As a consort,

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,225
I’m following Zhunian’s protocol

76
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
to show up with a mask.

77
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,000
And I’m looking away

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,640
because fighters out there

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
might scare me

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
with their fierceness.

81
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,519
As I recall,

82
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,825
Zhunian is a free state,

83
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,000
yet you seem to abide by

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,839
more rules

85
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,799
than what we have here in Dazheng.

86
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
I’ll do what you say, Your Majesty.

87
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,119
You’re pleasing me?

88
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,040
I’m not taking off the veil

89
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,920
to make you happy.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,560
I love you

91
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,760
and I’m willing to do anything for you.

92
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,475
You’re lying to my face

93
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,670
with all sincerity.

94
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,200
No one has ever tried that with me.

95
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,760
Commander Fang,

96
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:51,495
he’s falling.

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
He’s on his own

98
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,040
out there.

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,119
Brother!

100
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,079
Brother! Hang in there!

101
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,399
I’m coming!

102
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,799
Brother! Brother!

103
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,799
Brother!

104
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,079
Don’t give up, Brother!

105
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,720
Haishi,

106
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,079
even a dogfight calls for tactics.

107
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,880
We can join hands

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,959
and get rid of the others

109
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,000
before having a one-on-one battle

110
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,411
on the Sky Pillar. Are you in?

111
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,760
Making an alliance?

112
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
He isn’t too dumb.

113
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,440
The thing is

114
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,119
allies can soon

115
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,679
turn against each other.

116
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:49,675
He fell into the water!

117
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,775
Lord Qinghai!

118
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:26,900
Isn’t that Lord Qinghai?

119
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:27,880
Lord Qinghai!

120
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you sure?

121
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,679
I’ve only caught a glimpse of him

122
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,599
from afar years ago,

123
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,700
but a man like him

124
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,475
is certainly

125
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,359
unforgettable!

126
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,080
Report!

127
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,200
Your Majesty,

128
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
a trace of dark blood is found

129
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,440
right where Fang Haishi fell.

130
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,039
He could’ve been poisoned!

131
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,640
- Poisoned?
- Is it murder?

132
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,719
Pass my order.

133
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,350
Seal the Shuangping Lake

134
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,470
and the Imperial Examination Hotel.

135
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,559
Look into every candidate

136
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,479
for the Palace Examination today.

137
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,880
Detain all suspects

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,719
separately.

139
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,640
Yes.

140
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,039
Your Majesty.

141
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
As Grand Examiner,

142
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,520
you’ll be held accountable.

143
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,679
Minister Chen,

144
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,400
I want you to lead the investigation.

145
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,475
Your life

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,679
depends on the result.

147
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,119
I understand.

148
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,375
Hey,

149
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:11,559
Zheliu.

150
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,350
Did you just come back?

151
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,900
Yes.

152
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Those pomegranate flowers are pretty.

153
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,679
Did you get them

154
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,039
from the tree outside?

155
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:20,440
I found them on the ground.

156
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,425
Really?

157
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:21,960
Yes.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,799
And they were neat

159
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,275
and just enough to make a bouquet?

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,080
They are like this

161
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,559
when I saw them.

162
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,400
How come?

163
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,040
The bouquet could be God of Wind’s gift.

164
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,914
I don’t believe that!

165
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,250
Why didn’t he

166
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,900
give it to me?

167
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,175
- Manager.
- Manager.

168
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,016
Liu,

169
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,960
have you completed

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,799
the belt

171
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,559
for Young Master Haishi?

172
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,130
I have.

173
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,645
Please take a look.

174
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,636
Magnolia?

175
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,119
Beast patterns are more common.

176
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,359
As exquisite

177
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,440
as your flower looks,

178
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,559
it’s usually for girls.

179
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,960
Manager,

180
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Young Master Haishi

181
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,200
is good-looking and gentle

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,919
who looks strong yet slimmer

183
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,159
than most men.

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Beasts on him would be too much,

185
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,119
whereas magnolia is just about right

186
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,159
to symbolize

187
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,760
his quiet elegance.

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,359
I’m sorry that I’ve gone rogue.

189
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,479
If you find the pattern inappropriate,

190
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,599
I’ll redo it.

191
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,440
“Good-looking and gentle”.

192
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,200
“Quiet elegance”.

193
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,960
That’s a unique charm.

194
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:46,640
Never mind.

195
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,950
You’re always thorough.

196
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,479
This belt it is.

197
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,359
Are you going out?

198
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,200
Yes, to Jifeng Pavilion.

199
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,925
Young Master Haishi

200
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,565
has won twice in a row.

201
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,760
Maybe he’ll become

202
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,679
the ultimate winner today.

203
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:05,640
I’m bringing the belt over

204
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,320
as a congratulatory gift.

205
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
Yes, Manager.

206
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,960
Zheliu.

207
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:21,880
Zheliu?

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,719
Yes?

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What else

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,919
did God of Wind give you

211
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,559
other than this bouquet?

212
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,350
Tell me about it.

213
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,679
I can’t wait to know.

214
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:32,905
Nothing.

215
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:36,545
Zheliu...

216
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:38,239
Ask the physician

217
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,119
to put the finniest antidote

218
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,000
outside Haishi’s room.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,719
Others shall go back to their rooms

220
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,960
and stay away from the courtyard.

221
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,239
Close the door!

222
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:54,320
- Mother...
- Haishi!

223
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:55,919
It hurts!

224
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,559
- Hang in there.
- Mother...

225
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,250
You’ll soon get treated.

226
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,479
Stay with me.

227
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,159
Mother...

228
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,166
Haishi!

229
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:03,850
Mother...

230
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,880
Mother...

231
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,400
Be strong.

232
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,879
It might give you great pain.

233
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,750
Master...

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,925
Manager Ju,
are you here to see Commander?

235
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:12,725
- I can...
- No need.

236
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,500
I’ll come some other day.

237
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:22,725
Mu Deqing.

238
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:23,679
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,125
Why are you still here?

240
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,919
I dare not leave

241
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,080
without your permission.

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,679
I’m too busy

243
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,760
to waste any time on you.

244
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,800
Go back to Yu’an Palace
to feed your rabbit.

245
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:38,119
Summon Left General, Grand Justice,

246
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,900
and the whole Cabinet to meet me.

247
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,325
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,679
Gentlemen, finish your meal

249
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,239
and write down everything

250
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,840
you’ve seen or heard

251
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,799
during the Palace Examination.

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
Leave no details out.

253
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,679
Once your testimony is checked out

254
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,000
and you’re cleared of suspicion,

255
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,400
you’re free

256
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,675
to go back to
the Imperial Examination Hotel.

257
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:57,325
Officer,

258
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
how’s Brother…

259
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,050
No,

260
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,000
I mean, how’s Fang Haishi?

261
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:01,760
Is he alright?

262
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,919
Yes. He’s like our brother.

263
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,475
Enough!

264
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,039
Stop talking to each other,

265
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,275
or you’ll be thrown into prison!

266
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,050
I wonder how he’s doing.

267
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,719
Eat now.

268
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,039
Gentlemen,

269
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,840
as per His Majesty’s order,

270
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,359
no one can leave
before the truth comes out.

271
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520
You’ll have to

272
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,760
enjoy your meal here.

273
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,080
Minister Chen,

274
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:27,280
when

275
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
can we go home?

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
Sorry,

277
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,960
I’m still waiting for
His Majesty’s order.

278
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,500
Report!

279
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,364
Sir,

280
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,080
we found

281
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,000
a leather bracelet in the water.

282
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
It’s not commonly seen.

283
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,400
I’m afraid it might link

284
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,159
to the fall of that candidate.

285
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,359
A piece of leather

286
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,719
is far from being proof.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,559
Ask your men to go back in there

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
to dig up something

289
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
more solid.

290
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,039
Someone must’ve been
wearing this bracelet.

291
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,239
It could be used

292
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,700
for the sneak attack...

293
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
Keep it as evidence.

294
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,275
Yes.

295
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,940
Officer, may I use the men’s room?

296
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,680
I want to go, too, officer!

297
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,719
It’s been almost a day.

298
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,880
Right. I need to go, too.

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,760
Go one by one.

300
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,880
You, follow me.

301
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,520
Are you done?

302
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,800
Commander.

303
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:35,959
Commander,

304
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,400
Young Master Haishi’s wound...

305
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,025
He’s fine.

306
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,000
Most of the poison

307
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,959
has been removed.

308
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,359
All he needs is enough rest.

309
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,119
How’s...

310
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,239
How’s the investigation going?

311
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,599
I’ve had men

312
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,439
check all the candidates
for this year’s exam

313
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,920
and the Imperial Examination Hotel,

314
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,839
but nothing has turned up.

315
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,040
Meanwhile,

316
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,000
He Chong was found dead

317
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,359
with a suicide note.

318
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:56,680
He said

319
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
he poisoned Young Master Haishi

320
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:59,599
because he saw him

321
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,439
as his strongest rival

322
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,439
and wanted him out.

323
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,839
It had nothing to do with others.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
Is it true that he took his own life?

325
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:08,800
The autopsy

326
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,040
has confirmed that.

327
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,439
Besides, the penmanship
of his suicide note

328
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,560
and his exam paper

329
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,575
is a complete match.

330
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,680
That being said,

331
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:18,550
I still believe

332
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,880
there’s more to this case.

333
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,680
Any luck with the murder weapon?

334
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,300
They haven’t found it yet.

335
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,040
His death is suspicious.

336
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,040
Someone is cutting off the leads

337
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,640
to cover for the mastermind.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,920
Also, Commander,

339
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:38,886
you’re summoned to the Palace.

340
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,400
Stay with Haishi

341
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,680
and keep him safe.

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,079
I will.

343
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Welcome home, General.

344
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,256
Dinner is ready.

345
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:15,839
Pass.

346
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,229
Off you go.

347
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,600
(General for Stability’s Mansion)

348
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,319
(Virtuous, Diligent, Pleasant and Quiet)

349
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,359
I apologize

350
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,239
for overreaching

351
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,119
and blowing up my cover in public.

352
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,839
What’s your take on this case?

353
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,040
Haishi’s poison has been removed.

354
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,560
He’s stable now.

355
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Don’t you want
to get to the bottom of it?

356
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,359
I’ll take care of the rest.

357
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,319
Your Majesty would better
stay out of it.

358
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:45,920
All these years,

359
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:49,350
you’ve done so much for me

360
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,825
behind that mask

361
00:20:52,675 --> 00:20:54,560
and you’ve been shadowing me.

362
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,275
It’s time to stop.

363
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,400
I...

364
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,079
Your Majesty...

365
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,199
I’ve seen enough.

366
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
Zhaoming Palace is ready for you.

367
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,119
Pick a good day

368
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,560
and move Jifeng Pavilion

369
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,199
and everything you need

370
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,000
there altogether.

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,640
You’ve been in the dark for too long.

372
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,700
It’s time

373
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,479
to see the sunlight

374
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,640
before mold starts to grow on you.

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,950
That’s a bad idea.

376
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,775
Why?

377
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,560
You don’t want

378
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:19,560
to live in the Palace with me?

379
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:20,675
I’m a man and an outsider.

380
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:23,000
So is everyone else at Jifeng Pavilion.

381
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,719
Having us stay in the Palace

382
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,325
is unprecedented...

383
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:26,920
You’re wrong.

384
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,000
Back then,

385
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,079
when Qilin Hall

386
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,520
wasn’t destroyed by rebels,

387
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,925
members

388
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,599
of the Grand Council

389
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,760
on night shifts

390
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,705
all slept there,

391
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,959
including your father

392
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,040
years back.

393
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,839
But Zhaoming Palace is different

394
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,400
as it’s right next to the harem.

395
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
Not exactly.

396
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,650
There’s a corner gate between them.

397
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,475
Besides,

398
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,719
all members of the Jifeng Pavilion

399
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,319
have worked here

400
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,719
except for Fang Haishi.

401
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Even so,

402
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,139
he knows his way around inside.

403
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,079
I’m sorry.

404
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,439
Again?

405
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
I failed to discipline Fang Haishi

406
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,880
who offended you

407
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,924
more than once.

408
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,680
During the Palace Examination earlier,

409
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,560
he made a scene with his injury.

410
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,900
I shall be punished for his offense.

411
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,750
Punish you how?

412
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,040
Flog me 200 times.

413
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,680
I don’t get it.

414
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,839
What’s so special

415
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,920
about that person

416
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,319
that you’d take punishment
for him over and over?

417
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:22,606
Is there any unbruised skin left on you?

418
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
That Fang Jianming I know

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,479
isn’t the selfless type.

420
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,391
I’m more and more convinced

421
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,725
that you’re no longer yourself.

422
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:32,800
Your Majesty...

423
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Listen,

424
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,119
you should

425
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,920
marry Manager Ju

426
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,119
as soon as possible.

427
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,775
Your father chose her for you

428
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,696
before he passed away.

429
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,719
Qiqi is old enough

430
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,920
to leave and have her own family,

431
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,599
but she stays because of you.

432
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,880
Don’t you know that?

433
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,160
I’ve vowed

434
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,800
to remain single forever

435
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,825
so that I can devote my life to you.

436
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:56,700
Enough.

437
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,160
That again!

438
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,280
I’m sick of hearing it.

439
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Stop using me as your excuse.

440
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,800
If the Fang Family stopped at you,

441
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,150
I wouldn’t want

442
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,030
your father to blame me down there.

443
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,599
Madam.

444
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,119
What are you doing here?

445
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,325
I’ve been looking for you.

446
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,160
Liu,

447
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,079
sit with me, will you?

448
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,079
Sure.

449
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,199
In this huge palace,

450
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,640
no one’s hands

451
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,239
are as warm

452
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,450
as yours.

453
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,580
Madam,

454
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,124
are you upset?

455
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,199
No.

456
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,719
It’s just that

457
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,079
I recalled something in the past.

458
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:07,585
Like what,

459
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,040
Madam?

460
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,200
You can tell me if you want.

461
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:16,575
It’s...

462
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,079
an old history.

463
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,920
Long before the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

464
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,280
a young man of noble birth

465
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,425
was set up with

466
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,119
his father’s follower’s daughter.

467
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,359
Their marriage has finally settled

468
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
after a decade and more.

469
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,359
Qiqi is smart and considerate.

470
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,979
I’ve always seen her as my own daughter.

471
00:24:40,575 --> 00:24:41,160
Thank you.

472
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,520
By accepting our betrothal gifts,

473
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,520
she’s become Jianming’s fiancée.

474
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,680
My wife and I

475
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,079
will watch over his shoulder

476
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,839
and make sure

477
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,079
Qiqi isn’t mistreated at all.

478
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,520
Father,

479
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,560
Uncle Ju.

480
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,839
Young Master.

481
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,940
I won’t marry her.

482
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,400
Parents are to decide

483
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,475
who their sons marry.

484
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:03,439
It’s not up to you.

485
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,199
Young Master,

486
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:07,439
you know...

487
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,439
Qiqi grew up with you.

488
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,079
You two are always close.

489
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,000
Is it

490
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,150
- what she did that upsets you?
- No.

491
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,359
No, she did nothing wrong.

492
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,199
She’s a lovely girl.

493
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:23,359
If so,

494
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,079
why do you refuse to marry her?

495
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,199
She deserves

496
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
someone better

497
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,079
than me.

498
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,319
We’re just friends

499
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,359
because of our two families.

500
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,760
Nothing is going on between us.

501
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:38,079
Besides, I’ve pledged

502
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,270
to help the nation and serve the people
since I was young.

503
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,119
I don’t have time for love.

504
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,439
How arrogant!

505
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,959
Do you think

506
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,125
your portrait will end up in Qilin Hall?

507
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,324
Why not?

508
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:51,920
Great Grandfather had...

509
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,800
He,

510
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,489
like every man in this world,

511
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,319
got married and had children.

512
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,160
But then he died before 30.

513
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,040
You...

514
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,375
His baby grew up

515
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
fatherless

516
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,319
and his wife became

517
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,199
a young widow

518
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:06,486
who spent the rest of her life alone.

519
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
Lord,

520
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:10,319
your son

521
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:11,599
is still young.

522
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,040
His marriage

523
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,880
can wait.

524
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,839
Why not...

525
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,800
Why not wait a bit longer?

526
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,925
Wait as long as you like,

527
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,124
but I won’t change my mind.

528
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:23,954
Then what?

529
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,599
Then...

530
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,119
Their marriage

531
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,350
didn’t happen.

532
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,119
Despite distance,

533
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,560
time

534
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,880
and aging,

535
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,439
all that girl wished

536
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,280
was that man

537
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,150
could look her

538
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:52,025
in the eye for once.

539
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,839
Madam,

540
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
it’s getting cold.

541
00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:03,445
Let’s go back.

542
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,800
(Zichen Hall)
His Majesty’s edict is as follows:

543
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
the investigation

544
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,880
has linked the poisoning

545
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,359
during the Palace Examination

546
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:39,359
to He Chong, a candidate from Shanyang

547
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,880
who had committed suicide
for fear of punishment.

548
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,225
Record shows

549
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:46,040
no next of kin of his,

550
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,520
thus case closed.

551
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,000
He Chong’s ranking

552
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,439
will be canceled.

553
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,479
This year’s first place remains vacant,

554
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,119
while the second place goes to

555
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,359
Zhuo Yifan,

556
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,880
and the third place goes to

557
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,439
Fang Haishi.

558
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
Respect this.

559
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,726
Yes, Your Majesty.

560
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,660
Su Ming.

561
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,055
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:29:15,575 --> 00:29:18,054
Candidates for the Palace Examination

563
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,359
are likely to hold the future

564
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,160
of our nation.

565
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:23,995
But this year,

566
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,719
one of them poisoned the other

567
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,359
and killed himself afterwards.

568
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,040
That makes me wonder

569
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
how an evil perpetrator like him

570
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,719
made it to the final round.

571
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,160
As Grand Examiner,

572
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,079
what do you have to say about that?

573
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:41,400
I shall be punished

574
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,119
for my negligence.

575
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,214
With the Examination
only held every three years

576
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,550
and tens of thousands

577
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,525
of people’s future on the line,

578
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,560
calling yourself negligent

579
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,199
is soft-pedaling the matter.

580
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,080
After all, the Imperial Examination

581
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,199
is of national importance.

582
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,400
General for Stability, Su Ming,

583
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:02,160
shall be punished

584
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,599
for neglect of his duty
during the Examination

585
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,160
by demoting him to two ranks below

586
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,425
to Chief Commander of Beifu Army

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,300
and deducting three years of his pay
as a warning to others.

588
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,520
I deserve to die.

589
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,920
Thank you for your mercy, Your Majesty.

590
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,839
I

591
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,916
could never repay you for that.

592
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,275
Save it.

593
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,200
I know you’re loyal.

594
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,119
You assisted me in ascending the throne.

595
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,719
But your contribution in the past

596
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,825
won’t shield you

597
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,640
from bending the law now.

598
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:36,680
There will be consequences.

599
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,780
I understand, Your Majesty.

600
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,795
I’ll devote myself to the service

601
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,839
and reflect on my mistakes.

602
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,975
Summon Lord Qinghai in.

603
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,599
Summon Lord Qinghai in!

604
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,199
I thought there was no one

605
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,479
to inherit that title

606
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,775
after Young Master Fang died of illness.

607
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,719
I thought so, too.

608
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,839
Who’s this Lord Qinghai?

609
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:36,000
It’s Young Master Fang!

610
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,319
Lord Qinghai!

611
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,160
- He’s back.
- He’s Lord Qinghai.

612
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,959
Lord Qinghai is back.

613
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,000
It’s Lord Qinghai.

614
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,666
Fang Zhu pays his respects to you,
Your Majesty.

615
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,450
Rise.

616
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:03,965
Thank you, Your Majesty.

617
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,925
Lord Qinghai of all generations

618
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,760
is loyal and gallant.

619
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,160
Mr. Fang was at death’s door repeatedly

620
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,479
for protecting me years back.

621
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,520
Right now,

622
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,880
he’s recovered

623
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,800
and shall be reinstated.

624
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,475
He’ll assist

625
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,775
with state affairs as Lord Qinghai

626
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,680
with Liushang as his hereditary fief.

627
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:33,760
He’ll also be appointed
Commander-in-chief of Credentials

628
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,239
with Left General under him

629
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,920
to lead the Wenwu Army

630
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,079
and Secret Force of Jifeng Pavilion.

631
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,700
And Jifeng Pavilion

632
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,719
will be moved into Zhaoming Palace,

633
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,439
effective immediately.

634
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:44,880
Zhaoming Palace?

635
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:45,719
That’s right.

636
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:46,920
Wasn’t that place

637
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,975
belong to the Third Prince, Shuyun?

638
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,800
Any objections?

639
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,040
Congratulations, Brother,

640
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,479
on regaining the hero!

641
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:59,400
Congratulations to Lord Qinghai
on his return!

642
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,239
Congratulations, Your Majesty,

643
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,040
on regaining the hero!

644
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,359
Congratulations to Lord Qinghai

645
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,680
on his return!

646
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:12,626
Fang Jianming has regained his identity.

647
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,225
It’ll be even harder

648
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,650
to kill him.

649
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,689
Leave my people alone,

650
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,350
or I’ll make you pay

651
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:57,596
with blood.

652
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:16,679
My lord.

653
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,399
Is he awake?

654
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,239
Not yet

655
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,320
since you left

656
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,879
this morning.

657
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,320
Give it to me.

658
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,040
Yes.

00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,925
What’s the status of Zhaoming Palace?

699
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,280
Your Majesty,

700
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,719
we’ve been rushing to set up the place.

701
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,001
It’s almost done.

702
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,639
Lord Qinghai

703
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,879
and all the people with Jifeng Pavilion

704
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,175
will be able to move in very soon.

705
00:37:59,175 --> 00:37:59,825
Good.

706
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,425
Make sure they have everything.

707
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,450
Yes.

708
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,210
Of course.

709
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,560
I’m glad

710
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:09,040
that you and Lord Qinghai

711
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,719
can be with each other all day

712
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,199
like the good old days.

713
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
Stop there!

714
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,360
What do you mean by

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
“be with each other all day”?

716
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,959
Are we a couple?

717
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:22,750
It came out wrong.

718
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,120
What I mean is

719
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,719
I’m happy for you.

720
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
Overjoyed, actually!

721
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:54,679
Your Majesty,

722
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,719
this... this isn’t the way
to Jingcheng Hall.

723
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,560
Did I say I was going there?

724
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:07,885
Your Highness.

725
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:09,550
Any update?

726
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,520
Mr. Fang Haishi has been

727
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,719
at Jifeng Pavilion

728
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,080
since Lord Qinghai took him away.

729
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,399
He was in court

730
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,400
this morning.

731
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,350
I’m sure

732
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,630
Mr. Fang Haishi is fine.

733
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,040
That’s a relief.

734
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,000
He’s a good man.

735
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,439
Dragon Tail will bless him.

736
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:25,679
I hope so.

737
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,399
A charming

738
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,199
and kind-hearted gentleman like him

739
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,840
will certainly be blessed.

740
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:34,644
You sound cheerful, Consort Shurong.

741
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,030
Greetings, Your Majesty.

742
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:44,905
Again you’re discussing
a court official with your maids.

743
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,159
It must be a custom of Zhunian

744
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,959
for ladies of the harem

745
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,450
to interfere in state affairs.

746
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:54,639
What now?

747
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,199
Hearing that Mr. Fang Haishi

748
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,840
is moving into Zhaoming Palace,

749
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,719
are you getting your hope up again?

750
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:02,879
I wouldn’t dare.

751
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,600
Rise.

752
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:07,120
Yes.

753
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,876
Your eyes are saying the opposite.

754
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,479
Mr. Fang Haishi

755
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,479
once saved my life.

756
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:29,399
I’m slightly concerned about him

757
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,790
out of mere friendship.

758
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,000
“Slightly concerned about him

759
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:42,280
out of mere friendship”?

760
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,375
Consort Shurong,

761
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,000
you might as well

762
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,600
be honest

763
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,839
and tell me the truth.

764
00:40:51,025 --> 00:40:51,904
That way,

765
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,000
I might consider

766
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,550
bringing you two together.

767
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,159
I love you wholeheartedly, Your Majesty.

768
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,600
Heaven can be my witness.

769
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,150
Really?

770
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,750
Absolutely.

771
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,160
How are you

772
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,775
going to prove that?

773
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,200
I want you tonight.

774
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,919
Later, when you’re in my bed

775
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:38,959
for the first time,

776
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:41,325
I hope

777
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:43,100
you can still look me in the eye

778
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,027
and

779
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,320
repeat what you just said

780
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,665
from the bottom of your heart.

781
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,360
Hold on! Wait!

782
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,879
I have a few more bags.

783
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,719
What about this closet?

784
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,560
This one?

785
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,719
Just take it with us.

786
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,479
We’ve had it

787
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:13,639
for a couple of years.

788
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,875
It’s no longer useful.

789
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:16,800
There are plenty of them in the Palace.

790
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:18,760
Watch your step. Be careful.

791
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:19,760
Hurry! Let’s go!

792
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,875
Drop them off first.

793
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,600
Hey, hey, hey!

794
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,725
Careful.

795
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
Watch it!

796
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:25,675
Go, go, go.

797
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:27,145
Let’s go.

798
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,840
Easy!

799
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,120
Don’t drop anything.

800
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,080
Nice and easy!

801
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,280
There’s more.

802
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:37,496
Move them out.

803
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,879
Go.

804
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:41,879
Young Master Haishi.

805
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,800
What are you doing?

806
00:42:44,025 --> 00:42:45,719
Jifeng Pavilion
is relocated in the Palace.

807
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,975
You don’t know that?

808
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,560
You should rest

809
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,600
until you’re recovered.

810
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:50,679
We’ll take care of

811
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,850
the moving and stuff.

812
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,919
We’re moving into the Palace?

813
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:54,679
That’s right.

814
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,679
His Majesty has ordered

815
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,520
all of us

816
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
to move.

817
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,679
From now on,

818
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,199
we’ll be based in the Palace.

819
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,360
Thanks for your work.

820
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,260
Master.

821
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,879
Master.

822
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:24,239
You must’ve had a long day

823
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,399
at Left General’s Mansion.

824
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:27,159
Let me go make you some food.

825
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,239
No need.

826
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,319
You’re still wounded.

827
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,919
How are you feeling today?

828
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:35,975
Good.

829
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,439
Thanks to you,

830
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,919
I’ve become much better.

831
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,239
I’m busy lately.

832
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,840
Take good care of yourself.

833
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,080
Are you sure you’re going,
Your Highness?

834
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
The Emperor of Dazheng

835
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,399
is dangerous.

836
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,520
Maybe we can figure something out

837
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,400
so that you don’t have to go.

838
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:09,800
Your Highness,

839
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,719
consorts in Dazheng

840
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:11,520
are requested

841
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,199
to bathe at Shuixin Palace

842
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,439
before being taken to Jincheng Palace

843
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,199
for the night with His Majesty.

844
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,280
Eunuchs taking you

845
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,525
to bathe

846
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:19,525
are coming as we speak.

847
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,320
Say something, Your Highness!

848
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,199
We need a plan now!

849
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,719
I appreciate their work.

850
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:30,439
Bizi,

851
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:31,760
don’t forget to reward them.

852
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,560
Your Highness!

853
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,150
Ask Jianming to come over

854
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,175
for chess.

855
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,320
Your Majesty,

856
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,840
as the newly appointed

857
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,000
Commander-in-chief of Credentials,

858
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,840
Lord Qinghai

859
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,800
must still be at Left General’s Mansion

860
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
for inspection at this hour.

861
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:01,560
On the other hand,

862
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,175
Consort Shurong

863
00:45:03,175 --> 00:45:04,625
should be on her way here.

864
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:06,080
What’s she here for?

865
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:08,040
Who asked her to come?

866
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:11,679
It was you, Your Majesty.

867
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,840
Have you forgotten

868
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,700
that you said

869
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,919
you wanted her

870
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,239
tonight?

871
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,800
That’s why she’s coming.

872
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,171
Consort Shurong has arrived!

873
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,790
Good evening, Your Majesty.

874
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:13,645
Do it.

875
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:15,764
Yes.

876
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,019
What are you doing?

877
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,840
How dare you touch me?

878
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:39,704
You said,

879
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,360
“Do it”.

880
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,505
Did they teach you nothing?

881
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,891
They taught me everything.

882
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,479
Music, dance, table service,

883
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:50,040
poetry of Dazheng.

884
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,800
I’ve spared no effort

885
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,040
to learn everything to please you.

886
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,275
I thought you knew.

887
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,840
Turns out, you know nothing!

888
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,639
I don’t understand.

889
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,881
What did I do wrong?

890
00:47:10,425 --> 00:47:11,744
You can teach me, Your Majesty.

891
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,841
I don’t even want to touch you,

892
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,371
let alone teach you.

893
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,719
And teach you what?

894
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:19,558
How to please me?

895
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,879
Who do you think you are?

896
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,479
If you only

897
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,520
like Zizan,

898
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,655
I can be her, too.

899
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:44,175
How dare you!

900
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,025
Mu Deqing!

901
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,025
Your Majesty!

902
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:49,344
Consort Shurong, Corolti,

903
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,080
is guilty of disobedience

904
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,360
and multiple offenses.

905
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,840
Confine her to the South Palace.

906
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:54,800
I don’t want to see that face

907
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,560
ever again!

908
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:58,054
