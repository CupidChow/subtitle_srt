You got

26
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,240
what I just said?

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,150
Yes, Father.

28
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,790
Good.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
When you see

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,440
a beautiful mermaid down there,

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,240
pull her up

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,839
and she’ll give us luminous pearls

00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:46,839
enough for us

this year’s tributes.

Understand?

Yes.

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,675
Uncle Zhu, Uncle Jin,

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
I’m going in.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Haishi!

42
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,679
Aren’t you afraid at all?

43
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,119
Don’t you always call me

44
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,250
the best swimmer in our village?

45
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,039
I can do this.

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,880
When you see

47
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,799
a beautiful mermaid down there,

48
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:10,799
pull her up

49
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,480

Haishi!

Come here.

57
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:36,079
I got you.

58
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,956
I got you.

59
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,450
Let me untie the rope.

60
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:39,200
Wait.

61
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey.

62
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,375
Father!

63
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,119
Father, look!

64
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:45,964
Come!

65
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,480
Come over!

66
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,040
Ye,

67
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,040
- Come!
- this is our chance.

68
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,119
- I’m here!
- Do it!

69
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,399
Come on!

70
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:56,965
Come here.

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,025
Come over!

72
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:06,986
It’s now or never!

73
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,205
Haishi,

74
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:19,359
I’m so sorry,

75
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:20,200
dear!

76
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,559
I don’t have a choice!

77
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,600
Rest in peace.

78
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,125
I’ll burn you goodies every day.

79
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,200
I’ll give you

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
whatever you want.

81
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:39,935
Luminous pearls!

82
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,040
There they are!

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,799
Haishi!

84
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:41,755
Haishi!

85
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,760
If it weren’t for

86
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
the Emperor’s greed
for pearls every year,

87
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,600
I’d never trade your life

88
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,279
for merfolks’ tears!

89
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,920
I’m very sorry.

90
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,720
Father!

91
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
Father!

92
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:05,519
Haishi!

93
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,825
Haishi!

94
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,079
Father!

95
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,519
Haishi! Haishi!

96
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,599
Come here!

97
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,239
Father!

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Father!

99
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,479
Father!

100
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:00,725
Father!

101
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:01,919
Father!

102
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,359
Father!

103
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,640
Father!

104
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,119
Father!

105
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,799
Father!

106
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,821
Father?

107
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,500
Father?

108
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,760
Uncle Jin?

109
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,975
Uncle Zhu?

110
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,825
Father?

111
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,550
Father?

112
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,350
Uncle Jin? Uncle Zhu?

113
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:10,760
Father?

114
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,080
You call these pearls?

115
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,400
Grains of sand are bigger than them!

116
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,760
Sir!

117
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
Please! Please spare us!

118
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,479
Have mercy on us!

119
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,875
You lowly lazybones!

120
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,119
- We’ve handed in all our pearls.
- Guards!

121
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:38,119
Take them all away!

122
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:38,750
Yes!

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
Please don’t!

124
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,440
Spare us, sir!

125
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,479
My husband and daughter are at sea.

126
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,919
They’ll bring back pearls!

127
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,520
I have the finest luminous pearls!

128
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,479
- It’s Haishi!
- Haishi is back!

129
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,799
It’s Haishi! It is her!

130
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,575
It’s Haishi! She’s back!

131
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
Haishi is back! Thank heavens!

132
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,650
Has she got the pearls?

133
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,960
I have the finest luminous pearls!

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,750
She has the pearls! We’re safe!

135
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,975
Is she back alone?

136
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:08,650
We can live!

137
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,525
Where’s her father?

138
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,400
And Zhu and Jin?

139
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Right.

140
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,850
Where’s your father?

141
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,700
She’s the only one back.

142
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,679
Where’s Jin?

143
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,275
Where’s Zhu?

144
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,275
They went to the sea together.

145
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,788
Where are the rest of them?

146
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,000
Sharks ate them.

147
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,450
Sharks?

148
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,000
How could this happen?

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,225
- Enough.
- My poor husband

150
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,950
- and Haishi’s father were both killed.
- Give me the pearls.

151
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,375
Poor men!

152
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,525
- What should I do?
- How could you leave me alone?

153
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:35,675
The pearl tax got them killed!

154
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:38,325
I can’t live without you!

155
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,080
My poor husband!

156
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,450
Be quiet! It’s annoying!

157
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,359
Our good days are coming.

158
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,050
Shut it, peasants!

159
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,719
- Don’t make a sound,
- You can’t leave me like this...

160
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,159
or I’ll feed you all to sharks!

161
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,200
Guys,

162
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,625
do you

163
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,919
see any luminous pearls here?

164
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,640
Not at all.

165
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
- No.
- No.

166
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,000
But...

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,559
This poor place

168
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,040
doesn’t even have the cheapest pearls,

169
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:03,745
let alone the luminous ones.

170
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,175
Burn down this village!

171
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,280
Pearl tax is levied by His Majesty.

172
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,125
Without pearls,
you’ll have to be slaves!

173
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,400
Those who refuse to comply

174
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,225
will be regarded as rebels!

175
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,100
- Kneel!
- Kneel!

176
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,800
Haishi!

177
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,925
- Let go of me!
- Move!

178
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:27,625
Go! Move it!

179
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,400
Haishi!

180
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,350
Mother!

181
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:33,300
Move!

182
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,550
Get up!

183
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,880
She stabbed General!

184
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,119
Everyone, seize her!

185
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,000
Don’t let her get away!

186
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Run!

187
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
- Over there!
- Go!

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,150
Go!

189
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,675
She’s there! Go!

190
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,275
Go!

191
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,425
Over here! Stop!

192
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,775
That way!

193
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,300
Go get her!

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,520
Stop! Stop there!

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,775
Stop!

196
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,000
Stop!

197
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,375
Stop!

198
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,325
Stop!

199
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,050
Stop!

200
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,159
What’s your name?

201
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,159
Ye Haishi.

202
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,450
Would you like to

203
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,760
go to the capital with us?

204
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:36,284
Will you save my mother?

205
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,200
I promise

206
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,659
they’ll all be safe.

207
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,605
If you can keep your promise

208
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,846
to protect my mother and the others,

209
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,979
I’ll go with you.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If you choose

211
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,739
to be a girl by my side,

212
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:55,845
other than safety,

213
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,495
I can’t guarantee you anything.

214
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,080
But,

215
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:01,945
being a boy

216
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,695
will enjoy a lot more

217
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,359
except for safety.

218
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,039
What do you want to be?

219
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,250
A boy!

220
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,400
I want to be a boy!

221
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,850
Let’s go.

222
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,139
Master.

223
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,599
I recalled the way you looked at me

224
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,640
when I found you

225
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,569
at the war-torn Red Plain back then.

226
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,341
Yes.

227
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,359
That was four years ago.

228
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:47,900
True.

229
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,414
She just gave me the same look.

230
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,960
With proper guidance,

231
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:57,799
she can make a difference to the world.

232
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,016
Take care of her mother
and the villagers.

233
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,450
Inform assets at Jifeng Pavilion

234
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,545
to look into those troops

235
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:08,850
and track down every pearl

236
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,375
along the coast.

237
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:11,839
Yes, Master.

238
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,599
Off you go.

239
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,599
Father!

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,726
Father!

241
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,880
Father!

242
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,741
A bad dream?

243
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:41,725
Yes.

244
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:43,784
We’re still in the carriage.

245
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,680
Did you bandage me up?

246
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:54,994
I did.

247
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
I’ll repay you

248
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,650
for all that you’ve done.

249
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:03,600
Sure.

250
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,000
Sir,

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,300
may I ask why you’re wearing a mask?

252
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,680
Are you scared?

253
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,719
A little bit.

254
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,525
Don’t be.

255
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,839
Go back to sleep.

256
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,260
Fine.

257
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,640
His Majesty has shot a pheasant!

258
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,119
Great precision!

259
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,000
You’re a wonderful archer, Your Majesty!

260
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,359
Very well done!

261
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,119
I expected to see
all kinds of beasts in the woods.

262
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,839
Yet there are no tigers

263
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,160
or bears in sight,

264
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,439
but only a few

265
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,640
pheasants and rabbits.

266
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,280
Your Majesty,

267
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,675
you’re the chosen one by heaven.

268
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,155
Your might

269
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:40,359
has deterred them from approaching.

270
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,280
Tigers and bears

271
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,040
are unavailable,

272
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,000
and I’m sick of

273
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,959
shooting birds.

274
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,079
Why don’t you run around

275
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,119
on your horse

276
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,119
and I’ll shoot your hat off?

277
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,119
Your Majesty!

278
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Your Majesty!

279
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Spare me, Your Majesty!

280
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,640
Please!

281
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,079
This is no joke!

282
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,680
I hate liars the most.

283
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,079
I’m not!

284
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,359
I’d never lie to you, Your Majesty!

285
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,040
Please trust me!

286
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,199
Your Majesty,

287
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,439
one of noble birth

288
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,439
shall never put himself in danger.

289
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,900
Keeping dangerous beasts away

290
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:18,920
from the hunting ground

291
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,880
is a tradition for 100 years.

292
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,000
We’re doing the same

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,959
for your safety,

294
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:24,760
especially

295
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,880
when Prince Yi’s remaining forces

296
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,199
might take this chance to strike again.

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,225
I can’t wait

298
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,560
for them to do it!

299
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,079
Alright.

300
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,260
I’ll be here waiting for them.

301
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:49,760
His Majesty has left

302
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,119
for the hunting ground.

303
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,760
What?

304
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:04,800
Your Majesty!

305
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
It’s dangerous to go inside!

306
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,319
Your Majesty!

307
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,599
Your Majesty!

308
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,079
Your Majesty!

309
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,839
Does it still hurt?

310
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,025
Not anymore.

311
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,351
Tianqi City is right ahead.

312
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,756
Look outside if you like.

313
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:50,525
Alright.

314
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,005
Just trees.

315
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,359
When will we

316
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,599
arrive in the capital?

317
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,690
In about one hour.

318
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,079
Sir,

319
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,560
I see two horses.

320
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,504
They’re from the Palace.

321
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,475
Stop the carriage.

322
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:18,756
Fire the signal.

323
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,199
A signal from Commander.

324
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
Hunting ground in the west.

325
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,479
The signal will expose

326
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,160
our location.

327
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,880
Take her away on a horse.

328
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
Yes.

329
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:35,915
Sir!

330
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,439
Peaceful days are over

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
much sooner than I expected.

332
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,040
I’ll take care of them.

333
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:30,839
Just go!

334
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,680
Help!

335
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,040
Somebody help!

336
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,219
Watch out!

337
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,045
Sir!

338
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:13,274
You... you’re Lord Qinghai!

339
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,359
Didn’t you die long ago?

340
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:17,800
Whatever.

341
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,359
I’ll kill you both

342
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,680
to avenge Prince Yi!

343
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,719
You will die now!

344
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,400
You’re as clumsy as before.

345
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,880
There’s blood on your face.

346
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,325
I know you’re a neat freak,

347
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,475
so I’ll let the arrow stay for now

348
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
in case you’re showered with blood.

349
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,319
Pull back!

350
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,959
Is the arrow poisoned?

351
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:44,950
Capture them alive!

352
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:45,839
- Your Majesty!
- Yes! Go!

353
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,719
Your Majesty!

354
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
Your Majesty!

355
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,560
- Sir!
- Your Majesty!

356
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,600
- You’re wounded!
- Sir!

357
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,760
Please punish me, Your Majesty!

358
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,225
Pearl tax is levied by His Majesty.

359
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,439
Those who refuse to comply

360
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,439
will be regarded as rebels!

361
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,920
How are you holding up, Commander?

362
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,800
I’m fine and worry-free

363
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,119
as long as you’re safe,

364
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,319
Your Majesty.

365
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,319
Your well-being

366
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,020
concerns the entire state.

367
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,119
I hope you won’t take such a risk again.

368
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,680
Enough.

369
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,400
That’s not just me talking,

370
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
but Zi...

371
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,839
That’s Emperor Xu.

372
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:29,719
I can’t believe I saved the one

373
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,880
who imposed the pearl tax on us

374
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,400
that killed

375
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,160
Father and many others.

376
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,599
Get him back for treatment immediately.

377
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,354
I’m bored. My day is totally ruined.

378
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,000
- We’re going back.
- Your Majesty...

379
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,526
Sir!

380
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,450
Steady!

381
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,199
- Go!
- Slowly!

382
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,079
Be careful!

383
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,675
Leave Commander to them.

384
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,880
Get out, all of you.

385
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,239
But your wound...

386
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,400
Leave me alone!

387
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

388
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,680
Scalpel.

389
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,599
Wait!

390
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,079
What are the chances, Physician?

391
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,319
The poison has only gone under his skin.

392
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,040
The infected tissue

393
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,000
must be removed quickly

394
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,270
or he’ll be in critical condition.

395
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,159
Fang Jianming...

396
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,439
Sir!

397
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:41,235
You’ve been here all night?

398
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,125
Yes.

399
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,681
You must’ve figured it out yesterday

400
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,880
that I’m the Commander of Secret Force.

401
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,760
You’ll never be safe with me.

402
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,225
I...

403
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:51,346
It’s not too late to regret.

404
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,171
I said

405
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,235
I’d repay you once I grow up.

406
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,546
I can’t go back on my word.

407
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,870
Follow me.

408
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,625
Bow to Commander as his disciple.

409
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,119
Sir,

410
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,150
please have tea.

411
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,491
Stop calling me “sir”.

412
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,900
From now on,

413
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,920
you’ll be a Fang after me

414
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,180
and I’ll be your master.

415
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:48,040
Master!

416
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,239
Rise.

417
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,179
Greetings, Young Master Haishi!

418
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:17,795
Your Majesty, during yesterday’s hunting,
I shall be punished

419
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,560
for not being there for you

420
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,289
when you were ambushed.

421
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,479
I went on the spur of the moment

422
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
without telling you, Mr. Su.

423
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,760
It’s not your fault.

424
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,520
You may rise.

425
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,665
Thank you, Your Majesty.

426
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:38,680
Secret Force will hand over

427
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:41,345
Prince Yi’s remnants
they captured to you.

428
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,280
I want you

429
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,999
to take it from there.

430
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,359
Thank you for your trust, Your Majesty.

431
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,239
Make a clean sweep

432
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,880
and leave no evil behind.

433
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,520
If there’s nothing else,

434
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,439
you may leave.

435
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,490
Good day, Your Majesty.

436
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,025
(Confession: I served under Prince Yi
years ago and survived the war.)

437
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,500
(The assassination was to avenge him.
No one else was behind it.)

438
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:17,800
General,

439
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:18,839
it’s late.

440
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,825
Their confessions

441
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:20,800
can wait until tomorrow.

442
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,319
The captives

443
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,500
are hard to crack.

444
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,199
They haven’t coughed up

445
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:29,839
anything important

446
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,760
under torture.

447
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,560
I must

448
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,400
bring all their accomplices at large

449
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
to justice

450
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,199
as His Majesty asked!

451
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,199
General,

452
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,950
two of Prince Yi’s followers

453
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,855
were dumped outside.

454
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,725
General,

455
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:52,800
they’re still breathing.

456
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,319
Someone must’ve knocked them out.

457
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,275
Take them into custody

458
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,375
for questioning.

459
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,239
Yes.

460
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,359
Master.

461
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,975
Did you just come back?

462
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,650
Yes.

463
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,225
I’ve completed the task

464
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:27,000
as per your order, Master.

465
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,650
Good.

466
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:29,535
From now on,

467
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,775
treat her as your younger brother.

468
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:33,565
I hope you can

469
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:34,985
watch each other’s backs.

470
00:33:35,525 --> 00:33:36,806
- Yes, Master!
- Yes, Master!

471
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,959
Haishi.

472
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,079
Young Master.

473
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,359
Don’t be so formal

474
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,479
as if we’re strangers.

475
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,040
I’ve always wanted a younger brother.

476
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,000
And now, I have you.

477
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,880
From now on,

478
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,199
we’re family.

479
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:52,225
Thanks.

480
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,059
Young Master,

481
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,239
have you seen my mother?

482
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,124
How is she?

483
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,520
“Young Master” again?

484
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,880
Your mother is good.

485
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,229
She asked me to give you this

486
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:10,850
and tell you

487
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,919
everything is fine at home.

488
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,500
Be good here

489
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,560
and study hard.

490
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:17,159

492
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,476
Thank you, Zhuoying.

493
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,765
You should thank Master for it.

494
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,719
How do you feel at Jifeng Pavilion?

495

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,439

You can’t wait to work there?

607
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,879
Master,

608
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,560
Jifeng Pavilion

609
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,080
is the Secret Force under His Majesty.

610
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,879
I’ll have to work for him
sooner or later.

611
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,679
I couldn’t do anything
when I was little,

612
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,080
but now, I’ve grown up.

613
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,399
I have enough skills.

614
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,175
I mean,

615
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,280
better sooner than later, right?

616
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:25,159
Hang in there.

617
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,639
I’d rather

618
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:29,875
go out with you and Zhuoying

619
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,479
than worry for you at home every time.

620
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,840
Master,

621
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,959
you can

622
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,560
send me in now

623
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,159
so that I can know my way around first.

624
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,040
Then by the time you need me,

625
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,879
I’ll be of greater help.

626
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,679
That can wait until you get older.

627
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,520
Master,

628
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,159
you can’t even

629
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,840
think of a better excuse.

630
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
You’ve been telling me

631
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,300
the same thing all these years.

632
00:40:58,399 --> 00:40:59,399
Commander.

633
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,439
Come in.

634
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:08,719
Commander.

635
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,239
Get the word out.

636
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,479
Take action immediately.

637
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,120
No delay is allowed.

638
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,600
Yes.

639
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
General Su,

640
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,840
you’ve been on the rise

641
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,250
ever since the Battle of Tongping City.

642
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,919
Good for you!

643
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,399
Said by the sore loser, Prince Yi’s man.

644
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,000
Sadly, you’re too blind and deaf

645
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,199
to notice

646
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,520
your enemy is right under your nose.

647
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
Is that how Chu Zhongxu

648
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,800
repay you for your loyalty?

649
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,120
Addressing His Majesty by his name

650
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,840
is a capital offense!

651
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,520
Don’t you want revenge?

652
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,919
I’ve anticipated this day

653
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,360
since I vowed to
avenge Prince Yi’s death.

654
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
But you should know

655
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,959
Fang Jianming, who killed your father,

656
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,280
is still alive.

657
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,225
He’s there with Chu Zhongxu,

658
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:28,250
doing all kinds of evil
behind that silver mask.

659
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:33,239
I don’t buy your nonsense.

660
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,239
During the hunting ground
assassination years ago,

661
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,719
Fang Jianming’s mask fell off

662
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,520
his face.

663
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,239
I saw him with my own eyes.

664
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,000
Have you never seen

665
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,800
that face underneath the silver mask?

666
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,120
Clearly, your emperor doesn’t trust you

667
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,919
as much as you thought.

668
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,679
Dig deep.

669
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,450
No one can get away!

670
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,399
Yes, sir!

671
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,719
Right Force has moved up the attack.

672
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,159
Once they move,

673
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,560
Prince Yi will see through
Prince Xu’s plan.

674
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,199
If his troops come straight to us,

675
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,120
we won’t stand a chance.

676
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,959
Charge!

677
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:42,120
Father!

678
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,880
Father!

679
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,940
Fang Jianming,

680
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,630
you began the encirclement early

681
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,990
and my father died for it.

682
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,199
You must

683
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:07,836
pay the price for his death.

684
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,360
Fang Haishi!

685
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,869
What’s got into you?

686
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,639
You were always stingy

687
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:30,439
even when we asked you

688
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,639
to pick up goodies with public funds.

689
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,760
What’s with this splurge?

690
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:35,080
Sea cucumbers and ginseng?

691
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,439
Nice!

692
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:38,976
What...?

693
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,199
Don’t touch it. That dish isn’t for you.

694
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:42,850
Why can’t I?

695
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,439
I made

696
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:44,919
all these for Master.

697
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,159
He’s my master, too.

698
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,525
Why can’t I eat it?

699
00:44:47,525 --> 00:44:48,446
Were you wounded?

700
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,625
Did you travel a long way?

701
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:50,919
Were you on a mission?

702
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,850
Master got wounded?

703
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:58,919
Fang Haishi,

704
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,199
I didn’t see you cook anything at all

705
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,199
when it was me who got hurt.

706
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:04,199
Apparently,

707
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:05,439
you’re only

708
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:06,800
trying to make Master happy.

709
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:07,959
In that case,

710
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,199
don’t drag me

711
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,520
to the drill ground with you again.

712
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,080
I’m eating it!

713
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,159
Go away!

714
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,239
Master!

715
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,400
Master.

716
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,879
Master,

717
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:28,919
have some soup.

718
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:30,360
There are sea cucumbers

719
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,320
and ginseng in it

720
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,120
which can nourish you.

721
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,040
Just taste it.

722
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,275
Master,

723
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:39,840
how’s your wound?

724
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,080
Just a scratch.

725
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:42,800
Master,

726
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,560
Haishi woke up

727
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,800
in the middle of the night

728
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,125
to cook this soup in the kitchen.

729
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:47,600
Yes.

730
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,399
Look at it.

731
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:49,625
It must taste

732
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:50,879
as bad as it looks.

733
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,520
It’s a mess.

734
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,375
Stop it!

735
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,719
That said,

736
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,275
Haishi did try his best

737
00:45:58,275 --> 00:45:59,280
to make it work.

738
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,360
Please at least take a sip.

739
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,900
Master,

740
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,959
would you like a green bean cake?

741
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,399
It helps cleanse your system.

742
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,439
The vegetables are tasty, too.

743
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:16,959
Have a bite.

744
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,600
So?

745
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,639
It’s good.

746
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,679
Zhuoying is off duty today.

747
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,800
Let’s see

748
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,950
how well you’ve learned lately.

749
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,760
Meaning I have to be
his training partner again?

750
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,239
Master,

751
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,320
will I get a post at the Palace

752
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,000
if I pass your test?

753
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,239
So,

754
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,000
how do you want to play?

755
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,919
Shoot three arrows each.

756
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,879
The one with more arrows

757
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,800
on the target will win.

758
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,080
Deal.

759
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:28,840
Yes! Nice! Excellent!

760
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,879
Young Master Haishi nailed it!

761
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:30,399
Agreed.

762
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:31,575
He’s as good as Commander

763
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:32,399
back in the day!

764
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,600
You...

765
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:34,675
You shot my arrow down!

766
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:35,275
Yes.

767
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,479
You didn’t say I couldn’t.

768
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:39,439
Fine.

769
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,159
Shoot again.

770
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,399
Well done! Good job!

771
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,919
He’s good! Yes!

772
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:56,760
Oops. I got yours again.

773
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,475
- Master!
- Master!

774
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:17,679
Commander!

775
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,719
Archery can be taught

776
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,520
but integrity can’t.

777
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,825
Stop wasting time

778
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,080
on beating others with tricks

779
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,199
but practice hard

780
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,760
to win fair and square.

781
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,959
Master...

782
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:29,959
You need more practice.

783
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,450
Hey,

784
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,475
who’s the loser now?

785
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:34,760
Master is telling you

786
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,919
that you aren’t qualified

787
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:36,919
