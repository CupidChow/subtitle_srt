25

Have you found her?

Yes,

27
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:27,900
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:28,839
Where is she?

29
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,839
In the sealed Lord Chang's Mansion.

30
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,399
Dozens of rebels are there, too.

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,160
Secret Force wouldn't dare spook them

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
for the sake of
Consort Shurong and her baby.

33
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,800
They're lying low

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
to protect her

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,199
except for the messenger.

36
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,305
Is she alright?

37
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,080
She seems fine.

38
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:43,279
The bad news is

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,919
her brother, Prince Suolan,

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,119
is with the rebels.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,039
Him?

42
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:53,679
He must've incited

43
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,800
Tang Qianzi to revolt.

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,919
I was wrong

45
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,440
to think he actually

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,559
cared about Tilan.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
Mu Deqing,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,399
go get the horse. I'm getting her out.

49
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't go, Your Majesty!

50
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,000
Get out of my way!

51
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,475
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,240
we don't know how long

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,119
we can guard the Gates.

54
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,875
The Palace is the safest place.

55
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,559
If you leave

56
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,240
and rebels break into the city,

57
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,240
you'll be in danger.

58
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,639
I know how much

59
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,839
you want Consort Shurong back.

60
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,839
Please give me some time.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,080
I promise that I'll get her out.

62
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,440
Commander Chen is right.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,559
You should command Secret Force

65
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,360
and Imperial Guards

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
to defend the Palace

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,080
before reinforcements arrive.

68
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,320
Need you

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,225
tell me all that?

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,950
I can't entrust Tilan's life

71
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,000
to anyone else

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,264
or wait anymore!

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,386
I can't afford to lose my love again.

74
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,289
Mu Deqing,

75
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,080
get me my horse.

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,839
Uh...

77
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,875
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,150
Commander Chen.

79
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

80
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,559
Should anything happen,

81
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,919
the troops

82
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,800
will be under your command.

83
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,279
No one else can know

84
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm out of the Palace.

85
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,800
If you insist on going,

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,320
I'll bring the troops

87
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,600
and go with you.

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
No.

89
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,199
Tang Qianzi owns a large force.

90
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:14,674
Once they charge in,

91
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:16,795
only you can keep the Palace safe.

92
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,640
It'll be more vulnerable if with

93
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,519
fewer troops inside.

94
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,979
I won't force my way in.

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,679
I need 20 elites from the Secret Force

96
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,839
to leave quietly with me.

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
If they could

98
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,040
steal Tilan away from me,

99
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,200
I could also

100
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,675
steal her back.

101
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,160
Yes.

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,679
Follow me

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,079
to leave through the side door.

104
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,850
- Yes!
- Yes!

105
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,480
Your Majesty!

106
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Your Majesty!

107
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:48,775
Your Majesty!

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,799
What are you doing here, Mu Deqing?

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,200
Consort Shurong can't ride

110
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
because of the baby.

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,559
She's going to need

112
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,920
a carriage.

113
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:58,975
Even so,

114
00:04:58,975 --> 00:04:59,825
others can be the driver

115
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:00,545
instead of you.

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,500
Your Majesty!

117
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:05,900
I...

118
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,600
You've been following me around
all these years.

119
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:13,359
It's time to stop.

120
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,799
If I...

121
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,920
Just take

122
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,200
enough money with you

123
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,200
and go back home.

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,119
Your Majesty!

125
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,519
Your Majesty,

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,180
I've been with you for so long

127
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,161
that I no longer have a home

128
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,305
or anywhere else to go.

129
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,569
I'll go wherever you go.

130
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,040
Your Highness,

131
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,175
do you feel uncomfortable?

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,650
Would you like some water?

133
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,760
No.

134
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,279
Yes.

135
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Highness, you can blame me

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,025
or hate me,

137
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,959
but don't hurt yourself.

138
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,000
Bizi,

139
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,799
have you been

140
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,119
sending information back

141
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,519
ever since Father gave you to me?

142
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,839
Yes.

143
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,160
But that's all I've done.

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
I've never tried to harm you.

145
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,519
Didn't you

146
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,839
poison that soup

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,325
back in Yu'an Palace?

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,875
Yes, I did,

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,625
but that wasn't to kill you.

150
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,330
When His Majesty confined us there,

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,675
I could no longer send out messages

152
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,480
and got anxious.

153
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,139
Then I came up with that plan

154
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,359
to make His Majesty scared enough

155
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,839
to move you to another place.

156
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,119
If you were to leave,

157
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,650
you'd bring me with you.

158
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,760
I only poisoned the soup

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,675
after that maid dropped the bowl.

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,519
Your Highness,

161
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,839
I know you no longer believe

162
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,279
a word I say,

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,519
but I've never forgotten

164
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,880
how well you've treated me.

165
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,105
I'm on your side.

166
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,970
I chose to help Prince Suolan

167
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,359
because he said

168
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,600
he'd make you the most powerful woman

169
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,880
in Dazheng.

170
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
I swear I had no idea

171
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,359
that he'd kill others

172
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,575
and hold you hostage.

173
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,740
You're so naive!

174
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,519
Suolan is using me as leverage

175
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,575
to destroy Dazheng!

176
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,679
Your Highness...

177
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,119
Bizi,

178
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,000
do you still

179
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:19,559
listen to me or not?

180
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,050
I do.

181
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,679
Help!

182
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,119
Her Highness is having
severe abdominal pain!

183
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,079
Give me a hand

184
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,300
to carry her to the bed.

185
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,799
Your Majesty!

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,479
You're brave

187
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,575
and smart.

188
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,280
Your Majesty!

189
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,479
Keep it down.

190
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,359
Rebels in the backyard

191
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,375
have been taken care of.

192
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,599
Don't alert those in the front.

193
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,275
I see.

194
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Careful.

195
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,750
Your Majesty,

196
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,359
Suolan is the mastermind.

197
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,675
He's trying to kill you!

198
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,239
Say no more. I already knew.

199
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:19,975
Let's go back now.

200
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,225
Your Highness!

201
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,125
We got stopped by rebels.

202
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:54,840
Are you alright,

203
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,599
Your Highness?

204
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,880
Shi Lin?

205
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,275
You traitor!

206
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,825
How dare you side with rebels!

207
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm from Zhunian.

208
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,240
I've been working undercover for years

209
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,840
for this very day.

210
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,080
You're dethroned.

211
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Your life

212
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,719
will end here and now.

213
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Charge!

214
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,080
Jianming!

215
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,320
Fang Jianming?

216
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,150
You're still alive!

217
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,119
Lord Qinghai...

218
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,880
Your Highness!

219
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,719
- Tilan is in the carriage.
- Your Highness!

220
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,679
I need to take her back.

221
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,599
Go.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll take care of them.

223
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,239
One squad stays with Jianming.

224
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,799
The rest of you, follow me.

225
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,675
Stop them!

226
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:34,840
Don't let the carriage out!

227
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:37,559
Over my

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,159
dead body.

229
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:45,800
Charge!

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,559
Go! Kill him!

231
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,460
Now!

232
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,270
Go!

233
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:01,599
Charge!

234
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,039
Go, go, go!

235
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,300
Go!

236
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,159
This way!

237
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,050
What...?

238
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,375
- Sir.
- Yes?

239
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,336
Come here.

240
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,479
- Uh...
- Sir,

241
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,280
that's the Emperor.

242
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,520
- Sir...
- Your Majesty...

243
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
- Skip the formality.
- Your Majesty...

244
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,559
- The Empress is in labor.
- Oh...

245
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,400
Make some preparations.

246
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,950
Relax. I'm here.

247
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,025
I'll protect you.

248
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,675
Just focus on

249
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,799
getting our baby out.

250
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,825
No,

251
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Your Majesty,

252
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,919
don't worry about me.

253
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,039
You need to go back!

254
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,750
I can't!

255
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,050
I'll live

256
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,960
and die with you!

257
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,039
Your Majesty,

258
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,599
they've followed us here!

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,880
Don't be scared.

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,479
They can't get past me.

261
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,679
Mu Deqing, Bizi!

262
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,640
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

263
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,825
Make sure

264
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,919
Tilan and our baby are safe.

265
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,900
- We will, Your Majesty!
- We will, Your Majesty!

266
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,261
Your Highness!

267
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,400
Emperor Xu,

268
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,151
there you are.

269
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,725
Where's my sister?

270
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,159
Aren't you ashamed

271
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,960
of hurting your own sister?

272
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I didn't hurt her.

273
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,599
I just want you dead.

274
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,679
Stop kidding yourself.

275
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,039
You're possessed

276
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:58,880
by your wild ambition

277
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,575
and greed

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
and you're using Tilan

279
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,239
to pave your way to the throne.

280
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:05,766
I won't allow you

281
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,325
to go anywhere

282
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:08,919
near her.

283
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,719
You think you can stop

284
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
all of us with this little help?

285
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:16,744
Try me.

286
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,919
Sister...

287
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:25,350
Kill them all!

288
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,640
They must all die!

289
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,239
Merciful Buddha.

290
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,640
Merciful Buddha.

291
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,700
Merciful Buddha.

292
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Charge!

293
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,450
Your Majesty!

294
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,239
Your Majesty!

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Your Majesty.

296
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,325
The baby takes after you...

297
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
and me...

298
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,825
Kill Emperor Xu!

299
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,525
Grab my sister and the baby!

300
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,160
Your Majesty!

301
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,199
Sister!

302
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,719
I'll always be here with you

303
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,400
as long as you need me.

304
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,640
Until when?

305
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,275
Until death do us part.

306
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,175
Tilan! Tilan!

307
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,375
Why did you do this?

308
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,325
Tilan...

309
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,900
Xu,

310
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,479
I can't live

311
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,225
without you.

312
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:46,880
Tilan...

313
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,275
My life is worth it

314
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,000
because of you.

315
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,599
Tilan,

316
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,839
you once said

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,880
you'd never leave me alone.

318
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,000
You'd

319
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,400
be with me

320
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,950
until death do us part.

321
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,959
I'm your wife.

322
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,959
I'll follow you

323
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,300
in life and death.

324
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,375
Your Highness!

325
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,725
Your Highness!

326
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:41,400
Your Highness!

327
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
Tilan! Tilan!

328
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,650
Your Highness!

329
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
Fang Jianming!

330
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:06,359
Your Majesty!

331
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,599
Sorry, I'm late.

332
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:09,450
I'm bleeding out

333
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
and dying.

334
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,725
Physician Li...

335
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,160
Physician Li can save you.

336
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,239
You'll be fine.

337
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Let's go!

338
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,760
Jianming,

339
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,925
Tilan just said

340
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,560
she'd die

341
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,680
with me.

342
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,750
She knew my life was ending.

343
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,550
It's time for you to face it.

344
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,439
Xu,

345
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,199
trust me.

346
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,359
Trust me one last time.

347
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,040
I'll go get Physician Li to save you.

348
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm tired.

349
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,425
Let me stop trying this time.

350
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,160
Jianming,

351
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,359
take care of

352
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,675
Dazheng

353
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,175
and our baby.

354
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,950
You must

355
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,090
live on for us.

356
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:37,350
Xu!

357
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,400
Your Majesty!

358
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,560
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty...

359
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,800
Xu,

360
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,199
rest in peace.

361
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,560
You have my word.

362
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,225
That signal!

363
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,200
Look!

364
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,959
Madam Pearl!

365
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,075
It's her!

366
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,920
Pass my order!

367
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,959
Open the Gate!

368
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,719
Charge!

369
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,425
- Yes!
- Yes!

370
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,319
Tang Qianzi,

371
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,359
you can't win.

372
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,560
It's not too late

373
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,760
to stop!

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,079
I won't because I can't.

375
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:45,959
That's it.

376
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,560
Listen up,

377
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,040
your commander, Tang Qianzi,

378
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
has been captured!

379
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,479
Surrender now

380
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,175
in exchange for leniency.

381
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,280
Get down!

382
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,850
Madam, we've heard from the Palace

383
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,175
that rebel Suolan is dead

384
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,119
but Consort Shurong was killed

385
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,560
in the battle.

386
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,150
What?

387
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,375
Tang Qianzi,

388
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
you helped Suolan

389
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,680
murder Tilan

390
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,920
and destroy Tianqi.

391
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
How do you plead?

392
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
No.

393
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,319
She can't be dead.

394
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,079
I don't believe it.

395
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,520
Throw him in prison!

396
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,400
- Yes!
- Yes!

397
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,920
Get up!

398
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,450
Zhenchu.

399
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,000
Tilan...

400
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,820
(Tianqi)

401
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,640
Physician Li,

402
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,425
how's our little prince?

403
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,719
He was born prematurely

404
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,875
with respiratory disorder.

405
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,675
It's congenital.

406
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm afraid...

407
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,431
there's nothing I can do.

408
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,325
What?

409
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,150
Physician Li,

410
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,199
please do something!

411
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:10,560
He's His Majesty

412
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,000
and Consort Shurong's only child!

413
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,640
Please, Physician Li!

414
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
Physician Li,

415
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,325
you're our only hope!

416
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,760
I wish I could help.

417
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:24,040
Poor baby!

418
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,700
Eunuch Mu!

419
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,199
Thank you for winning the battle

420
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,959
and saving Dazheng, Your Highness.

421
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:05,880
Where's His Majesty?

422
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,199
I need to see him.

423
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:07,880
His Majesty...

424
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,040
His Majesty died

425
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:14,536
with Consort Shurong in the battle.

426
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,719
Lord Qinghai asked us to keep it secret

427
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:23,675
before the situation is stabilized.

428
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,596
And to save their son,

429
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,650
Lord Qinghai...

430
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,439
Their son is extremely weak

431
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,030
due to his premature birth.

432
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,760
Lord Qinghai

433
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,680
has decided to be

434
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,079
his Baixi.

435
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,775
Shaozi!

436
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,875
Your Highness,

437
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,900
Lord is waiting for you inside.

438
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,809
It's been

439
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,514
a long night.

440
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,569
I'm glad you're here.

441
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:27,034
Xu said

442
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,640
he was tired

443
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,880
and needed to rest.

444
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,381
We can no longer go back to Yuezhou.

445
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,920
A new-born prince

446
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:58,006
can't manage the court.

447
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,239
He needs someone qualified

448
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,280
to assist him.

449
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,475
I'll stay and help him

450
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,680
as Madam Pearl.

451
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,700
Thank you.

452
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:40,160
On my way back

453
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,280
with Xu and Consort Shurong,

454
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:45,280
I was thinking

455
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:48,796
if you had shown up

456
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,760
in the best years

457
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
of my life,

458
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,096
that would've been great.

459
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,650
I remember

460
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,079
it was in my third year
at Jifeng Pavilion

461
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,359
that I read a book in your study

462
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,800
about Small Thousandfold World,

463
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,959
Medium Thousandfold World

464
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:21,920
and Large Thousandfold World.

465
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,040
The concept is

466
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,920
life is limitless.

467
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,680
The past and the future

468
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,280
overlap and switch from time to time.

469
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,040
We might not know each other

470
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,599
at one point,

471
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,925
but at another point,

472
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,439
I could've been born earlier

473
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,839
into another family

474
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,400
and we had already met.

475
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,860
Really?

476
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,000
Our first encounter could be

477
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
in the Palace

478
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,700
where I accidentally hit you

479
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,599
during the game of pitch-pot.

480
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,550
We could've laughed it off,

481
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,520
but both of us

482
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,079
were too young and proud

483
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,625
to back off.

484
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Sorry.

485
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,000
Hey!

486
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:11,160
Who are you?

487
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,319
You're so rude in the Palace.

488
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,760
Yes! Look what you've done!

489
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,959
I said I'm sorry.

490
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:16,680
Who I am is none of your business.

491
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,280
We'd be like that?

492
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:19,150
Yes.

493
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,190
Of course.

494
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,359
Teenagers are all alike.

495
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:23,880
Then

496
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,250
you got back

497
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,000
at me.

498
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,560
Look who's here!

499
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,800
That rude

500
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,079
tomboy again.

501
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,075
I'm not a tomboy.

502
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,850
My name is Haishi.

503
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,560
"Hai" means sea.

504
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,920
"Shi" means city.

505
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,150
Then what?

506
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,280
Then

507
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,160
we exchanged names

508
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,199
and got to know each other.

509
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,079
And a few years later?

510
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,880
A few years later,

511
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,160
when we became old enough,

512
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,880
we got engaged

513
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,500
and married.

514
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:22,395
Then

515
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:25,839
we had

516
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,199
more than one child

517
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,000
and raised them together.

518
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,350
We were with each other to the end.

519
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:35,933
♪Being with you♪

520
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:40,075
♪My life would be worth it♪

521
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,000
You forgot about Zhuoying.

522
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:43,950
How could I?

523
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,760
I was

524
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,550
older than him.

525
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,880
He could no longer play tricks on me.

526
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,280
I told him to pay respects to me

527
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,450
every morning and night

528
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,550
and call me Mrs. Fang.

Of course, I was pleased.

because

Your Highness,

after Lord of Right Pudun,

merged Left and Right Tribes of Huku,

00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:43,750
took in

578
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,151
other tribes,

579
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
unified the vast Hanzhou

580
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,679
and proclaimed himself Bolaha Khan.

Bolaha.

582
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,350
Good choice.

583
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,025
It refers to the black mane, right?

584
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,040
Yes.

585
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,100
The unified Hanzhou

586
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,040
under his leadership

587
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,439
can benefit Dazheng as well.

588
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,280
Exactly, Your Highness.

589
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,719
Shortly after the unification,

arrived in the capital.

Enclosed was

594
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,175
a letter he wrote

595
00:37:20,175 --> 00:37:21,639
that he specifically asked me

596
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,280
to deliver it to you.

597
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,959
Let me see.

598
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,159
My dear sister, Haishi,

00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,679
how have you been?

600
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,040
I've finally brought Hanzhou together

601
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,959
and become their Khan as Master hoped.

602
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,611
I miss you so much.

603
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,120
Over the years,

604
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,675
you've had Zhunian

605
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,000
send Consort Shurong's mother

606
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,159
to Dazheng to take care of her

607
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,600
and gained support all over the state.

608
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:44,585
Right now,

609
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,479
there isn't much I can do

610
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,600
for you

611
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:48,760
other than

612
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,000
this one little thing in my power.

613
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,520
Huku wishes to be Dazheng's ally.

614
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,040
The two sides separated
by Huangquan Pass

615
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,280
shall follow principles of
non-aggression,

619
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,760
and carry them forward

620
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,950
for generations to come.

621
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,520
Besides,

622
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,840
I have another piece of good news

623
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040
to share with you.

624
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,200
It's really you!

625
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,800
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

626
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,000
Although we didn't
get to see each other,

627
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,159
I was with you the whole time.

628
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,080
You've been with me the whole time.

629
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,650
Yes.

630
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,300
From the very beginning.

631
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,000
It's a long story.

632
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,275
I'll tell you some other time.

633
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,199
No.

634
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,520
Tell me now.

635
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:19,850
Fine.

636
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,500
No problem.

637
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:23,660
(Five Years Later)

638
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,679
Weiyun,

639
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,800
what has Grand Mentor

640
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,360
been teaching you lately?

641
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,479
We've been

642
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:35,639
studying history.

643
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,000
One of the books says

644
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,320
merfolks can be found

645
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,000
in the sea east of Yuezhou,

646
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,175
who are

647
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:44,959
worshiped by people of Leizhou

648
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:46,560
as Dragon Tail.

649
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:48,439
Similarly to fish,

650
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:49,560
they live in the water

651
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,520
but their tears can turn into

652
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:55,125
luminous pearls in wind.

653
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,200
Mother,

654
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,600
I heard Dragon Tail

655
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,760
is godlike.

656
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,719
When you took her

657
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,175
to Tianqi,

658
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,350
those who saw her

659
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:10,275
were brought to their knees.

660
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:13,425
Was that true?

661
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:16,125
Yes.

662
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,439
But the book also says

663
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:20,399
merfolks are protected by sharks

664
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,639
that can bite through boats

665
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,280
once provoked.

666
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
Mother,

667
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,575
weren't you afraid of sharks?

668
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,560
Of course, I was,

669
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:38,575
but to protect the people I love

670
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,280
and to fulfill my duties,

671
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,919
I had to go

672
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,239
despite my fear.

673
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,000
Weiyun,

674
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,725
as the Emperor,

675
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,275
you'll encounter more difficulties

676
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,560
and things

677
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,996
even scarier than sharks,

678
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,600
but you have to

679
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,679
keep your faith strong

680
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,560
and protect your people

681
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,679
like your father did.

682
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:09,975
Mother,

683
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:10,975
those are

684
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,760
the exact words Grand Mentor said.

685
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,475
He said the same thing?

686
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,760
Yes, Mother.

687
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
I'm going

688
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
to see him.

689
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,199
You also enjoy

690
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,639
his lectures, don't you?

691
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,639
Why not join me?

692
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,879
He's teaching you already

693
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,040
despite his condition.

694
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,199
Are you trying to burden him further

695
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,825
by bringing me along?

696
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,199
His health

697
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,080
has always been a priority.

698
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,639
There are physicians

699
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,399
to take his pulse every day.

700
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,840
He's become

701
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,199
much better than a few years ago.
