25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
You are Emperor Xu's Baixi?

26
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,479
Yes.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
You know everything.

28
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:34,725
Is there a problem?

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,360
To cure Dawn Flower poison,

30
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,025
you have to terminate Baixi first.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,000
It requires my blood

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,160
to cure him.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,475
Our blood types might not match.

34
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,125
I cannot cure him now.

35
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,160
It's not a problem at all.

36
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,039
Let's terminate Baixi.

37
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,100
Without Baixi,

38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,199
the blood types will no longer

39
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,199
be a problem.

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,559
Jianming,

41
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,100
I know you have a way to terminate it.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,279
Go get prepared for it.

43
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,119
Let's terminate it tonight.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,925
What are you waiting for?

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,479
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.

46
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,119
Now my wish can finally

47
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,279
come true in advance.

48
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,275
Lang Huan,

49
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,160
can you cure him

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,000
once Baixi is terminated?

51
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:17,679
Yes.

52
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:18,960
Then what are we waiting for?

53
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,600
No rush, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,520
To terminate Baixi,

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,000
we have to wait till the exact time
of the day

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,880
we made Baixi.

57
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,000
We made Baixi

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,720
during the full moon.

59
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,080
We need to wait a little longer.

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,240
I

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,919
also need to make some preparations.

62
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:34,839
Alright.

63
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,250
If there's anything you need,

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,839
just tell Mu Deqing.

65
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:38,750
Mm.

66
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:40,759
Fang Haishi,

67
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,360
I will

68
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,600
give a healthy Fang Jianming
back to you.

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

70
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,800
Xu,

71
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,175
though some have survived

72
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,880
the termination process,

73
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,200
it's still a risky procedure.

74
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:24,799
If we fail,

75
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,799
the emperor will be backfired.

76
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,720
It's far too dangerous.

77
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,239
I'm not absolutely sure I can do it.

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Jianming,

79
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,480
I've been

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,519
in your debt for too long.

81
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,606
I want to live a life without burden.

82
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,440
They're terminating Baixi now.

83
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,959
Let's do this.

84
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:15,959
You'll be hurt.

85
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't worry about me.

86
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,359
I'll be careful.

87
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,250
Mm.

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,679
Let me dress the wound for you.

89
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:48,600
No, thanks.

90
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,119
You...

91
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,559
We merfolks of the deep sea

92
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,200
are unlike you people on land.

93
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,775
After giving blood,

94
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,200
all we need is to sleep for two days

95
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,920
to regain our strength.

96
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,950
Thank you.

97
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,119
Please bear with me a little longer.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,440
I promise I will send you back.

99
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,200
I know you're

100
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
a person of your word.

101
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,480
Don't worry about me.

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,920
Go ahead.

103
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:25,725
Mm.

104
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,399
Haishi.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,600
It's nothing.

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,000
Go now.

107
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,025
Lang Huan,

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
is there something

109
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,900
you didn't tell us
about the detoxification?

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,760
Most people

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
who are poisoned

112
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,839
can be cured

113
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,239
by drinking my blood.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,880
However,

115
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,850
you're from the Fangs of Liushang,

116
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,295
a special bloodline.

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,640
If our blood matches,

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
the poison can be removed.

119
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,760
If not,

120
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,359
my blood will work as an activator

121
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
that kills you faster.

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,679
Exactly as I presumed.

123
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,200
Would you like to find

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,480
other cures?

125
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,775
It's too late.

126
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,399
In the past two days,

127
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,040
luminous pearls could no longer contain

128
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,359
the poison in my body.

129
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,760
His Majesty and Haishi

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
have high hopes

131
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,900
for this cure.

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,079
I don't want to let them down.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Even if it's a 50-50 chance,

134
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,880
I'd like to take it.

135
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,280
I can't

136
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,950
allow Dawn Flower

137
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,480
to take my life, can I?

138
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,250
It's...

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,625
Your Highness.

140
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,175
They're still in?

141
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

142
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
It's been more than an hour.

143
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Why hasn't it...?

144
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,760
The wait is agony.

145
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,559
They're going to be fine.

146
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,625
Don't worry.

147
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,675
All right.

148
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,679
Did it work?

149
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,285
Jianming.

150
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,039
I can feel the pain.

151
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,919
I'm bleeding now.

152
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,100
Look.

153
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,039
Your Majesty,

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,119
are you alright?

155
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:33,675
Mu Deqing,

156
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,039
punch me.

157
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,136
Huh?

158
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,309
I order you to punch me.

159
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:39,400
Your Majesty, I...

160
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,925
Come on!

161
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:41,280
Well...

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,325
Well...

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
As you wish.

164
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,395
Punch me.

165
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:50,425
I...

166
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,119
Come on!

167
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,080
Yes.

168
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Yes,

169
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,599
Your Majesty!

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,075
Pardon me.

171
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,679
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

172
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,175
- Please forgive me!
- Get up.

173
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,119
What is this?

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Lang Huan's blood?

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,725
What are we waiting for?

176
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,919
Get inside.

177
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,760
Give it to Jianming.

178
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:20,919
Let's get in.

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,239
Lang Huan told me that day

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,919
that my blood is special.

181
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,200
When I take her blood,

182
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:34,400
it might

183
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,679
cure the Dawn Flower poison,

184
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,119
and it also might

185
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,239
result in rejection,

186
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,679
which will kill me.

187
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,159
Xu,

188
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,275
since we terminated Baixi,

189
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,559
my life has been taken

190
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,080
in my own hands.

191
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,320
You don't owe me anything.

192
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:57,880
Haishi,

193
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,520
I didn't keep it from you this time.

194
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,440
But forgive me

195
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,479
for making you worry again.

196
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,159
Perhaps...

197
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,000
Perhaps we can find other cures

198
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
for the poison.

199
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,799
It's alright.

200
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,159
Trust me.

201
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,000
Master!

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,559
Jianming!

203
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,200
I'll send for the physicians.

204
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,975
Master!

205
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,239
Master!

206
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:28,039
Can you read a few hymns to me?

207
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,600
Hymns?

208
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,450
Hymns.

209
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,350
Why don't I read some poems

210
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,475
you taught me before?

211
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,350
High are the mountains,

212
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:51,640
and small is the moon.

213
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,320
Small, but shining pure.

214
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,640
My mind goes far away to someone.

215
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,280
A day without him

216
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:00,119
would upset me so.

217
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:04,924
Two geese used to migrate in a pair

218
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,799
each spring and each autumn.

219
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,080
How happy the couple was!

220
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,520
But parting is more unforgettable.

221
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Their love is deeper than human love.

222
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:19,080
You...

223
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,119
You must want to say,

224
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:26,265
"Though clouds at great heights

225
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,944
and snow-capped mountains
are magnificent..."

226
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,994
"What is the point
of going without you?"

227
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,601
Wherever you go from now on,

228
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,275
I'll follow.

229
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:39,875
Mm!

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,775
Master!

231
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,880
Master!

232
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,750
(Notice: The sea and the land are at peace,
but some rebels defy the sovereign.)

233
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,925
(Lord Qinghai exerted himself to suppression
and died of a pre-existing affliction.)

234
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:04,520
What does it say?

235
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,159
The sea and the land

236
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,440
are at peace,

237
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,840
but some rebels

238
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,880
defy the sovereign.

239
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:11,799
(Tianqi)
Lord Qinghai exerted himself

240
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,679
to suppression,

241
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,960
and died

242
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,599
of a pre-existing affliction.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
The end.

244
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,510
What?

245
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,400
Lord Qinghai is dead.

246
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,400
Lord Qinghai passed away.

247
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,640
It can't be true.

248
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,550
How did it happen?

249
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,200
Right.

250
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
He was a good man.

251
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,425
What a pity!

252
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,450
How did he die?

253
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,200
Yes.

254
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,381
It's a pity.

255
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,800
(Tianqi)

256
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,440
Your Majesty,

257
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,159
Lord Qinghai was a faithful servant

258
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,239
of Dazheng.

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,559
Now he died of fatigue from work,

260
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:42,080
and set a great example for us.

261
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,840
I suggest that Your Majesty

262
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,925
give him a posthumous promotion

263
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,599
and a title.

264
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,025
- I agree.
- I agree.

265
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,855
Read my edict.

266
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes.

267
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,679
His Majesty's edict,

268
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,000
this brave general was born

269
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,559
upon a celestial sign.

270
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,739
He died

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
as a faithful follower.

272
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,799
Therefore, he's a great help
to the state

273
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,119
and its revitalization.

274
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:22,735
The late Lord Qinghai, Fang Zhu,

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,525
assisted in a great cause
and loved the people.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,559
He was a lonely role model.

277
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,880
For the state and his emperor,

278
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,640
he braved risks and danger.

279
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,715
For the right cause,

280
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,400
he wouldn't mind
offending the sovereign.

281
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,250
His story will be remembered

282
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,250
and his spirit will be honored.

283
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,840
His death

284
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,200
is a painful loss.

285
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:52,960
I hereby confer on him Duke of Liushang,

286
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,239
and the title, Jingyi (powerful wings)

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,239
in honor of his feat.

288
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,280
A memorial tablet made of dark granite

289
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,435
will be placed in the shrine.

290
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,760
The court will be suspended
for three days.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,479
The army and people of Liushang will
have 100-day mourning.

292
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
His funeral

293
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,080
follows the rituals of a prince.

294
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,719
All officials should mourn.

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,719
No one should disobey my order.

296
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,440
Respect this.

297
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,550
- Hail Your Majesty!
- Hail Your Majesty!

298
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,000
(Zhaoming Palace)

299
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,775
Greetings to Your Highness.

300
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,679
What are you...?

301
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Lord is gone.

302
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,525
Jifeng Pavilion should no long occupy
Zhaoming Palace.

303
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,239
His Majesty has permitted us

304
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,320
to move back to our former residence.

305
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,559
May I get in and look around?

306
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
Please, Your Highness.

307
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,079
- Greetings to Your Highness.
- Greetings to Your Highness.

308
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,775
How is he?

309
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
Your Majesty,

310
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,194
Lord Qinghai is stable now.

311
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,040
But I've never seen

312
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,950
such a miraculous thing.

313
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,550
Just tell me how he is.

314
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,325
Now,

315
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Lord Qinghai's body

316
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
is poison-free.

317
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
What's more, the pre-existing wounds

318
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
and damage

319
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,000
are all gone.

320
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,350
From now on,

321
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,425
as long as he's not wounded again,

322
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,900
or doesn't have any accidents,

323
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,760
it's totally possible for him

324
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,079
to grow 100 years old.

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,650
The merfolk's blood

326
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,200
is truly a panacea.

327
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,239
Good.

328
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,280
In that case,

329
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,225
you can go and have a rest.

330
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,160
But remember.

331
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,520
Don't tell anyone else

332
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,760
about what has happened

333
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,280
since last night.

334
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,239
If anyone asks about it,

335
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:11,400
tell them

336
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,160
Lord Qinghai died last night

337
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,280
of long-term fatigue.

338
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

339
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,760
Fang Haishi,

340
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,479
we can't miss

341
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,719
such a great opportunity.

342
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:33,680
It's time

343
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,319
to announce Lord Qinghai's death.

344
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,800
Give it to me.

345
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,079
You may leave.

346
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,400
Do not come in

347
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
without my order.

348
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,319
Yes.

349
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,550
His Majesty

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,050
made you a duke

351
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,250
and gave you
the posthumous title, Jingyi.

352
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,319
Your memorial tablet
made of dark granite

353
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,199
will be put in Fang's Family Shrine
in Liushang.

354
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,920
Jifeng Pavilion has moved
to its former residence.

355
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,400
I went to Zhaoming Palace today.

356
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,825
All I ever wanted to do was

357
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,160
to spend the rest of my life

358
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,825
with you at leisure.

359
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,599
I was so selfish before.

360
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,640
I didn't realize until today

361
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,119
that you're

362
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,280
no longer

363
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,200
Lord Qinghai of Liushang,

364
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,675
and you can no longer command

365
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:06,950
the Secret Force of Jifeng Pavilion.

366
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,375
What's worse,

367
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,350
you can never go back to the shrine

368
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,760
to worship your ancestors.

369
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
You've sacrificed

370
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,479
so much for me.

371
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,239
Don't feel guilty about it.

372
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,280
I refused to let go in the past

373
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:27,479
because I wanted to atone

374
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:28,959
for the mistakes I made.

375
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,000
Without you,

376
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,725
His Majesty and I

377
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:38,400
would be stuck with each other,

378
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:42,439
and lead a life that has no end.

379
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,319
But after you came into my life,

380
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,400
I realized

381
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,325
there are other options in my life.

382
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,625
I've never tried to relax

383
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,900
and enjoy as much as I do now.

384
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,040
So don't feel guilty about it.

385
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,250
Think about

386
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,359
where you want to go
and what you want to do

387
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,280
after we send Lang Huan

388
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,525
back to Yuezhou.

389
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,599
Take this.

390
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,475
His Majesty is highly efficient.

391
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,640
He's made household registers for us

392
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,560
at Yuezhou Prefect's Office.

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,275
He also gave us a pass,

394
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,119
so we can travel around.

395
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,000
Great.

396
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,439
I need this to hide out there.

397
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,675
(Ji Zhu, from Linjie County, Yuezhou...)

398
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,520
From now on, my surname is Ji.

399
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,350
His Majesty said

400
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Jifeng Flower has been your favorite.

401
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,375
So,

402
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,160
"Ji" is the best surname for you.

403
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:50,280
Alright.

404
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,560
Didn't you want to know

405
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,475
what I want to do

406
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,880
after we send Lang Huan back?

407
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,650
Actually,

408
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,239
I had an answer long ago.

409
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
What do you want to do?

410
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,599
Well, I

411
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,700
want to find

412
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,640
a suitable house in Yuezhou

413
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,680
and settle down.

414
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,640
If there's a chance,

415
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,119
I'd also like to see the world's
great landscape.

416
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,400
But,

417
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
first I need a home

418
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,680
where I can go back.

419
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,725
Sure.

420
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,925
How do you like

421
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,959
a house by the sea?

422
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,000
When we're at leisure,

423
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,319
we can go beachcombing.

424
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:32,600
We can also make our yard

425
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,239
a garden.

426
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,319
Whatever you want to do,

427
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,560
I'll do it with you.

428
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,719
The rest of Zhaoming Palace

429
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,100
has been emptied.

430
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,880
Only your chamber

431
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,079
is left untouched.

432
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:56,435
Did you hide some treasures here?

433
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,839
So you sneaked back

434
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,625
to pack up yourself.

435
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:01,959
Your Majesty has been here for a while.

436
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,560
Is there nothing to do today?

437
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm in mourning.

438
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,319
I'm here

439
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,959
so no one will come in,

440
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,800
and you can pack up with peace of mind.

441
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,616
Besides, after you leave,

442
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,289
I'll have to do everything myself,

443
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,439
including the command
of Jifeng Pavilion.

444
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,599
The easy life is gone.

445
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,699
I have to cherish each day
with you around.

446
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,560
I read the route

447
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,350
to send Lang Huan back.

448
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,500
You're still so prudent.

449
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,199
It's a well-planned route.

450
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,520
Haishi planned the route.

451
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,280
She said the departure is imminent,

452
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,319
and she has to

453
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,719
make a precise plan for it.

454
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,040
Where is Fang Haishi?

455
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,119
She's gone to see Tilan?

456
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,025
Yes.

457
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,500
Did you tell her

458
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,119
not to say anything sad?

459
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,040
Tilan is pregnant now.

460
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,199
She mustn't get emotional.

461
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,959
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

462
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,675
She knows what she should say.

463
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,760
(Destined Match)
What's in this

464
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,079
that gives my Lord Qinghai

465
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,199
such a bright smile?

466
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,350
(Fang Jianming and Ye Haishi are in for
an eternal marriage.)

467
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
A marriage certificate?

468
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
When I was announced dead,

469
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,199
I couldn't take these with me.

470
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,479
So today I come back to get them.

471
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,850
(Fang)
I remember

472
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,255
the first time I saw this sachet,

473
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,359
I thought Fabric Office made it.

474
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,760
Now it seems

475
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,000
it can only be made by Fang Haishi.

476
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,860
She's terrible at needlework.

477
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,375
(Fang)

478
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,200
But you and I

479
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,625
won't be able to meet frequently.

480
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,959
Knowing that

481
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,959
someone will make things for you

482
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:57,884
and manage your life,

483
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,359
I'm relieved.

484
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,079
Xu,

485
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,599
after I leave the capital...

486
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:13,719
Alright, say no more.

487
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,400
I understand.

488
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:22,275
It's not like we'll never meet again.

489
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,575
Three or five years later,

490
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:25,735
when the people

491
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,280
have forgotten about you two,

492
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,550
I can go on a private tour

493
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,831
to visit you.

494
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,800
Sure.

495
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,800
I thought I could be with you

496
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:48,920
in childbirth

497
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,599
and take care of the baby
for a few years.

498
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,800
However,

499
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm leaving tomorrow.

500
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,706
Sending Dragon Tail back to the sea
is more urgent.

501
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
Without Dragon Tail,

502
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,959
sharks will harass the sea.

503
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,850
People living along the coast

504
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,880
will have no peace.

505
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,479
Haishi,

506
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,880
I know you won't come back

507
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,800
after you leave

508
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,119
and I'll never see you again.

509
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,735
I'll miss you.

510
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,800
But you and he...

511
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,439
I'm so happy

512
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,599
that your dream comes true.

513
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,675
Thank you.

514
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,040
I want you to have this.

515
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,925
May it keep you safe.

516
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
It's beautiful.

517
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,280
Since His Majesty said you're leaving,

518
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,600
I've been working on it.

519
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,719
Glad that I made it in time
to give it to you.

520
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,439
I'll take good care of it

521
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,040
as my family's heirloom.

522
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,160
Even if I won't

523
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,280
see you again for the rest of my life,

524
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,839
you'll always be

525
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,179
the best friend of mine.

526
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,119
Rest assured.

527
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,160
I will

528
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,479
find a chance to come back to see you

529
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,400
and this little one.

530
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,325
Will you?

531
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:22,975
Mm.

532
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,079
His Majesty's edict,

533
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,839
Madam Pearl is ordered

534
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,040
to escort Dragon Tail back

535
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,040
who'll bring peace to the seas

536
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,599
and bless us with fair weather,

537
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,959
good crop

538
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,560
and harvest,

539
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,000
and prosperity for the people.

540
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
Respect this.

541
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:06,760
- Long live the Emperor!
- Long live the Emperor!

542
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,719
- Long live
- Long live

543
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:12,200
- Madam Pearl!
- Madam Pearl!

544
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,880
Madam Pearl,

545
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,459
I'm counting on you.

546
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
I will send Dragon Tail back

547
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,119
safe and sound
as Your Majesty's command.

548
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,040
Haishi

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,280
is about to leave, right?

550
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,079
Yes.

551
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,760
His Majesty is seeing

552
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,959
Consort Chunrong's procession off.

553
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,560
(Haishi,)

554
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,359
(take care.)

555
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,319
(May we meet again.)

556
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,280
(Tianqi City has witnessed)

557
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,025
(my growth.)

558
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
(After I leave today,)

559
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,850
(I'm afraid I won't come back again.)

560
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,700
(For the years to come,)

561
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,800
(there will be no Fang Haishi)

562
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
(or Fang Jianming in this world.)

563
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,599
(Take care, Tilan.)

564
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,319
(Take care, Your Majesty.)

565
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,250
(Tianqi)

566
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,175
Was Your Majesty

567
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,800
missing Lord Qinghai?

568
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:42,400
Yes.

569
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,959
I was recalling

570
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:49,405
the past we've been through.

571
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,479
Do you know, Tilan?

572
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,550
The emperor

573
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,450
is the most bored

574
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,550
and tired person in the world.

575
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,479
The livelihood of the people,

576
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,199
the result of the war,

577
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,319
the power struggle and betrayal
in court,

578
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:17,959
and all sorts of trouble

579
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,479
that you cannot imagine

580
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,800
are all the emperor's responsibility.

581
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:26,325
As the emperor,

582
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,525
I can't afford to be afraid,

583
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,479
to escape,

584
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,439
to lose,

585
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:34,565
or even to die.

586
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm surprised

587
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
I've been sticking to it till now.

588
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,950
I owe it

589
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,359
to Jianming's company.

590
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,640
He went to war on my behalf.

591
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,319
He'd rather take the blame and harm

592
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,600
for me,

593
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,280
and hurt himself

594
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,199
than let harm come to me.

595
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,040
He's just like

596
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,199
another me.

597
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,479
Now that he's gone, I...

598
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,640
Something

599
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,479
is missing in my heart.

600
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,800
If Your Majesty doesn't want him to go,

601
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,239
why not find a way

602
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,560
to keep him around?

603
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,280
Because I want him to be happy

604
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,500
and to spend the rest of his life

605
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,860
as a free man.

606
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,950
It was both my and Jianming's dream.

607
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm thinking

608
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,959
one of us

609
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,640
has to

610
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,359
fulfill this dream.

611
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:45,760
Your Majesty

612
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,199
is such a kind man.

613
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:50,560
Heaven will bless Your Majesty

614
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,200
with peace

615
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,079
in the coming years.

616
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,599
Though the baby and I

617
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,439
cannot replace Lord Qinghai,

618
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:01,760
we'll always be here

619
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,959
with Your Majesty.

620
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,619
You

621
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,750
and the baby

622
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,270
are all I want in my life.

623
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,350
I saw you were sad when you left Tianqi.

624
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,959
Didn't want to leave?

625
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,425
Sort of.

626
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,950
That's unexpected.

627
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,300
When I sent you to the Palace,

628
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,040
you cried so sadly.

629
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,879
Now that you can get rid of the title,

630
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,175
you feel reluctant.

631
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,399
What are you talking about?

632
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,679
Here you go.

633
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,000
Where did you get these?

634
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,025
I thought you might want to eat it
on the way,

635
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
so I bought some for you.

636
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,520
Don't you like it?

637
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,225
I want to

638
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,719
take it to Yuezhou.

639
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,439
You can eat it now.

640
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,919
I'm afraid that there isn't

641
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,399
a store in Yuezhou

642
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,360
that sells this candy.

643
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,959
Their business is great.

644
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,959
Its owner has opened up

645
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,040
a branch in Yuezhou.

646
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,399
Not only the candy store,

647
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,879
but also your favorite
Huixian Restaurant.

648
00:35:58,879 --> 00:35:59,639
And

649
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,159
your favorite tavern,

650
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,840
the accessory store in the West Market,

651
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,439
and the silk store.

652
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,875
You can buy all of them in Yuezhou.

653
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,840
If I miss anything, give me a tip.

654
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,750
The kind owner

655
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,520
will open up a branch in Yuezhou.

656
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,650
Does the kind owner

657
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
happen to be you?

658
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,325
Mm.

659
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,879
You own all the stores?

660
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,000
And more.

661
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,399
I bought all the stores

662
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,560
as Mr. Ji.

663
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,560
I've also been managing farmsteads,

664
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,959
stores, gold and iron mines

665
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,120
for years

666
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,320
in other identities.

667
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,360
If you would like to take over,

668
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,439
I'll hand them over to you

669
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,760
as my betrothal presents.

670
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,959
Fang Jianming,

671
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,840
how much more about you is there

672
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
that I don't know?

673
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,225
There's a lot more.

674
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,040
I have plenty of time to tell you.

675
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,080
I thought

676
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,450
one day

677
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,120
when we're no longer Lord Qinghai

678
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,919
and Consort Chunrong,

679
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,080
I wouldn't mind living a life

680
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,080
that we could barely make ends meet.

681
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,900
I would.

682
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:19,925
Zhou Youdu owns

683
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,800
all the stores along a street.

684
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,560
He bought you drinks,

685
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,239
gave you gifts

686
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,439
and hired acrobats

687
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,000
to please you.

688
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm perfectly capable

689
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,239
of whatever he can do.

690
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,750
In addition,

691
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,479
I will strive for perfection.

692
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,679
I knew

693
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,919
you were a man

694
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,040
who wanted to be the best in everything.

695
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,750
I can't believe

696
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,479
you're competing with Zhou Youdu now.

697
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,150
I don't even remember

698
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,800
those things you just said.

699
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:53,520
Never mind.

700
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:55,159
I just want you to be happy.

701
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,760
Surely I'm happy

702
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,700
for what you did for me.

703
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,959
Well, I'm not talking

704
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,040
about your fortune.

705
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,875
The thing is,

706
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,360
since the first time we met,

707
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:12,120
you've been as serious

708
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,399
as a golden statue of the Buddha.

709
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,239
But today...

710
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,050
Today,

711
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,879
I met the capricious

712
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,360
and carefree man

713
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,000
His Majesty described.

714
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,120
Free from the burdensome

715
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,239
responsibility,

716
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,879
you and the childe you used to be

717
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:29,760
have no difference

718
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,479
in personality.

719
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,760
Promise me

720
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,520
that you'll be carefree

721
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,275
as you are now, all right?

722
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,239
I like you

723
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,280
this way.

724
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:50,360
Sure.

725
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,320
Sister.

726
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,239
Suolan.

727
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,479
Sister.

728
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,350
His Majesty finally allowed me
to visit you.

729
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,479
He also told me

730
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,520
that you're pregnant.

731
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,625
I'm overjoyed.

732
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,575
Come in.

733
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,750
Sister.

734
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,639
Look.

735
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,950
Do you like this?

736
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,399
The baby is so cute.

737
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,280
Your Highness is so thoughtful.

738
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,300
If I'd known you were pregnant,

739
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,679
I would have asked
renowned Zhunian artists

740
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,239
to paint it for you.

741
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,280
But here in Tianqi,

742
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,879
I'm a stranger.

743
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:34,439
And I can't leave my residence at will.

744
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
So I painted it for you.

745
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,950
It's excellent.

746
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,800
I can tell that you put in
a lot of effort.

747
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,850
I like it very much.

748
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,520
It's said if a mother-to-be

749
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,399
can see beautiful babies often,

750
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,800
her baby will also be beautiful.

751
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,439
I've spent

752
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,560
a lot of effort

753
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,840
for my unborn nephew.

754
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,239
I drew the outline

755
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,679
through referring to Dragon Tail,

756
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,800
and colored it with paints

757
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,841
blended with gold powder.

758
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,199
It took me great effort

759
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,320
to finish the painting.

760
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,000
Luckily, you're in Tianqi now.

761
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,225
If Father finds out,

762
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:08,239
you'll get a reprimand
for being frivolous.

763
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,750
Your Highness,

764
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,839
Prince Suolan has a good reputation

765
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,239
in Zhunian.

766
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,825
I guess the King won't

767
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:16,239
scold him as he used to.

768
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,850
I'll take the painting.

769
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,525
Mm.

770
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:21,535
Come and sit down.

771
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:22,150
Sure.

772
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,479
Last year, Father allowed me
to handle tribal affairs.

773
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,695
I'm doing well.

774
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,560
I will become

775
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,439
an accomplished man,

776
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,000
and I'll be a strong support

777
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
for my nephew in the future.

778
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,120
Am I right, my nephew?

779
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,800
How do you know it's a boy?

780
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,425
Maybe it's a girl.

781
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,520
A niece is also great.

782
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,050
I'll protect

783
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,520
all your children.

784
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,000
Sister,

785
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,600
I've been trying to meet you

786
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,250
since I came to Tianqi,

787
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,840
because I'm worried about you.

788
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,760
I heard...

789
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:59,325
I heard His Majesty dislikes you,

790
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,925
and often puts you under house arrest,

791
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,405
even now that you're pregnant.

792
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,439
How has he been to you?

793
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,840
His Majesty has been kind to me.

794
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,496
Rest assured.

795
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,500
This is his first child,

796
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,639
so he's particularly prudent.

797
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,875
So far,

798
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,879
few people know I'm pregnant.

799
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,360
It's right to be careful.

800
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,825
I'll keep it a secret too.

801
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,399
After all,

802
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,919
he might be the heir

803
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,280
to the throne of Dazheng.

804
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,760
By the way, Sister,

805
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,120
I want to

806
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,719
take this opportunity

807
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:35,719
to tell you something.

808
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,320
Zhunian has been
in an enfeebled position

809
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,840
and depending on Dazheng's support.

810
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,959
But however generous
Dazheng's emperor is,

811
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,959
it's not a long-term plan for Zhunian.

812
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:46,800
If we cannot achieve independence,

813
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,280
Zhunian will never hold a firm position

814
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
in Leizhou,

815
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,320
and will be bullied.

816
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,560
I know it well.

817
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:55,585
So,

818
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,200
I will no longer force you

819
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,120
to ask His Majesty

820
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:00,919
for anything on Zhunian's behalf.

821
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,639
Suolan.

822
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,679
You're all alone

823
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,250
in the palace of Dazheng

824
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,199
far away from home.

825
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,280
Even though His Majesty is kind to you,

826
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,679
life will not be easy for you.

827
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,840
So in the future,

828
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,314
I'll make Zhunian powerful and strong

829
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,600
and be your support.

830
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,900
I have a good brother.

831
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:36,959
Lang Huan,

832
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,800
you can finally go back home.

833
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,800
After we part,

834
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,919
I don't know when I'll see you again.

835
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:43,159
Take care of yourself.

836
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,800
Mm.

837
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:57,199
You two...

838
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,400
I'm going to

839
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
settle down by the sea.

840
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,125
On sunny days,

841
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:05,320
I'll come back to see you.

842
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,100
I'll be waiting for you.

843
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,175
