25
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,039
Tribal envoys from Leizhou and West Land

26
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,720
have arrived in Tianqi City.

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,679
What do you think

28
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,350
is the purpose of their trip?

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,679
To ask for an explanation.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,559
They’ve come at a good time.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,080
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
(Jincheng Palace)

33
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,160
Your Majesty,

34
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,500
special envoys from Nihualuo and Zhunian

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,981
are waiting in the side hall.

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,119
And...

37
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,085
Out with it.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,525
Lord Qinghai.

39
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,700
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,360
I’ll go meet the envoys first.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,525
After you handle things with Eunuch Mu,

42
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,875
you can meet us at the side hall.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Go ahead.

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,919
See you.

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,720
You can speak.

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,520
Physician Li is waiting
outside the hall.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,525
He has an urgent business to report.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,900
Jianming doesn’t know you’re here.

49
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,050
Is his condition worsening?

50
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,759
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,800
when I checked his pulse yesterday,

52
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,775
I found the poison in his body

53
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,240
hadn’t been contained.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Instead,
it’s infiltrating into his blood

55
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
day by day.

56
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,240
Although Lord Qinghai seems

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,160
nothing wrong at all,

58
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,440
the toxins in his body are only

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,160
blocked by the pearl powder.

60
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,786
In time

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
when we run out of pearl powder

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
or if the pearl powder

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
cannot block the toxins any longer,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,160
I’m afraid

65
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:52,240
Lord Qinghai will collapse.

66
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,399
By then,

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,839
even the immortals, if there is one,

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,839
may...

69
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,000
may not save him.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,039
What?

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,575
In the presence of Lord Qinghai,

72
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,360
I...

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,960
don’t have the heart to tell the truth.

74
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,479
But I cannot

75
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,919
keep it from Your Majesty.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,480
How much time does he have?

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,600
Judging from his current condition,

78
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,155
the day we run out of pearl powder

79
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,760
will be the day

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,720
when Lord Qinghai collapses.

81
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,760
So far,

82
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,109
our only hope is the merfolk.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Perhaps,

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,799
they can save his life.

85
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,320
Your Majesty, Consort Chunrong is here.

86
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,279
Send her in.

87
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:04,679
Yes.

88
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,185
You may leave.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,961
Yes.

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,959
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,175
You may rise.

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,575
What is it?

93
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,079
There are two things I want to discuss.

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,200
First, the gold price.

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,959
So?

96
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,920
You also think

97
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
that I have too much gold,

98
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,160
so I make light of it.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,440
I dare not speculate.

100
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,359
I’m just worried about

101
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:56,650
a potential conflict with the southwest.

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,920
You want to help me with it?

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,559
Since Your Majesty gave me

104
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,519
the Imperial Inspector’s Seal,

105
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,591
I can’t turn a deaf ear to an issue

106
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,119
that will affect
livelihood and stability.

107
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,480
Alright.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,875
I do need your help.

109
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
Come with me

110
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,575
to meet the envoys.

111
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,679
Yes.

112
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,399
We’ve waited too long.

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,200
His Majesty is busy.

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,575
Please be a little more patient.

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,760
If the Emperor of Dazheng

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,801
does not intend to talk with us,

117
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,679
he could have been frank

118
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,239
and turned us down.

119
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,586
He summoned us

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,975
and gave us cold shoulders.

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,519
Are you insulting Nihualuo

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,440
because we’re a small tribe?

123
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Nihualuo

124
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,959
is warm and vast,

125
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,559
where triple cropping applies
to bean and wheat.

126
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,880
Neighboring tribes including Tuhuolu,

127
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,320
and Xifu all depend on you.

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Don’t make light of yourself,
Your Excellency.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

130
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,079
- Madam Pearl.
- Your Highness.

131
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,790
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

132
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,600
All rise.

133
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,640
Is this Madam Pearl?

134
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,925
Exactly.

135
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,760
Thanks to Her Highness,

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,640
the southwest

137
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,040
survived the drought and famine.

138
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,839
- Greetings, Madam Pearl.
- Greetings, Madam Pearl.

139
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,880
As a consort in my palace,

140
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,160
she shouldn’t have met you.

141
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,950
But tribes in Leizhou

142
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,799
are all Dragon Tail’s believers.

143
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,519
So I take Madam Pearl here

144
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,900
to welcome you all

145
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,480
as a small gesture.

146
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,160
Thank you for your hospitality.

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,559
But we’re here

148
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,440
to discuss an urgent issue

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,200
with Your Majesty.

150
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Dazheng sold off gold

151
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,239
in its Treasury with complete disregard

152
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,399
for a slump in the gold price.

153
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:58,880
In just a few months,

154
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,119
the gold price has fallen

155
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,440
to its bottom of all times.

156
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,925
The gold in the treasuries

157
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:03,720
of more than ten tribes

158
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,279
on West Land and the South

159
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,519
has devalued by half.

160
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,440
Is that all?

161
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,160
Is this

162
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,559
the purpose of this collective visit?

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,640
Your Majesty,

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,399
gold traders from Nihualuo

165
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,399
and other tribes on West Land

166
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,480
have all suffered a great loss.

167
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,825
In the past few months,

168
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,664
many have killed themselves.

169
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,320
It’s become the talk of West Land.

170
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,300
Men and women of all ages

171
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,701
are outraged.

172
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,920
The sea is now facing the monsoon.

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Most of the tribes on the West Land

174
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,839
cannot come with us.

175
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,550
But Nihualuo

176
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,000
and Zhunian are located in its south.

177
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,050
Our kings couldn’t bear it,

178
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,880
and ordered us

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,125
to take the victims’ families to Tianqi

180
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,011
for justice

181
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,450
from Your Majesty.

182
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,950
Your Majesty,

183
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,575
as the Special Envoy of Nihualuo,

184
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:53,534
Mr. Bonen Naji said,

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,125
Zhunian

186
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:58,925
is also the victim of the plunge
in gold price.

187
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,799
There’s a public panic.

188
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,800
The people

189
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,625
cannot make a living.

190
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,119
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,599
for the sake of Consort Shurong,

192
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,325
I humbly ask

193
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,484
for your generosity.

194
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,760
Mr. Bonen Naji,

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,850
I learned that Dragon Tail

196
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,300
is the supreme god of your tribe,

197
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,900
and is considered auspicious,

198
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,075
just like the legendary

199
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:31,794
Heavenly Dragon in Zhongzhou.

200
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,320
Is it true?

201
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,960
Yes, it is.

202
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Your Excellency,

203
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,119
have you ever seen Dragon Tail?

204
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,159
Most people do not have the honor

205
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,100
to see Dragon Tail.

206
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,400
One must be very fortunate

207
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:45,845
to be able to see it.

208
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,250
As a humble man,

209
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,740
I haven’t had the honor.

210
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,825
You haven’t?

211
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,679
Good.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
In the summer

213
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,625
when envoys from all tribes gather
in Tianqi,

214
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,559
you’re welcome to come to the palace

215
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,039
and meet Dragon Tail.

216
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,719
Your Majesty,

217
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:08,039
Dragon Tail is a god

218
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,880
of supremacy.

219
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
To meet a god is a matter of chance
rather than choice.

220
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,640
How could a god
be confined in the palace?

221
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,119
It’s a sign
of great prosperity of Dazheng

222
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,840
that we can serve a god in the palace.

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,359
Your Excellency,

224
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,025
are you questioning

225
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,400
the prosperity of Dazheng?

226
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,300
I wouldn’t dare to.

227
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,719
I will come in the summer

228
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:32,840
with congratulations.

229
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,239
Fang Haishi,

230
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,840
you have a lot of nerve!

231
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,520
I’ve just given you a place
in state governance.

232
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,479
How dare you challenge my decision now!

233
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,280
Your Majesty,

234
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
I will accept

235
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
all your punishment.

236
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,420
As for Lang Huan,

237
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
I cannot

238
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,840
bring her to Tianqi.

239
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,679
Now you disobey my direct order.

240
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,840
Dragon Tail doesn’t exist.

241
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,760
In Leizhou

242
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,119
and the southwest,

243
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,919
people call the merfolk

244
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,725
Dragon Tail,

245
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,559
because the merfolks drive sharks away

246
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,679
and protect sailors on the sea.

247
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,520
But they’re not gods.

248
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,925
They’re just creatures

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,799
living in the ocean,

250
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,599
just like us living on land.

251
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:14,960
The merfolk cannot survive

252
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,159
out of the sea.

253
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,919
Has it ever occurred to Your Majesty

254
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
if in the summer

255
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,775
Lang Huan dies unfortunately

256
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,400
on the way to Tianqi,

257
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,300
Your Majesty,

258
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,625
how should we explain to the envoys?

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,250
I’ve made a promise.

260
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,679
So I’ll have skilled craftsmen

261
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,625
build a livable dwelling

262
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,200
and transport her here

263
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,880
in a large amount of seawater.

264
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,280
As long as Lang Huan stays in seawater,

265
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,679
nothing will go wrong.

266
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,679
I think

267
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,239
it’s too risky.

268
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,325
A tiny slip

269
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,046
could endanger Lang Huan’s life.

270
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,599
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

271
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,719
A ruler does not take back his words.

272
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Fang Haishi,

273
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,280
you’ve been preaching how much

274
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
you will do for Dazheng.

275
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,975
Now you’re refusing
to perform your duty.

276
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,400
If you disobey me,

277
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,919
what will happen to state security

278
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,440
and the people’s well-being?

279
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,175
Your Majesty,

280
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,440
Lang Huan isn’t the only solution

281
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,725
to the people’s misery.

282
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,440
I’m sure there’s another one.

283
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,799
Look at her! Look!

284
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,425
That’s your favorite...

285
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,980
apprentice.

286
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,359
I beg your pardon.

287
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,520
But as Consort Chunrong said,

288
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,039
there might be another solution

289
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,760
that we can try.

290
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,000
Like I said,

291
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,910
I’ve made a promise.

292
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,825
Do you want me to break my promise

293
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,275
and give the envoys a reason

294
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,800
to question the prosperity of Dazheng?

295
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
Fang Jianming,

296
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,900
this is not only about the state
and the people,

297
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,750
but also about...

298
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,880
To transport a merfolk to Tianqi

299
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,440
is too great a risk.

300
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,461
This is my order.

301
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,400
I want Lang Huan here.

302
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,575
You two bring her

303
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:54,925
to Tianqi safe and sound.

304
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,935
Don’t follow me.

305
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,650
I’ll go in alone.

306
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,925
Yes.

307
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:27,125
(Yu’an Palace)

308
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

309
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,740
Don’t get up.

310
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,630
Leave us.

311
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,320
I haven’t seen you for a few days.

312
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:48,000
How is your health?

313
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,675
There is no need to worry, Your Majesty.

314
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:51,080
I’m fine.

315
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,679
A physician

316
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,825
checked my pulse today.

317
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:55,125
He said everything is fine.

318
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,525
Great.

319
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:03,400
The baby is growing so fast.

320
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,450
I don’t know if it can hear me

321
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,850
talking to it.

322
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,159
Little one,

323
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,320
Father was too busy

324
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,559
with state affairs to come
and talk to you.

325
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,875
Have you been a good kid to your mother?

326
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,275
Your Majesty,

327
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,479
it has been good.

328
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,520
Great.

329
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,775
I’m not happy today.

330
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,520
Who is so bold

331
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,075
to have made Your Majesty unhappy?

332
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,840
I’m not being willful.

333
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,719
I just want to save my best friend.

334
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,479
I think

335
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,559
I should try

336
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,599
even if the chance is slim.

337
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:58,250
But none of them are on my side.

338
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
No one is ever

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,350
on my side.

340
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,725
I’m on your side.

341
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,900
And I’ll always be.

342
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Really?

343
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
I understand

344
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,950
that you just want

345
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,475
to protect your friend,

346
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,479
as you want to protect me.

347
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,080
But Your Majesty,

348
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,630
sometimes,

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,825
you have to tell them
what’s on your mind

350
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,840
so that they can understand.

351
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,239
I did.

352
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,450
They still don’t understand.

353
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,000
They will.

354
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,599
I’ll try again.

355
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,320
By the way,

356
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,150
Puyouma is here.

357
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,125
I know.

358
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,325
He wanted to see me.

359
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,050
You don’t want to see him?

360
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,359
If he sees me,

361
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,599
he must have something to ask for.

362
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,425
I’d better not see him.

363
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,915
As you wish.

364
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,199
You’re pregnant.

365
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,119
If he finds out,

366
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,975
maybe he’ll make a fuss about it.

367
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,950
Get some rest.

368
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
I should go.

369
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:40,925
Mm-hmm.

370
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,425
(Yu’an Palace)

371
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:50,175
Your Majesty.

372
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,359
To Fengwu Palace.

373
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,525
Huh?

374
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:53,775
Oh.

375
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,075
Come on!

376
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,075
Your Highness,

377
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,600
it’s late.

378
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,799
You should turn in.

379
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,045
His Majesty left his cloak here.

380
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,599
It’s my fault.

381
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,959
His Majesty left in a rush.

382
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,100
I forgot to get it for him.

383
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,725
They haven’t gone far.

384
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:26,925
Send a maid to go after them

385
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:27,560
with the cloak.

386
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,959
Though it’s spring,

387
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,050
the wind is high at night.

388
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,529
I don’t want him to catch a cold.

389
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,560
Yes.

390
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,275
(Fengwu Palace)

391
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:10,745
Sir.

392
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,359
Miss Bizi from Yu’an Palace

393
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,900
sent me to deliver the cloak
to His Majesty.

394
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,319
His Majesty left in a rush

395
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,350
and forgot the cloak.

396
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,275
What is His Majesty doing?

397
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,760
His Majesty has been gazing

398
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,719
at Fengwu Palace for a while.

399
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,349
Does His Majesty want to go in?

400
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:24,375
No idea.

401
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:26,500
But today, His Majesty

402
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,160
lost his temper at Consort Chunrong.

403
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,119
It seems he’s struggling.

404
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,520
Who is whispering here?

405
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:33,035
Behave yourself
in His Majesty’s presence.

406
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,600
Sir, I’ll leave His Majesty’s cloak
to you.

407
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,319
Mu Deqing.

408
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
Yes, I’m here.

409
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,875
(Fengwu Palace)

410
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,150
Your Majesty.

411
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,900
Give my word to the craftsmen

412
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,406
who are building the carriage
for Dragon Tail.

413
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,119
They have 3 days

414
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,075
to complete it.

415
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,319
I

416
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,439
want the carriage to be made
of the finest materials

417
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,079
and the finest decoration,

418
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,125
so that nothing will go wrong

419
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,479
on Dragon Tail’s trip here.

420
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
Your Majesty...

421
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,079
Do as you’re told.

422
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,599
Right now.

423
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:05,920
Yes.

424
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
His Majesty stays outside Fengwu Palace

425
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,319
for an unknown reason.

426
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,400
Isn’t Consort Chunrong

427
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,841
in Fengwu Palace?

428
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,825
No idea.

429
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,500
I heard during the day,

430
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,175
His Majesty lost his temper at her.

431
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,875
Miss Bizi,

432
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,839
if His Majesty has fallen
for Consort Chunrong,

433
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,211
Consort Shurong...

434
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,319
Watch your tongue.

435
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,700
You could get in trouble.

436
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,560
Go to bed.

437
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
Do not tell anyone about this.

438
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:39,235
Yes.

439
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,199
Consort Chunrong ordered us

440
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,719
to bring these gifts to Consort Shurong.

441
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,800
Please pass on the message.

442
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,520
Stewardess Yu,

443
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
without His Majesty’s order,

444
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,800
no one is allowed to get in
or out of Yu’an Palace.

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,959
Well,

446
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,359
can you deliver these to Consort Shurong

447
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,450
on my behalf?

448
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,119
Without a physician’s examination,

449
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,300
I cannot take these

450
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,199
inside.

451
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,880
Pardon me, Stewardess Yu.

452
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,280
Send the gifts

453
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
to Imperial Hospital for examination,

454
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,439
and ask them to return them.

455
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,700
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

456
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,501
Rise.

457
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,100
I thought I could send the gifts first.

458
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,479
It was so careless of me.

459
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,091
I want to see Consort Shurong.

460
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,050
Please, Your Highness.

461
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,359
Would you take them
to Imperial Hospital?

462
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,625
Yes.

463
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,950
(Yu’an Palace)

464
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,239
Haishi.

465
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,675
It’s such

466
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:33,696
a bulge now.

467
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:34,300
Mm-hmm.

468
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,900
Sit down. Don’t move around.

469
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,879
It’s fine. The physician said

470
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:40,275
it’s good for the baby to move around.

471
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,700
It’s always good to be careful.

472
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,675
Alright.

473
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,600
Here’s some tea, Your Highness.

474
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,750
I brought some gifts for you

475
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,199
from Xiping Port.

476
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,040
The physicians are examining them now.

477
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,800
Bizi, would you please get them

478
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,750
in a while?

479
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,680
Sure.

480
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,760
I’ll go wait by the palace gate.

481
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,520
Haishi,

482
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,160
you were gone for so long

483
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,040
for disaster relief.

484
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,900
Tell me about

485
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,941
the southwest

486
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,239
and everything you did

487
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,599
for disaster relief.

488
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,079
Greetings, Your Majesty.

489
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,079
I’m here to see Consort Shurong.

490
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,950
Did she sleep well last night?

491
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,040
(Yu’an Palace)
Your Majesty, Her Highness is fine.

492
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:27,425
She’s talking with Consort Chunrong now.

493
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,359
Consort Chunrong is here?

494
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,225
Yes.

495
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,635
Alright,

496
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,280
let them talk.

497
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,696
I’ll come over later.

498
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,039
Good day, Your Majesty.

499
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:01,375
(Yu’an Palace)

500
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,000
You’ve done so many dangerous things.

501
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,520
It’s scary.

502
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,040
But you’ve saved so many people.

503
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,959
Though you used Dragon Tail’s name,

504
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,839
Dragon Tail will not blame you.

505
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,575
By the way, Tilan,

506
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,439
for tribes in Leizhou,

507
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:18,959
is it so important

508
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,160
to be a believer?

509
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,560
Yes, it is.

510
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,239
We’re as close as sisters,

511
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,599
and we know each other well.

512
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,079
Otherwise, I’d have to kneel down

513
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,359
before the god’s messenger.

514
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,079
Seriously?

515
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,680
Dragon Tail

516
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,319
is the almighty in Leizhou.

517
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,319
When we’re in trouble,

518
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,375
or have a wish,

519
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,370
we’ll pray to Dragon Tail.

520
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,479
This

521
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:45,599
is the royal emblem of Zhunian.

522
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,000
Each newborn baby

523
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,399
will get one

524
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,959
and should never take it off,

525
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,079
because Dragon Tail

526
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,920
will bless us.

527
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
Is it the same for every tribe?

528
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,239
It is for all tribes in Leizhou.

529
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,119
You’re so respectful

530
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,400
to the messenger

531
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,760
of Dragon Tail.

532
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,920
What if you meet

533
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,839
Dragon Tail face to face?

534
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,825
All the more reason to kneel

535
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:07,945
and pray sincerely.

536
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,875
And we’ll obey all divine orders

537
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,875
of Dragon Tail,

538
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,625
and show not the slightest disrespect.

539
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,800
Haishi,

540
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,280
did you really meet Dragon Tail before?

541
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:27,680
It was a long time ago.

542
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,520
What?

543
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,439
Do you have something

544
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,125
to ask of Dragon Tail?

545
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,025
My mind is at peace now.

546
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:37,226
I have nothing to ask of.

547
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,025
But Haishi,

548
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:41,439
if you could bless my unborn baby

549
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,721
so it could grow up

550
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:43,680
peacefully and healthily,

551
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,375
I would be very grateful.

552
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,800
Really?

553
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,479
You’re a mother now.

554
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,400
Don’t make fun of me.

555
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,239
However,

556
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,479
your baby is like my own baby.

557
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,760
Though I’m not a god’s messenger,

558
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,319
I’m your baby’s aunt.

559
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,119
So I’ll be good to your baby.

560
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,839
Little one, dear,

561
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,199
soon, we’ll meet.

562
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,079
I wonder if you’re a boy

563
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,199
or a girl.

564
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,600
Whether it’s a boy or a girl,

565
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,479
I’m counting on your instruction.

566
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,959
No problem.

567
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,495
What’s wrong?

568
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,900
It’s nothing.

569
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,459
I get nauseous once in a while.

570
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,675
The physician said

571
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,850
it’s normal for a pregnant woman.

572
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,520
Wear it one last time today.

573
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,719
Tomorrow, you won’t have to
dress like a man.

574
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,839
Are you taking me to the horse ranch

575
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,520
to ask for His Majesty’s permission

576
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,199
that Ye Haishi

577
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
will be

578
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,359
Fang Jianming’s

579
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,160
legitimate wife

580
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,760
who will give birth to your children

581
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,319
and grow old with you?

582
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,160
Haishi?

583
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,399
I’m fine.

584
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,239
These are my gifts to you.

585
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,760
Well, I know your body is
of a cold nature.

586
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,300
So I bought

587
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,250
some tonic ingredients

588
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,500
and some fine tea

589
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,199
from the southwest.

590
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,400
(Jinchen Tea)
This tea can keep

591
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,375
(Jinchen Tea)
your body warm.

592
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,560
The baby is getting bigger and bigger.

593
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,959
You can’t use tonic medicine anymore.

594
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,575
So eat nutritious food

595
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,375
and gain some weight.

596
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,479
You’re too slim.

597
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,880
You’re so kind, Haishi.

598
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,600
Bizi,

599
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,199
take all of them away.

600
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:37,900
Yes.

601
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,640
You brought these

602
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,280
all the way back for me.

603
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,760
I won’t waste them.

604
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,400
I’ll eat more each meal. Promise.

605
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,280
You can’t eat too much.

606
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,880
If the baby is too big,

607
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,800
you’ll have difficulty

608
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,880
in laboring.

609
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,650
Better be a proper size.

610
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:53,599
You used to be candid.

611
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
In just a few months,

612
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,160
you’ve become so nagging.

613
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
What’s wrong with being nagging?

614
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,040
That’s because I care about you,

615
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,439
and the unborn baby.

616
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,350
Hey.

617
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,119
It jumped a little.

618
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,359
It didn’t jump.

619
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,000
It kicked me.

620
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
It kicked again.

621
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,439
Yes.

622
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,675
When His Majesty was here,

623
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,560
it didn’t move when he talked to it.

624
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,199
It moved for you.

625
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,520
I guess it likes you

626
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,839
and has a deep bond with you.

627
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,079
Today

628
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:28,050
is also the luckiest day for me.

629
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,650
Haishi.

630
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,079
What’s wrong?

631
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,160
Nothing.

632
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:37,719
You’re pregnant.

633
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,959
Don’t let it be a bother.

634
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,640
I’ve been here for a while.

635
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,359
I’d better leave now.

636
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,700
There’s no need to see me off.

637
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,640
I know Yu’an Palace very well.

638
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,119
You take a good rest.

639
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,850
Mm-hmm, come often.

640
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,160
As Tilan said,

641
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,479
all tribes in Leizhou

642
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,920
are devout believers

643
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,040
in Dragon Tail.

644
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,640
Should I take the risk

645
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,760
of bringing Lang Huan to Tianqi

646
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,959
to settle the gold price dispute

647
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
with tribes in Leizhou?

648
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,525
His Majesty was determined yesterday.

649
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,920
What’s

650
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,439
on Master’s mind now?

651
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:38,675
(Moral and Virtuous)

652
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,839
Lord Qinghai.

653
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,625
Greetings, Your Highness.

654
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:26,314
Rise.

655
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,550
I’m here today

656
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
to ask for your advice.

657
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,426
Is something wrong?

658
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,599
This is a matter of the state.

659
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,200
May we talk inside?

660
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,145
Forgive me.

661
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,210
Please, Your Highness.

662
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:09,599
Master,

663
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,259
I’m your apprentice.

664
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,040
It’s a lifelong bond

665
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,270
between us.

666
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,725
Please

667
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:19,599
regard me as your apprentice.

668
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,439
I have something to ask you, Master.

669
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,725
I’m all ears, Your Highness.

670
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,220
And I’ll be frank with you.

671
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,319
His Majesty mentioned

672
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,959
about bringing Lang Huan to Tianqi

673
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:39,640
to settle the dispute on the gold price.

674
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,079
I know

675
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,125
you don’t agree.

676
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,760
But the drought in the southwest

677
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,839
took a toll on the people.

678
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,640
The tie with Hanzhou is also fragile.

679
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,959
If we can’t settle this dispute

680
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,640
with tribes in Leizhou,

681
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,119
I’m afraid

682
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,359
we’ll be boxed up eventually.

683
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,800
So the dispute on the gold price

684
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,199
has to be resolved soon.

685
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,725
Since all tribes in Leizhou

686
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:05,040
believe in Dragon Tail.

687
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,975
I want to pay a state visit to Leizhou

688
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,361
as a god’s messenger,

689
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,439
talk them

690
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:12,079
into an agreement with Dazheng.

691
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,359
Do you think it’s feasible?

692
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,199
It takes a lot of time and effort.

693
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,775
I’m afraid it’s not His Majesty’s
first choice.

694
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,319
But Master, you know

695
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,475
once Lang Huan leaves the sea,

696
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,800
a tiny slip could kill her.

697
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,839
She saved my life.

698
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,800
I cannot risk hers.

699
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,225
Tribes in Leizhou

700
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:35,359
might have already bowed to Nihualuo.

701
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
Your visit to Leizhou

702
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,280
is equally dangerous.

703
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,760
Haishi,

704
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,800
I told His Majesty your encounter

705
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,640
with Lang Huan,

706
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,520
not to let you take any risks.

707
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,199
You know

708
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,800
it’s the best option right now.

709
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,400
When I worked for Jifeng Pavilion,

710
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,225
none of the tasks I took

711
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:00,760
were absolutely safe.

712
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,830
I do what I think is right.

713
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,800
You know me, Master.

714
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,400
But I’m not sure if I can

715
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,675
convince His Majesty.

716
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,520
Because I don’t know much
about the customs

717
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,400
and politics of tribes in Leizhou.

718
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,079
I need your instruction.

719
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,025
It’s not a good time today.

720
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,880
If you want to ask about Leizhou,

721
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,925
come back tomorrow.

722
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,599
Thank you, Master.

723
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,075
I should go.

724
00:32:55,275 --> 00:33:00,174
(Essence of Beauty Reveals Itself)

725
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,725
Good day, Your Highness.

726
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,560
Haishi is a clever girl.

727
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,400
After the trip to the southwest,

728
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,880
she’s more visionary.

729
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,199
The situation is clear.

730
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,319
If we don’t settle the dispute soon,

731
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,800
she’ll take the risk.

732
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,119
Madam.

733
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,199
Miss,

734
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:42,959
welcome.

735
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,640
Show some respect.

736
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:46,550
This is Princess Tara,
the beloved daughter

737
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,640
of Lord of Right Pudun.

738
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,025
Oh.

739
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,520
Forgive my impertinence.

740
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,075
I didn’t know you’re a princess.

741
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:53,959
Sorry.

742
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,280
Don’t listen to her.

743
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
I don’t mind.

744
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,880
By the way, Madam.

745
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,959
I have a favor to ask.

746
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,839
I remember you said

747
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,250
you could make

748
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,411
Dazheng’s costumes.

749
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,150
Yes.

750
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,959
What clothes would you like to make?

751
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:08,719
I want

752
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,800
to make the underrobe

753
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,560
that Dazheng men wear.

754
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,800
Men’s wear?

755
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,560
Our princess

756
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,919
is about to get married.

757
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,080
It is customary

758
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,159
that she prepares a set of new clothes

759
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,399
for her bridegroom.

760
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,280
The underrobe is especially important.

761
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,560
So our princess comes to you.

762
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,439
Your Highness’s bridegroom

763
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,560
is a man from Dazheng?

764
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,600
No.

765
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,800
My cousin Duohan is from Hanzhou.

766
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
It’s just he grew up in Zhongzhou.

767
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,050
So I want to give him

768
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,250
the underrobe in Zhongzhou style.

769
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:40,919
Congratulations, Your Highness.

770
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,750
When do you need it?

771
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,869
Do you bring a note of his sizes?

772
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,919
Yes.

773
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,360
Is it a little pressing

774
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,879
if I want it tomorrow?

775
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,840
Tomorrow?

776
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,479
It is quite pressing.

777
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,750
I know it’s difficult.

778
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,439
But the wedding is approaching.

779
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,679
Just a moment, Your Highness.

780
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,275
I’ll be right back.

781
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,800
Wait, Madam.

782
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Can you ask the embroiderer for me

783
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,525
if she can complete it on time?

784
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,439
I’ll pay any amount of gold to you.

785
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:22,639
Miss.

786
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,800
Aunt Su.

787
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Accept it.

788
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,375
I’ll rush it out

789
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:28,439
today.

790
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,500
We can turn her down.

791
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,729
Why do you have to make it difficult
for yourself?

792
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:37,450
Perhaps this will be the last chance

793
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,239
in my life to make clothes for him.

794
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,080
All right.

795
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,600
Your Highness,

796
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,600
the embroiderer said

797
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,159
you could leave a note of his sizes

798
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,280
and come to pick it up tomorrow.

799
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,120
Really? Thank you, Madam.

800
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,239
How much gold do you charge?

801
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:06,800
Your Highness’s wedding

802
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,439
is a great event in the grassland.

803
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,639
It’s free.

804
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,280
Take it as our wedding gift.

805
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,120
Are you sure?

806
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,879
You’ll have to work extra hours on it.

807
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,800
This is a token of our congratulations.

808
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:19,120
Don’t mention it.

809
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:20,520
Alright.

810
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,550
Thank you, Madam.

811
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:22,280
I’ll be

812
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,639
a regular customer.

813
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:51,900
(Moral and Virtuous)

814
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,399
The Jifeng Flowers

815
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,000
are in full bloom this year.

816
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,399
Your Highness.

817
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:09,800
Lord Qinghai.

818
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:18,000
This way, please.

819
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,280
I know you’re here

820
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,479
for information about Leizhou.

821
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,719
I’ve had them get prepared.

822
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,244
Tea is ready in the courtyard.

823
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,575
It’s been raining a lot this year,

824
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,875
especially since spring.

825
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,560
The flowers are blooming.

826
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,239
Trees have no feelings.

827
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,239
Whether its master is here,

828
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,760
or not,

829
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,760
it sprouts and blooms as usual,

830
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,360
completely unaffected by anything.

831
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,919
You’re weak lately.

832
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,719
Is it because of an old wound

833
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,120
or Baixi?

834
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,175
Don’t worry about it.

835
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:19,400
It’s the climate.

836
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:20,439
No big deal.

837
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,399
Let’s get started.

838
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,879
I still remember

839
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,159
the geography of each state.

840
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,159
You discussed it with me

841
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,239
after you came back from Huangquan Pass.

842
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,879
How much do you remember

843
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,105
about Leizhou?

844
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,199
I remember you said

845
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,800
on the north of Leizhou

846
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,040
is Yunzhou covered by the dense forest.

847
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,479
To its east

848
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
across the sea is Wanzhou on East Land.

849
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,199
It covers an area
of 990,000 square meters.

850
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,040
As for the others,

851
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
I don’t remember.

852
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,925
Then I’ll tell you one more time.

853
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:09,479
Due to the climate and geography

854
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,399
of Leizhou,

855
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:12,719
tribes on the West Land

856
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,725
are prone to natural disasters,

857
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,600
such as river diversion,

858
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:21,040
and windstorms.

859
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,280
Starting from August,

860
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,900
a few storms from the sea greet Leizhou.

861
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,725
They draw seawater,

862
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,840
marine animals, sailors

863
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,800
and wrecked boats along the way.

864
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,399
The people of Leizhou believe

865
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,520
it’s Dragon Tail

866
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,439
collecting tributes.

867
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,959
The windstorm is unpredictable.

868
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,399
But for the people of Leizhou

869
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,200
who make a living from the sea,

870
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,760
it is the toughest time

871
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,159
of a year.

872
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,280
What’s on your mind?

873
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:12,840
I...

874
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,719
I’m thinking

875
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:19,150
about the lecture on ancient classics

876
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,700
in the palace days ago.

877
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,120
I overheard some.

878
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:24,120
Really?

879
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,600
So you’re thinking about
ancient classics?

880
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,840
Yes.

881
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,239
What else do you think I’m thinking,

882
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:30,879
Master?

883
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,675
You want to learn geography.

884
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,850
So stay with me

885
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,120
and concentrate.

886
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Or you won’t learn anything.

887
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,400
Yes, Master.

888
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,500
Let’s continue.

889
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,320
After the natural disasters,

890
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,120
a pandemic follows.

891
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,575
That’s why...

892
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,450
Your Highness.

893
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,199
I’m sorry. Master, go on, please.

894
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,850
If you cannot focus,

895
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,560
I don’t think the lecture is necessary.

896
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,520
I just thought

897
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:22,679
since you live in Zhaoming Palace,

898
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,700
whenever I have a question,

899
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:26,280
I can come for an answer.

900
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,719
There’s a life ahead of us.

901
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,919
We have plenty of time.

902
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,399
When I thought about it,

903
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,479
I slacked off

904
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:35,919
and let my mind wander.

905
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:41,915
“There’s a life ahead of us.”

906
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:48,399
Forget it.

907
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,959
Let’s call it a day.

908
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,199
Master.

909
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:52,600
Master.

910
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:57,479
Are you angry

911
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,760
because I didn’t focus

912
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
on the lecture?

913
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,959
You misunderstood.

914
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,760
All my lecture is included

915
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,600
in Zhounan Digest

916
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,040
of Commentary on the Waterways Classic
of East Land.

917
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:19,575
What you said just now

918
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:21,840
reminded me

919
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,399
that you’re a consort,

920
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,679
not a primary student.

921
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,000
There’s a life ahead of us?

922
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,879
I cannot serve you

923
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,719
every day.

924
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,919
Since I moved to the palace,

925
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,926
you and I have done nothing unethical.

926
00:42:48,575 --> 00:42:50,535
So because I’m a consort,

927
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,159
you and I

928
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,199
can’t have a normal conversation

929
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
in the presence of others?

930
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:57,520
No,

931
00:42:59,175 --> 00:42:59,974
we can’t.

932
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,199
Your Highness is noble.

933
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,879
And I’m in fear of gossip.

934
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,040
In fear of gossip?

935
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,700
Master, you’re still the same as before.

936
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:25,175
You value your reputation

937
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,055
more than anything else.

938
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:34,520
