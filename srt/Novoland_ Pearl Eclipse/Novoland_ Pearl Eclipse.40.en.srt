Why did you come to Xiping Port?

00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,440
I know it’s you

29
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,399
because

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,399
if I said I fell sick,

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,279
you’d definitely come.

00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,199

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,520

It’ll be gone after I wake up.

36
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,470
I just want to talk to you.

37
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,160
Did I

38
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,880
handle the disaster relief well?

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
You did great.

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,399
Did you come

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
because you worried about me?

42
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:11,950
Yes.

Liu Changping and Baili Yuan

44
00:04:17,275 --> 00:04:19,715

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,079
but they might’ve done it
for the locals.

46
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,400
Get to the bottom of it.

47
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,679
If that’s the case,

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
they deserve mercy.

49
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,880
Regardless of what the law says?

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Justice must be tempered with mercy.

51
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,279
His Majesty will understand that.

52
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,119

Liu Changping, Baili Yuan,

101

it’s been confirmed that

102
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,799
you sold rice against the law

103
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,819

instead of filling your own pockets.

106
00:06:58,425 --> 00:06:59,799
That said,

107
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,975
your action is illegal

108
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,536

00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:14,320

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,559
for the loss of rice at Xiping Port.

Yes.

is my command.

131
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:46,576
Madam,

132
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,960
I committed a capital crime.

133
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,320
Having me dismissed

134
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,160
would be lenient enough,

135
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,480
but you’re still making me

136
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,679
Inspector of Xiping Port.

137
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,000
I’m afraid that’s against the law.

138
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,160
I think...

139
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,700
His Majesty has given me
the Imperial Inspector’s Seal.

140
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,399
Here in the southwest,

141
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,050
I’m representing him.

142
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,830
My decision

143
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,480
is also his.

144
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,611
Mr. Liu,

145
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,055
any objections?

146
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,625
No,

147
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:15,374
of course not.

148
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:17,445
I

149
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,755
appreciate it, Madam.

150
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,640
You may rise.

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,200
The disaster here over the past few days

152
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,871
has destroyed people’s homes

153
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,306
and livelihood.

154
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,599
In addition to the Xiping Port,

155
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,839
other areas in the region need help.

156
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:40,795
I hope you two

157
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:42,394
can work with me

158
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,925
and help

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
the locals

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,925
back on their feet.

161
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:49,175
- Yes.
- Yes.

162
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,760
Excellent!

163
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
I knew she could do it!

164
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,119
Men are tall and strong

165
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,150
but how many of them

166
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,631
are as capable as Fang Haishi?

167
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,359
Indeed! You’re absolutely right!

168
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,975
Consort Chunrong
is as good if not better.

169
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,080
Still, at the end of the day,

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,320
thanks to your trust in her,

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,119
she could eventually prove herself.

172
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,559
Otherwise,

173
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,679
there was nothing she could do.

174
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,559

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,760
your sweet talk

176
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,119
is getting better and better.

177
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I mean it, Your Majesty.

178
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,775
I wonder what Jianming is thinking

179
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,239
that he’s there

180
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,239
without revealing himself.

181
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,825
Well...

182
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,919
I wouldn’t dare

183
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,799
to speculate.

184
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Your Majesty,

185
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,475
Treasurer Wu is here.

186
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,175
Send him in.

187
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,039
Yes.

188
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

189
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,275
Rise.

190
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,159
What’s that look?

192
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,525
Was your house on fire?

193
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
Your Majesty,

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,239
since gold was allocated

195
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,520
for new ditches, dams and warehouses

196
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,039
as part of the disaster relief,

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,599
(Since gold was allocated)
there has been an outflow of it,

198
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,159
(for new ditches, dams and warehouses…)
causing its price to plummet.

199
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,625
When the market was stable,

200
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,400
one tael of gold

201
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,400
was equal to 10,000 copper coins,

202
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,799
but right now,

203
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
it’s only worth

204
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
half of the value.

205
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,320
Gold speculators from the West Land

206
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,679
mortgaged houses in their hometowns

207
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
and borrowed money from loan sharks

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,520
to buy and sell gold to the East Land.

209
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,039
Given the

210
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,625
current slump,

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,520
they’ve basically lost everything

212
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,159
with no chance of getting it back.

213
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,775
You can see them everywhere

214
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:54,880
in the streets in town these days,

215
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,239
drinking and moping alone

216
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
aside from those

217
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,159
who have already killed themselves.

218
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,825
No wonder

219
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,760
tribes of the West Land

220
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,320
are sending envoys

221
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,119
to Tianqi in haste.

222
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,719
Your Majesty,

223
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:14,880
please stabilize the gold market

224
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,280
to prevent panic.

225
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,679
If anyone were to panic,

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
that’d be those greedy speculators

227
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,675
from the West Land.

228
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,675
Why should we care?

229
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,000
Your Majesty...

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,679
Enough.

231
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,760
Bury

232
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,599
the deceased.

233
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,400
The rest isn’t your concern.

234
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
You may leave.

235
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,599
Yes,

236
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,359
Your Majesty.

237
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,510
When will Consort Chunrong be back?

238
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,155
Your Majesty,

239
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,125
according to the schedule,

240
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,239
she’ll set off shortly.

241
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,840
Why are you rushing back

242
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,960
to the capital, Madam?

243
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,239
You’ve been working

244
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,760
tirelessly on the disaster relief.

245
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,960
Things are just picking up

246
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,039
and you’re leaving already?

247
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,960
With you two in Xiping Port

248
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,599
and the smooth work in other areas,

249
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,479
there’s nothing else I can do.

250
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,479
It’s time for me to report back

251
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,440
to His Majesty.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
Too bad,

253
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,799
you haven’t got to see

254
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,175
the show you love

255
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,679
before leaving.

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,280
Mr. Liu and I

257
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
feel guilty about that.

258
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,119
It’s not your fault, Mr. Baili.

259
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,000
Madam Pearl,

260
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
the streets are packed with the locals

261
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,239
who are there to bow to you

262
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,559
and see you off.

263
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,520
Madam,

264
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,679
you should go and meet them.

265
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,159
They can’t wait to pay respects

266
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,799
to the one

267
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,000
who saved their lives.

268
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,289
Praying for rain

269
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,359
was acted out of expediency

270
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,159
for the sake of the people.

271
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,600
I never meant to be put on a pedestal.

272
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,400
I admire

273
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,919
your selflessness

274
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,200
but people

275
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
need hope

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
and your blessing to live on.

277
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,559
They’ve seen you

278
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
as the messenger of god

279
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,119
because of your miracle.

280
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,525
- Please fulfill their wish, Madam.

Kneel. Get down.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,750
On the ground.

290
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,359
- Madam Pearl!
- Madam Pearl!

291
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,749
All rise.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,919
- Thank you, Madam Pearl.
- Thank you, Madam Pearl.

293
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,960
From now on,

294
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,719
you’re not only Fang Haishi,

295
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,320
but also Madam Pearl of Dazheng.

296
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,320
Is this also what you want,

297
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,399
seeing me come this far?

298
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,919
It’s not about me.

299
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,520
You’ve gotten where you are

300
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,559
step by step.

301
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,039
Madam Pearl!

302
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,840
Hua.

303
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,799
We’re all here.

304
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,799
I, Yu,

305
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,719
and my mother-in-law.

306

I also found my younger brother,

Bao.

308
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,760
Madam.

309
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,039
Good boy.

310
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,239
You saved all of us.

311
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,679
You saved the southwest!

312
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
Am I right?

313
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,239
- Yes!
- Absolutely!

314
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,640
Thank you, Madam Pearl!

315
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,325
We owe you, Madam Pearl!

What can I get you, sir?

330
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:32,919
We have men’s and women’s wear

This way, please.

Ma’am,

you have a visitor.

336
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,740
Greetings, ma’am.

337
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,625
Skip the formalities.

338
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,400
You must be

339

340

Yes, ma’am.

Ma’am,

342
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,175
how do you feel

about running a shop

344
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:26,640
in a border town in Hanzhou?

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,675
I enjoy my stay.

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,200
What did you find

348
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,375
about the Left Tribe?

349
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,125
According to my secret contact there,

350
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,524
recently, the gold market is volatile

351
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,960
and the Left Tribe is eager for action.

352
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,719
Once Duoluo makes any move,

353
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,000
we’ll be

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,075
tipped off.

355
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,825
Very well.

356
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,350
When the news arrived,

357
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,475
I’ll have you

358
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,925
send a message to Earlji.

359
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:53,880
Yes.

360
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,760
Ma’am,

361
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,280
you and Young Master Zhuoying

362
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,210
should know each other well
as you both worked in the Palace.

363
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,680
Now that you’re here,

364
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
why not

365
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,191
contact him directly?

366
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,439
Mr. Fang

367
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,650
is no longer

368
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,040
a member of Jifeng Pavilion

369
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
but Prince Duohan of Huku.

370
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,079
As the Right Tribe is still unstable,

371
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,600
and I’m already dead

372
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,225
in the public eye,

373
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,160
it’s too soon to

374
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
reach out to him in person.

375
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,000
Mr. Zhuang.

376
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,650
Yes?

377
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,880
You’ll still be the liaison

378
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,640
between us and Earlji.

379
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:40,650
Yes.

380
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,888
(Clothes and Embroideries)

381
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,675
Surround this shop.

382
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,599
Don’t let anyone in.

383
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,560
- Yes!
- Yes!

384
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,920
- Move! Go!
- Go!

385
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,800
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

386
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,079
Go!

387
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,000
Get out!

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,680
Out!

389
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
- Go!
- What...?

390
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,800
Don’t panic, ma’am. Let me go check.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,875
Sir,

392
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
what’s going on?

393
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,439
Did we do

394
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:04,439
anything wrong?

395
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,225
Or is there some misunderstanding?

396
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,319
Relax.

397
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,110
Consider yourself lucky.

398
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,000
I’m asked

399
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,079
to come here

400
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,319
because you’re selling good stuff.

401
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,199
We’re honored to have you here.

402
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,359
May I ask whom you’re buying it for?

403
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,800
Does he or she have any preferences?

404
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:19,640
She’s...

405
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,400
Luerdan,

406
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:23,520
I told you

407
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
this is over the top.

408
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
I don’t like it.

409
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,959
Listen,

410
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,319
you’re of noble birth.

411
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
Civilians can’t be

412
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:31,550
in the same shop as you.

413
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,575
Hey...

414
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,760
Besides,

415
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,250
your safety is a top priority.

416
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,929
I can protect myself.

417
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,280
Don’t do it again

418
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
or I’ll be mad.

419
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,599
Sure.

420
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,040
Aren’t you here for clothes?

421
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,160
Go look around.

422
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:49,920
Ma’am,

423
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,439
it’s Lord of Right Pudun,

424
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,325
Earlji’s daughter,

425
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:53,359
Princess Tara,

426
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,925
and one of his generals,

427
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,034
Luerdan.

428
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,525
Princess Tara?

429
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,175
It doesn’t sound

430
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,479
like a raid.

431
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,280
Yes.

432
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
More like a coincidence.

433
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,199
Still, we can’t lower the guard.

434
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,959
Stay in the back

435
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,425
and leave after it’s dark

436
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:10,680
in case of trouble.

437
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,520
Yes.

438
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,040
Everything in your shop

439
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,640
is indeed the best of the best.

440
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,880
No wonder it’s become a household name

441
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,040
shortly after the opening.

442
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,280
You have good taste, Miss.

443
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
We’ve been doing this for generations.

444
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,040
People love our clothes wherever we go.

445
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,319
They say

446
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,880
you have costumes of Huku,

447
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Nihualuo, Zhunian

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,199
and Dazheng.

449
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,400
All of them

450
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,079
can be customized to your liking.

451
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,100
Which one do you prefer?

452
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,719
I can show you some

453
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,719
for you to choose from.

454
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,400
I’d like those of Dazheng.

455
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Sure.

456
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,040
I’ll go get them.

457
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,520
What’s so good about them anyway?

458
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,560
They’re flashy

459
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
and not for riding.

460
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,760
Ours are more beautiful

461
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,920
and durable.

462
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,880
Luerdan,

463
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,680
you’re wrong.

464
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,119
Their costumes

465
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,438
are elegant and exquisite.

466
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,319
As Duohan said,

467
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,040
most of the best embroiderers

468
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,675
are from Dazheng

469
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,250
which produces

470
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,850
delicately embroidered garments.

471
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,079
That Duohan again!

472
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,599
You no longer listen to anyone

473
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,959
except for him.

474
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,560
Is there a problem?

475
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
Duohan

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
is the hero of our tribe.

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,175
All our members

478
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:24,359
love talking to him

479
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,479
and listening to him.

480
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,680
Uncle Earlji...

481
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,160
Say no more!

482
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,721
Throughout the never-ending wars
in Hanzhou,

483
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,410
the Jiamanese have always been
human shields.

484
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,319
Do you have any idea

485
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,400
of the loss we’ll suffer

486
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,159
if we battle Duoluo

487
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,319
over them?

488
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,050
The Jiamanese

489
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,450
are no longer who they were.

490
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,599
They’re battling Duoluo to the end.

491
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
If Duoluo wins,

492
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
he’ll gain a larger territory

493
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,239
and a stronger force.

494
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,225
By that time,

495
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,959
no one in Hanzhou will be his match,

496
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,825
us included.

497
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:55,975
We’ll have to surrender to him.

498
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,940
Have you made up your mind?

499
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,839
Please let me go.

500
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,149
I can help you

501
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,600
and give you troops

502
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,839
on one condition.

503
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,119
What is it?

504
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Marry my daughter,

505
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,700
Tara.

506
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,775
What?

507
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,705
This message just came in

508
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,355
that Duoluo

509
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,275
would launch

510
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,359
his final attack on Lanzi

511
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,959
before noon tomorrow.

512
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,550
All his troops would be mobilized,

513
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,400
meaning

514
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,000
their base

515
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,880
in the back

516
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,500
would be left unguarded.

517
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,821
Who sent you this message?

518
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,359
My secret contact in the Left Tribe.

519
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,599
Thanks to

520
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,880
all that information from him,

521
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,000
Duoluo hasn’t been able to break me.

522
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,359
Who is

523
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,640
this person?

524
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,119
A man

525
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,250
who was trained

526
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,569
to weave in Zhongzhou.

527
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,795
But no one has seen his face.

528
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,160
Duohan,

529
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:58,816
think it over.

530
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,271
If you marry Tara,

531
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,825
I’ll fulfill

532
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:04,079
my promise.

533
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,094
Take your time.

534
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,189
Give me your answer by tonight.

535
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,050
Zheliu,

536
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,439
is that you?

537
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,845
You’ve left for almost six months.

538
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
What am I thinking?

539
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:01,760
Duohan.

540
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,475
Is this marriage thing bothering you?

541
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,439
Just now, Father asked to see me

542
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,400
and told me

543
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,640
to take your measurements

544
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,040
and make you a robe.

545
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,760
In Huku,

546
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,359
the bride’s dowries

547
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,560
should include cows, sheep,

548
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,439
camels, horses

549
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,975
and a new robe

550
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:25,574
for the groom

551
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,425
to wear next to the skin

552
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:28,425
and feel the bride’s love.

553
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,825
Tara,

554
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:31,959
I...

555
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,640
I know.

556
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,050
Just stop there.

557
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,560
You always look in

558
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,040
the direction of Zhongzhou alone.

559
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,439
I guess

560
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,600
you’re missing

561
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,150
someone there.

562
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,760
That person must

563
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,160
mean the most to you.

564
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,400
I’m sure she’s a wonderful girl,

565
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,000
or you wouldn’t

566
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
like her so much.

567
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,625
Tara...

568
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,119
That’s fine, Duohan.

569
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,719
Tons of the Jiamanese

570
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,160
are in desperate need of your help.

571
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,075
You should do

572
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,325
what you think is right.

573
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,439
Even if we’re married,

574
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,000
I’ll be quiet

575
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,319
and I won’t stop you

576
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,040
from thinking of her.

577
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,940
I’ll only wait patiently

578
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,319
until you

579
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,640
let me in your heart.

580
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:29,950
Thank you.

581
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,719
No need

582
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,000
because I like you

583
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:34,355
and

584
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,079
I’ll

585
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,520
do anything for you.

586
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:41,079
We can pretend to be together

587
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,079
in front of others.

588
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,400
I’m fine with that.

589
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,839
I remember

590
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,150
it was the Jiamanese

591
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,650
who helped you back.

592
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,160
Without them,

593
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,225
we wouldn’t have met.

594
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,000
It’s time to pay them back.

595
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,160
Madam Pearl is back.

596
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
- Yes.
- She’s here.

597
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,100
(East Gate)

598
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,239
That’s Madam Pearl.

599
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,479
What she did is really something!

600
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,160
Really?

601
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,520
- She ended famine.
- Unbelievable!

602
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,825
She’s an angel!

603
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,239
- I agree!
- Indeed.

604
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,025
Protect Consort Chunrong!

605
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,075
Step back! Go away!

606
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,880
Back!

607
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,199
My poor husband!

608
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:43,524
Why did you do this?

609
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,280
We don’t need gold!

610
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,769
We don’t need gold!

611
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,245
- There are many suicide cases lately.
- I just need you to be alive.

612
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:55,040
Some jumped.

613
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,439
Some hung or poisoned themselves.

614
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,280
Those West Land gold speculators

615
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,599
- made a killing earlier.
- My poor husband!

616
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,560
But now,

617
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,359
the gold price is plunging.

618
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
I heard

619
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,199
they all borrowed money to buy gold.

620
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,100
What?

621
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,479
- It’s not your concern.
- But we have plenty of gold.

622
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,571
Who knows?

623
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,640
After the disaster relief

624
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,439
and a long journey,

625
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:12,800
you should rest.

626
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,680
- I’ll report this to His Majesty.
- Please open your eyes!

627
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,319
Go back in the carriage.

628
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Darling...

629
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,479
Lord Qinghai,

630
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,850
due to gold speculators’ suicide,

631
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,119
there’s growing unrest in the city.

632
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,880
Now that you’re here,

633
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,560
could you escort me back

634
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,181
in case of more trouble

635
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,300
on the way?

636
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,230
Yes, Your Highness.

637
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,975
Master looks terrible

638
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:53,319
and he’s even slimmer.

639
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,944
What happened?

640
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,839
You must be worn out by the travel.

641
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,800
Now that you’re back,

642
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,319
rest as long as you need, Your Highness.

643
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:05,850
What’s wrong?

644
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,920
Is the water too hot?

645
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:08,066
It’s fine.

646
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,239
Yuran,

647
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,625
I need you to ask around about the cause

648
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,920
of the slump in the gold price

649
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,359
and how tribes of the West Land

650
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,880
react to that.

651
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,205
Yes.

652
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,405
Also,

653
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,439
have the physician of Zhaoming Palace

654
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,700
come here.

655
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,760
Are you feeling unwell?

656
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,319
Let me call in your physician.

657
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,518
No need.

658
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,175
I need to ask him something.

659
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,160
Go there in person

660
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,675
and keep it from anyone,

661
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,450
including members of Jifeng Pavilion.

662
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,545
Yes.

663
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

664
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,230
Here you are

665
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,019
after so long.

666
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,754
Physician Li couldn’t find you

667
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,625
and came here to wait.

668
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:15,640
Lord Qinghai.

669
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,680
Sorry to keep you waiting, Physician Li.

670
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,549
Sit with me.

671
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:28,295
Why didn’t you go to Physician Li

672
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,519
as soon as you arrived?

673
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,300
A gold speculator from Nihualuo

674
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,560
killed himself in the street earlier.

675
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,359
It took me a while

676
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,599
to settle the bereaved

677
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,599
and gather information.

678
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,439
What were you thinking?

679
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,199
None of that is as important

680
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,040
as your health,

681
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,150
don’t you know?

682
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,880
I’m sorry.

683
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,359
You’re always like this

684
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,050
that you apologize and do it again.

685
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,560
How’s he?

686
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,150
Your Majesty,

687
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,000
it’s the same as before.

688
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,479
Luminous pearl powder has suppressed

689
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,000
the poison in Lord Qinghai’s system,

690
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,040
hence

691
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,199
the seemingly healthy look

692
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,439
just like others’.

693
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,359
But the toxic substance

694
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,920
is still there.

695
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,825
Is there a way to remove it?

696
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,500
I’m still

697
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,560
working on that.

698
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,920
But...

699
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,119
But Dawn Flower isn’t like

700
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,000
any other poison.

701
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,079
Its antidote

702
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,959
is yet to be found.

703
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,880
My concern is

704
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,959
the luminous pearl powder

705
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:33,875
is limited...

706
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,719
Useless!

707
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:35,600
Good-for-nothing!

708
00:30:36,175 --> 00:30:37,239
How long has it been?

709
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:37,950
Any result?

710
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:39,675
You keep telling me the same thing!

711
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:40,599
What else can you do?

712
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,300
Your Majesty,

713
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,680
it’s not Physician Li’s fault.

714
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,839
Please don’t blame him.

715
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,050
Go back and keep searching!

716
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:51,615
Yes, Your Majesty.

717
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,800
Thank you, Physician Li.

718
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,450
Sure.

719
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,800
Come.

720
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:13,606
What is it, Physician Li?

721
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,015
It’s fine. You can tell me.

722
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,400
Lord Qinghai’s pulse

723
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,119
is worrisome.

724
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:25,405
Are you sure?

725
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,319
What to do?

726
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,439
His Majesty was furious

727
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,469
and Lord Qinghai was there, too,

728
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,985
so I didn’t dare to say the truth.

729
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,839
This is huge.

730
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,741
You need to tell His Majesty.

731
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,319
How about this?

732
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,520
Come back tomorrow

733
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,400
and explain everything to His Majesty.

734
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,280
I could do that

735
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:55,625
but His Majesty might be enraged...

736
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,079
and chop my head off.

737
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,079
He always trusts you.

738
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,725
As long as you explain everything to him

739
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:07,239
and tell him the truth,

740
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,760
he won’t do anything to you

741
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,839
no matter how mad he gets.

742
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,719
Fine.

743
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,300
I’ll take your advice.

744
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,900
Good.

745
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,200
Thank you, Eunuch Mu.

746
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,639
That box of luminous pearls

747
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,721
has bought me a few more months

748
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,120
than I deserve.

749
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,079
You can stop worrying about me.

750
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,839
I only hope

751
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,119
I can hold long enough

752
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,959
to fix the gold price,

753
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,450
then I’ll die without any regrets.

754
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,931
Easy for you to say.

755
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,560
Like I’m some

756
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,625
cold-blooded monster

757
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,450
who sits and does nothing while you die!

758
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,524
That’s not what I mean.

759
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,000
While you were away,

760
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,680
I was thinking day and night

761
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,040
and came up with something

762
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,959
worth a shot.

763
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:06,079
You haven’t taken his pulse for a while?

764
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,119
That’s right.

765
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,119
Ever since he came back

766
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,839
from the Horse Ranch
on Lord Chang’s birthday,

767
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,375
he hasn’t let me take it.

768
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,920
But...

769
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,381
But he was covered with wounds before

770
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,280
and still had his pulse taken on time

771
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,500
for his own sake.

772
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,001
You already said

773
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,860
he’d only have a few years left

774
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,239
without proper treatment and rest.

775
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,760
Why not have his pulse taken now?

776
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,725
I’ve tried several times

777
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,284
but he’s kept saying no.

778
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:38,000
And I can’t force him

779
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,640
to tell me why.

780
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,040
I’d appreciate it

781
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,359
if you could keep an eye on him.

782
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,599
If something goes wrong...

783
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,479
I’ll let you know.

784
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,199
Do not

785
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,040
tell anyone else about it.

786
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,160
Understood.

787
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,009
You have my word, Your Highness.

788
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,800
I shall take my leave.

789
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Yuran.

790
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,639
Yes, Your Highness.

791
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,120
Where’s His Majesty now?

792
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,520
Does he have time?

793
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,450
His Majesty asked you

794
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,879
to rest for now.

795
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,840
He’d summon you tomorrow.

796
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,625
Right now, he’s with Lord Qinghai.

797
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,080
With them

798
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,520
together,

799
00:34:29,975 --> 00:34:31,215
even if I asked him,

800
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,951
he wouldn’t say anything.

801
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,719
We can’t do this.

802
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,800
Why?

803
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,244
The merfolk lives in the deep sea.

804
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,439
She’ll die without water.

805
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,070
Haishi encountered her

806
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
in Yuezhou

807
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,520
which is far away from Zhongzhou.

808
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,280
No way would we deliver her

809
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,900
to Tianqi safely.

810
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:59,784
This huge move

811
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,159
might go south,

812
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:04,280
causing riots in West Land tribes.

813
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,629
The war would break out again

814
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,719
and we’d be to blame forever.

815
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,760
I can’t take such a consequence.

816
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,080
Don’t you want to

817
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,199
save yourself?

818
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,850
Of course, I do.

819
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,879
No one would rather

820
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:19,840
die

821
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
than live.

822
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,760
But

823
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:25,865
I can’t put you,

824
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,175
Dazheng

825
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,886
and the innocent at risk

826
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:31,639
for my own sake.

827
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,080
If the merfolk can remove

828
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,159
my poison,

829
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,525
I’ll go to Yuezhou to find her.

830
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,879
Don’t drag others in

831
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
and we must

832
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,809
keep it from Haishi.

833
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:49,280
But as far as I know,

834
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,080
she’s the only one

835
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,679
who has seen the merfolk.

836
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,760
I know you don’t want her
to get involved

837
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,639
and I’ve had people

838
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,100
search in the sea.

839
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:57,600
So far,

840
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,775
there’s no sign of the merfolk.

841
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:01,425
All they’ve found are sharks

842
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,280
that can turn boats and swallow humans.

843
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:05,964
You can’t go there alone

844
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:06,879
for one,

845
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,199
you’re too weak to travel that far.

846
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:08,919
And two,

847
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:10,879
without Fang Haishi,

848
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,026
how are you going to find the merfolk?

849
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,959
It is only a theory

850
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,075
that the merfolk

851
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:17,280
can remove Dawn Flower.

852
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
We don’t know that for sure.

853
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,360
Besides,

854
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:21,399
you know

855
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,879
sharks can turn boats

856
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,800
and swallow humans,

857
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,175
so no need for

858
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:27,000
unnecessary sacrifices.

859
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,060
If Haishi found the merfolk

860
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,875
but she couldn’t

861
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,719
remove my poison,

862
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,299
how could Haishi live on

863
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,439
after knowing everything

864
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,199
when I leave?

865
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,725
I’d rather not

866
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:45,725
take any risks.

867
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,560
You’re thinking so much

868
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,439
for Fang Haishi.

869
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,399
That’s all the more reason

870
00:36:49,399 --> 00:36:50,450
to not give up.

871
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,159
Look at me,

872
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,159
Jianming!

873
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,890
I know better than anyone

874
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,120
how it feels to have lost the loved one

875
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,879
and been left alone.

876
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,879
Hadn’t it been for me,

877
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,199
you wouldn’t have suffered so much.

878
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,639
This is my fate.

879
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,320
It has nothing to do with you.

880
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,959
Please

881
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,639
give me some more time.

882
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,360
I’ll find a solution.

883
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,050
But

884
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,320
you cannot

885
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
ask Haishi to look for the merfolk.

886
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,679
You can

887
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,010
work on your solution

888
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,840
but I won’t give up

889
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,360
before we have

890
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,000
a better alternative.

891
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
Sure.

892
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,570
Lord.

893
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,000
Lord,

894
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,361
this is from Young Master Zhuoying.

895
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,040
Dear Master,

896
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:29,919
Lord of Left Pudun, Duoluo,

897
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,225
was eager to conquer Jiaman

898
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,356
whose people fought back hard.

899
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,264
Hanzhou got reshaped.

900
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,675
Thanks to

901
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:39,880
Uncle Earlji’s support,

902
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,600
we used

903
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,400
Duoluo’s loophole to our advantage,

904
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,199
drove the Left Tribe of Huku

905
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,941
out of Lanzi

906
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,995
and formed an alliance with Jiaman.

907
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,950
Ever since I left,

908
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:54,475
I’ve been missing you and Haishi.

909
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,479
How have you been?

910
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,199
I look forward to our reunion.

911
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:02,199
Best regards.

912
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,799
Summon Madam Pearl in!

913
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,919
Greetings, Your Majesty.

914
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,959
Rise.

915
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,679
I’ve read the report

916
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,959
about your work

917
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,159
in the southwest.

918
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,040
You achieved a perfect balance.

919
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,239
I was there on behalf of Your Majesty.

920
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,525
It was my duty

921
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,879
to end the disaster.

922
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,800
Dazheng keeps

923
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,560
the harem from state affairs,

924
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,725
but going back in history,

925
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,600
there are precedents for women

926
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,919
entering politics to serve the nation.

927
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,199
What you did in the southwest

928
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:13,760
is remarkable.

929
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:16,719
You deserve

930
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:17,485
this Imperial Inspector’s Seal

931
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,239
and a spot in court.

932
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:20,719
- She...
- What...?

933
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,800
This is absurd!

934
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:22,800
It’s a huge mistake!

935
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,950
- A woman can’t be in court!
- Politics aren’t for women!

936
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,199
It’s against our tradition!

937
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,280
Chaos will rise!

938
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,280
Agreed.

939
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,320
Your Majesty,

940
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,760
this is a terrible idea.

941
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,990
We’ve never

942
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,325
had a woman in court

943
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:39,275
since the day Dazheng was founded.

944
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,520
Indeed, Your Majesty.

945
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
Our Founding Father wouldn’t allow it.

946
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,679
We can’t have her here.

947
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,600
Didn’t you also support the idea

948
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,639
of having her
handle the disaster relief?

949
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,600
And now, you’re saying

950
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,840
she can’t be in court?

951
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,879
Your Majesty,

952
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,475
that desperate time called for

953
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:57,596
a desperate measure.

954
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,679
But now...

955
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,639
Now,

956
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,279
Fang Haishi has proved

957
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,110
that she’s as capable as men

958
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,895
and able to share my burdens.

959
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:08,000
Why can’t we have her here?

960
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,925
I heard back in Xiping Port,

961
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,320
- even that hard nut Liu Changping
- Madam Pearl

962
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,075
was in awe of her.

963
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:14,550
- has won wide support from the public.
- She’s way above our level.

964
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,439
That’s true. I’ve heard the same thing.

965
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,879
Your Majesty,

966
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:19,760
given Madam Pearl’s outstanding wisdom

967
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,919
and courage,

968
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,040
I believe

969
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,879
her participation in politics

970
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,560
will benefit the state.

971
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,080
No one should stop her.

972
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,840
- We second that.
- We second that.

973
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:31,320
Your Majesty,

974
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,059
I couldn’t have

975
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,825
saved the southwest alone.

976
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:35,719
Your Majesty,

977
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,639
the successful disaster relief

978
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:40,479
is mostly due to
Madam Pearl’s hard work,

979
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,840
but local officials at all levels

980
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,080
also worked diligently

981
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,040
during the process.

982
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,959
Please reward them accordingly.

983
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,850
You have a point, Lord Qinghai.

984
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,040
Their service won’t be forgotten.

985
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,639
Right now,

986
00:41:52,919 --> 00:41:54,840
only Madam Pearl is here.

987
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:57,795
I’ll present the Seal to her first.

988
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

989
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:14,295
I’ll be dedicated

990
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,120
to not letting you down.

991
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,639
You had a long way back.

992
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,159
Now, go back and rest.

993
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,679
Thank you, Your Majesty.

994
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,800
Please excuse me.

995
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,040
I have something to report,
Your Majesty.

996
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,800
Many West Land gold speculators

997
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,639
have committed suicide in the city

998
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,120
due to the plummeting gold price,

999
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
which is setting

1000
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,879
tribes in Leizhou off.

1001
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,520
Their envoys

1002
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,500
have arrived in Tianqi

1003
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,120
and gathered the bereaved

1004
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,840
for an audience with you.

1005
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,479
Your decision is awaited.

1006
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:13,239
Your Majesty,

1007
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,500
if those small tribes

1008
00:43:15,625 --> 00:43:17,345
are to challenge us,

1009
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:20,275
it’ll be like flying moths
darting into the fire.

1010
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:21,719
They’ll be burned.

1011
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,040
I beg to differ.

1012
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,439
Your Majesty,

1013
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,679
as small and weak as they seem,

1014
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,875
they’ll pose a threat to us

1015
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,115
as a coalition.

1016
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,075
On the other hand,

1017
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:34,916
the drought in the southwest
is barely over.

1018
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,080
Things aren’t back to normal yet.

1019
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,481
A war at this time

1020
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,600
will only do more damage

1021
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,439
than good.

1022
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:41,700
Your Majesty,

1023
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,350
the gold price is at an all-time low.

1024
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,475
Those tribes are literally broke.

1025
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,719
War is costly.

1026
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,719
Without gold,

1027
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,120
they can’t support their troops.

1028
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,959
Even if they intend to fight,

1029
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,840
they can’t afford the cost.

1030
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,159
Our gold reserve

1031
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,679
has seriously damaged

1032
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,375
those lurking around

1033
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,800
outside the southwest border.

1034
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,239
That’s a wise move, Your Majesty.

1035
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:02,300
Don’t worry about them.

1036
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,439
It’s only a matter of time

1037
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:04,919
before they’re brought to their knees

1038
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:05,760
and

1039
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,080
prostrate themselves before you.

1040
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,719
Your Majesty,

1041
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,750
Leizhou and Dazheng

1042
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,080
are separated by the Chuliao Sea

1043
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,679
but there’s only

1044
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,750
this narrow Yunwang Strait

1045
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,040
between Leizhou and Xiping Port.

1046
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,575
If tribes there

1047
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:17,475
gang up

1048
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,439
on our southwest gate,

1049
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,239
we’ll be in peril.

1050
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,525
It’s serious, Your Majesty.

1051
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,000
Lord Qinghai,

1052
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,631
what do you think?

1053
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:30,560
In my opinion,

1054
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,300
we should sound those envoys out first.

1055
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,500
Mu Deqing.

1056
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:36,825
Yes, Your Majesty.

1057
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,600
I’m going to meet with

1058
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,840
those envoys at the side hall
of Jincheng Palace

1059
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:42,719
at 9:45 this morning.

1060
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,159
