Fang Haishi!

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,720
Haishi,

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
did someone beat you?

28
00:02:59,279 --> 00:02:59,919
Tell me who did that.

29
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,080
I’ll avenge you.

30
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:01,759
Go away.

31
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,160
You were beaten.

32
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,279
Don’t deny it.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,119
Look at your dark circles.

34
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,240
They’re so severe.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,559
They can even be used as ink.

36
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,080
They are?

37
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,119
Exactly.

38
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:09,639
No way.

39
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,360
Look. Here.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,639
What’s wrong with your neck?

41
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:15,039
Stop. Stop.

42
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,720
Let me massage you.

43
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,360
What happened?

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,960
Is it because of the practice lately?

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,919
It hurts.

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,360
Ma... Master?

47
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,479
Master.

48
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,199
Aren’t you on duty today?

49
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,039
I’m not on duty today.

50
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,720
Now that you’re not on duty,

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
go to the drill ground with me

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
and let’s compete.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,679
Remember,

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
Haishi is your younger brother.

55
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,000
Don’t go too far.

56
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,839
Master,

57
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
I suddenly remember that

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,479
Shaozi asked to see me.

59
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,800
I’ll leave you alone.

60
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,279
Master,

61
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,479
I’ll get to my business, too.

62
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,479
Haishi,

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,320
I taught you to keep still
in deep meditation last night.

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,479
Did it help?

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,919
Yes. Yes.

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,559
Were you still sleepless
with too many dreams?

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,240
No.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
No, no.

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,759
I’m going to the Palace
for some business.

70
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,320
You can get to your business.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
When Master is going to the Palace,

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
I can go and check

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,959
who the assassins were

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,679
on the Lantern Festival.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,720
One more time.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Your Majesty.

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,799
Boring.

78
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,000
Wait here for me.

79
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,000
I’ll be back later.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,399
Yes.

81
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,119
Yes.

82
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,239
Leave us.

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

84
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,239
Go, go, go.

85
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:37,720
Be seated.

86
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,920
Take off your mask.

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,399
Jichang is coming back.

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
Send your men to pick him up.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,519
Yes.

90
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,559
I didn’t only summon you

91
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,440
for this.

92
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,160
A princess of Zhunian

93
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,600
will come with him.

94
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,640
Do it the same old way.

95
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,440
But Your Majesty...

96
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
The king of Zhunian is rude

97
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,079
and he wants to interfere

98
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,119
with my family business

99
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,679
when Jichang is coming back.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,839
It’s been so many years.

101
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,920
For Zizan’s sake,

102
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,920
I’ve been tolerating Zhunian.

103
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
But in this world,

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,320
no other girl will be like Zizan.

105
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,160
If he wants

106
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:00,519
to have Zizan replaced,

107
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,000
he’s having the wrong plan.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,640
The princess is innocent.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,959
Besides,

110
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,519
it concerns the harmony
between Zhunian and us.

111
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,160
Harmony?

112
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,720
Zhunian is such a small state.

113
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,679
You’re thinking too highly of them.

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,760
You’re the emperor of the world.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don’t need to overestimate Zhunian.

116
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,239
But Zhunian

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,119
is the closest to our state.

118
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,480
Half of the peace of the south

119
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,799
owes to them.

120
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,880
This isn’t appropriate.

121
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,880
Please think again, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,760
I’ve made up my mind.

123
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,519
Just do it.

124
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:33,959
Your Majesty,

125
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,359
it’s about the fate of our state.

126
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:36,519
Besides, Princess Tilan is

127
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,359
the biological sister of the Empress.

128
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,760
For the sake of the Empress...

129
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,200
How daring!

130
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,600
How dare you bring Zizan up!

131
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,760
I just don’t want to see you

132
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,600
so depressed.

133
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,720
You call yourself a good official now?

134
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,839
How shameless you are!

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,079
You think

136
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,079
you’re still the lord?

137
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,600
Or you’re still

138
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,959
the important official
who helped me get the throne?

139
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,079
Look at you.

140
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Now,

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
you’re nothing,

142
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
but a rat in the gutter.

143
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:20,440
You’re my minion in the dark.

144
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,519
I know my duty.

145
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,720
Duty?

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,600
If you really know your duty,

147
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,960
do as I told you.

148
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:36,880
I...

149
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
I just want Jichang to come back safely.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,239
I’ll leave you alone, Your Majesty.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
Go away!

152
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,200
Why are you out in such a thin dress?

153
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,799
This year,

154
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
the war condition is tense.

155
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,559
The Lantern Festival
was celebrated simply.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,760
I’m sorry.

157
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,280
It wasn’t.

158
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,799
You made the lantern yourself.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,559
Even if you made only one,

160
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,000
it’s better than all the other ones.

161
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,520
Really?

162
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,719
It has a good meaning, too.

163
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,320
The lantern you made

164
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,280
is to catch someone’s heart.

165
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,200
It’s snowing now

166
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,919
and it symbolizes
we’ll grow old together.

167
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,479
In total, it means

168
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,280
catching one’s heart

169
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,039
and never being apart.

170
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,159
Let go of me!

171
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,679
The net is made

172
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,080
of refined steel wire.

173
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,239
Not to mention you,

174
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,559
even some sharks

175
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,760
can’t break it.

176
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,559
Hey,

177
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,880
if you kidnap us,

178
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,840
you’ll be doing a horrible crime!

179
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,039
You sound tough.

180
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,440
Who are you?

181
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,760
Confess.

182
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,280
Who instigated you?

183
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,760
What are you talking about?

184
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,159
We don’t understand.

185
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,799
You don’t understand?

186
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,280
You have one more chance.

187
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,080
Who instigated you?

188
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
Why did you do the assassination

189
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,679
at the lantern fair
of the Lantern Festival?

190
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,320
What? What assassination?

191
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,640
Sir,

192
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,719
it’s such a big crime.

193
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,880
We can’t bear it.

194
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Yeah.

195
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,159
Still denying?

196
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,320
Fine.

197
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,559
Spare us, sir!

198
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,640
Spare us!

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,799
Will you confess or not?

200
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,159
I will.

201
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
I’ll confess. I will.

202
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:45,719
We...

203
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
Master.

204
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,359
Crawl back and tell your master

205
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,840
to stop from now on.

206
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,640
And I’ll let him go.

207
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,760
If he keeps making trouble,

208
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,760
I won’t easily let him go

209
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,080
as I did before.

210
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,520
- Go.
- Go.

211
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,320
Master.

212
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,359
Go back with me.

213
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,039
- Commander.
- Commander.

214
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,039
Master.

215
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,640
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

216
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,679
Master, your hand...

217
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,159
What do I usually teach you?

218
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,119
Do you remember?

219
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,080
Every order is executed without failure.

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,039
Every order is effectively enforced.

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,039
Now that you knew it

222
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,000
and made a mistake deliberately,

223
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,840
what punishment do you deserve?

224
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,239
Those men have malicious intentions.

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
I was just worried about you.

226
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,799
Go reflect on yourself in your room.

227
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,880
Copy the rules 200 times.

228
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,679
Your turn. Your turn.

229
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,599
How about another roll?

230
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,440
You indeed annoyed Master?

231
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,520
Continue.

232
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,479
Fang Haishi.

233
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,239
I nearly took away

234
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,159
all your chess pieces.

235
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,159
Will you continue or not?

236
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,280
Fang Haishi!

237
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:41,000
Master, you must be tired.

238
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,320
Time to take a rest.

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,080
If you don’t want to play chess,

240
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,119
why not bet with me?

241
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,440
Master, guess.

242
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,760
In which hand is the black piece?

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,799
If you guess it wrong,

244
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,919
I’ll win.

245
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,280
If I win,

246
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,719
promise me one thing.

247
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:57,520
In the future,

248
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,000
no matter what mistake I make,

249
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,359
you can curse me and punish me,

250
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,840
but don’t ignore me.

251
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,840
What do you think, Master?

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,479
In your right hand.

253
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,119
I win!

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,359
It’s a deal, then.

255
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,760
You mustn’t ignore me anymore.

256
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,200
Open your left hand.

257
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,440
Master.

258
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,760
Here it is.

259
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,000
Commander.

260
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,400
His Majesty asked you

261
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,080
to go to the Palace for the mission

262
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,119
with the executor.

263
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
Zhuoying, come with me.

264
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,239
I’ve marked

265
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,719
the important passes and routes

266
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,559
on the map.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,799
Bring the map back

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,880
and get ready.

269
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,799
When the decree of His Majesty comes,

270
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,919
gather your men and set out.

271
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,760
This is a very important mission.

272
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,799
It concerns the harmony
between Zhunian and us.

273
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,959
No mistake can be made.

274
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,359
You must remember

275
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,119
what I usually teach you.

276
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Yes, Master.

277
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,040
Besides,

278
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,560
if His Majesty has

279
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,599
any other mission for you,

280
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,199
don’t question him.

281
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
I get it.

282
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,079
Master.

283
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,400
I’d like to go
in place of Fang Zhuoying.

284
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,880
Don’t make trouble.

285
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,239
I’d like to make amends
for previous faults

286
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,319
and I won’t let you down.

287
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,640
Are you a fool?

288
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,160
This isn’t a good job.

289
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,599
If you’re hurt,

290
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,520
what will you do?

291
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,319
Master,

292
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,439
in my opinion,

293
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,719
as long as I’m half sure

294
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,040
about something,

295
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,199
I’ll have a try.

296
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,400
In the vocabulary of Jifeng Pavilion,

297
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,599
there’s no such word

298
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,920
as “try”.

299
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,599
We’re always 100% sure.

300
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,560
If you can defeat Zhuoying,

301
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,959
you can go in place of him.

302
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,079
Master!

303
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,160
Haishi,

304
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,560
I’m your older brother.

305
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,719
But in a competition,

306
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,000
I won’t concede.

307
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,959
Nor will I.

308
00:18:18,479 --> 00:18:19,160
Give it your best.

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,359
Haishi,

310
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,239
stop.

311
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Or you’ll get hurt.

312
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,199
I won.

313
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,160
Master, I won.

314
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,560
Let me do the mission.

315
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,400
Hand over the ferule to me.

316
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,599
Master, what mistake did I make?

317
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,079
Put your hand out.

318
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,640
Master,

319
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,359
you said war allows deceit.

320
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,199
You also said we could...

321
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,920
Master,

322
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,439
let go of Haishi this time.

323
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,839
If you were fighting an enemy,

324
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,520
would you concede?

325
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,199
I wouldn’t.

326
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:01,959
Do you know

327
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:02,920
what mistake you made?

328
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:03,920
Master,

329
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,760
I know I made a mistake.

330
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,439
Zhuoying said

331
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
he wouldn’t concede to me.

332
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,520
But at the critical moment,

333
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,719
he conceded.

334
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,359
It’s brotherhood.

335
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:16,319
So, we can’t only obey rules.

336
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,199
We should also care
for reasons and justice.

337
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,000
Are you ready to be punished?

338
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,599
Yes.

339
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,680
Go reflect on yourself
in the silence room

340
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,400
and copy the rules 200 times.

341
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,160
You’re grounded until you finish.

342
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,239
Shaozi,

343
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,640
am I really far worse

344
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,760
than Zhuoying?

345
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,839
Why does Master

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,719
never give me

347
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,800
any missions?

348
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,359
In terms of martial arts,

349
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,760
you’re indeed inferior
to Young Master Zhuoying

350
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,520
in skills and strength.

351
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,319
But you’re responsive

352
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,359
and agile.

353
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,319
You’re also doing good

354
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,560
in adapting to circumstances.

355
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,079
As for why does Commander

356
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,839
never give you any missions,

357
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,079
I guess he has

358
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,719
his own consideration.

359
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,479
Shaozi,

360
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,239
Zhuoying is going

361
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,280
to pick up the Fourth Prince
and Princess of Zhunian

362
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,560
by order of His Majesty.

363
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,319
When are they coming back?

364
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:21,599
Haishi,

365
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
you know

366
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,319
the rules of Jifeng Pavilion.

367
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,599
Besides Commander,

368
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
only the executor

369
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,239
knows his mission.

370
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,040
But you keep asking.

371
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:31,920
Are you expecting

372
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,880
to copy the rules another 200 times?

373
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,280
No.

374
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,280
Shall I invite you

375
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,160
to have a drink in Zuixian Restaurant?

376
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,319
We can go there

377
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,800
after you finish copying the rules.

378
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,280
I’ll go lock the door.

379
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,640
The same old rule.

380
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,959
Before you finish,

381
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,520
you can’t come out!

382
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,319
Thank you, then.

383
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,839
Palace Minister Fang Zhuoying

384
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,800
is promoted as Bowmen Commandant

385
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,280
and Escorting Envoy.

386
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,800
He’s given the commander’s tally.

387
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,160
He’ll go to Xiping Port with the army

388
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,839
and welcome the Fourth Prince back.

389
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Respect this.

390
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,439
Thank you, Your Majesty.

391
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,239
Fang Zhuoying.

392
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,640
Yes.

393
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,239
Do you know

394
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,800
what you’re going to do

395
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,400
as the Escorting Envoy?

396
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,319
I’m going to get back Prince Jichang

397
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,160
and Princess Tilan who will marry you.

398
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,640
I only want you

399
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,040
to do one thing.

400
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,000
Get Jichang back.

401
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,000
Escorting Envoy is simply a title.

402
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,760
I don’t want to see
the Princess of Zhunian

403
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,520
come to Tianqi City.

404
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,239
Do you get it?

405
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,239
- I...
- As for the rest,

406
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,479
do it according to your rules.

407
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,319
Yes, Your Majesty.

408
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,599
Look.

409
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,479
You and Fang Zhu both work
for Jifeng Pavilion.

410
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,520
Why are you

411
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,760
far more flexible

412
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,800
than your master?

413
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,319
Go ahead.

414
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
When you’re back,

415
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
maybe you can

416
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,839
get a noble title

417
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,280
with your true talent.

418
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

419
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,800
Look.

420
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,359
That girl looks so beautiful.

421
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,800
She’s got nice eyes.

422
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,839
Is she a new maid?

423
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,280
She’s so pretty.

424
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,599
What a beautiful girl!

425
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,520
What a beautiful girl!

426
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,719
Which palace does she work in?

427
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,640
Yeah.

428
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,640
Losers.

429
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,319
Here.

430
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,839
This way, please.

431
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,319
Greetings, Madam.

432
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:01,719
Liu.

433
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:02,959
Stand up.

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,560
Let me look at you.

435
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,400
You’ve grown up.

436
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,800
I will

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,920
stay with you

438
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,520
and serve you.

439
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,719
Liu,

440
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:20,920
I used to teach you

441
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,319
some methods of embroidery.

442
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,599
Do you still remember them?

443
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,040
At first,

444
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,520
I recited the methods

445
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,359
you taught me every day

446
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,839
until I memorized them thoroughly.

447
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
Then I practiced with pore yarn

448
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,439
so that I could do gently

449
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,920
and not damage the yarn.

450
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
You’re talented

451
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,680
and you’re patient.

452
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,199
You’ll distinguish yourself.

453
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,119
Master,

454
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,800
after taking the imperial edict,

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,520
I asked my vice general
to gather the army

456
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,079
and we’re leaving immediately.

457
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,119
After I leave today,

458
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,199
I can’t take care of you

459
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,359
for quite a long while.

460
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,119
Please take good care of yourself

461
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,680
and don’t burn yourself out.

462
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,920
You look energetic.

463
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
That’s what I expected.

464
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,199
Master,

465
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:07,439
I have some confusion.

466
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,439
Say it.

467
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,239
Before I left the Palace,

468
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,319
His Majesty told me

469
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,239
to follow our old rules

470
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,839
and I could get a noble title

471
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:19,079
if I did a good job.

472
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Master, you know me.

473
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,479
I don’t care about that.

474
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,160
Tilan came to marry His Majesty.

475
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,479
If Zhunian is forced to rebel,

476
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,959
I’m afraid they will

477
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,160
contact southwestern tribes

478
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,959
and cause trouble.

479
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,400
His Majesty thinks

480
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,160
Zhunian people don’t dare to rebel.

481
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,239
What if they do?

482
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:37,160
Master,

483
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,400
if they rebel,

484
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,839
there’s Huku in the north.

485
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,880
Southwestern tribes in the south

486
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,040
will collude with Zhunian

487
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,880
and besiege us.

488
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,000
Our army

489
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,520
will be stuck in trouble.

490
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,160
You’ve indeed grown up

491
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,640
and you care for the big picture now.

492
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,479
News came from the southwest

493
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,680
that Huku and some southwestern tribes

494
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,520
are sowing dissension everywhere.

495
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,280
They say that our state and Zhunian
will certainly unite

496
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,119
and later swallow up those tribes.

497
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,719
Kings of southwestern tribes

498
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,520
are already suffering from fears.

499
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,199
When you go to escort the Princess,

500
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,520
I’m afraid there’ll be a lot of trouble.

501
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,719
As what His Majesty told you,

502
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,719
just keep Prince Jichang safe.

503
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,719
For the rest of the thing,

504
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,479
I’ve got a plan.

505
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,239
Yes, Master.

506
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,640
Time to go.

507
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,160
Yes.

508
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,000
Commander.

509
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,719
Commander.

510
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
What is it? Say it.

511
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
His Majesty suddenly wanted

512
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,479
to enjoy the hot spring

513
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,359
in Shuixin Palace.

514
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,199
Guards of Jifeng Pavilion
are asked to protect His Majesty.

515
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:36,920
Led by you,

516
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,880
everyone should be ready

517
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,119
and leave tomorrow morning.

518
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,199
Master...

519
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,359
Did His Majesty say

520
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,560
when we would come back?

521
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,880
No.

522
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Master!

523
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,599
Master,

524
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,079
I’ve done copying the rules.

525
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,079
Master,

526
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,520
I know I’m sorry.

527
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,400
I shouldn’t have made use

528
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,040
of Zhuoying’s concern for me.

529
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:04,880
This time,

530
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
he’s going so far

531
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,920
for such a dangerous mission.

532
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,199
I wonder

533
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,040
if you can send me, too.

534
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,239
As his subordinate,

535
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:14,199
I’ll be able to help a lot.

536
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,000
Go back to the silence room
and keep copying.

537
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,040
Let’s go.

538
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,319
But Master!

539
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,119
You...

540
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:25,959
It’s your fault.

541
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
His Majesty

542
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,640
made us

543
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,239
the Escorting Envoys.

544
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,920
We’re going to Xiping Port

545
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,239
to welcome the Fourth Prince
and Princess of Zhunian.

546
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,760
It will be a very long trip.

547
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,959
I’ll make concerted efforts with you

548
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,760
and show our national prestige!

549
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,599
National prestige!

550
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,319
National prestige!

551
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,280
National prestige!

552
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,520
Off we go!

553
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,680
My lord,

554
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,040
we’re done with encamping.

555
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,439
All right.

556
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:35,239
Put up the pots for cooking

557
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,520
and be on duty in shifts.

558
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,359
Yes.

559
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,920
Fang Zhuoying?

560
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Fang Haishi?

561
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Why are you here?

562
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,479
Don’t lie to me.

563
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,560
Master asked you

564
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,040
not to come with us.

565
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,040
You know what?

566
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,760
Shortly after you left,

567
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:11,880
Master and Shaozi

568
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,280
also left for a mission.

569
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,319
I wonder

570
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,319
if your mission

571
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,760
is so hard

572
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,680
that Master wants to help you secretly.

573
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,719
However hard the mission is,

574
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,079
I’ll try my best to complete it.

575
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,040
But you...

576
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,439
Don’t you fear Master will punish you

577
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,920
for sneaking out alone?

578
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,239
Anyway,

579
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:30,640
Master isn’t in Jifeng Pavilion.

580
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,959
No one restrains me.

581
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,640
So,

582
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,560
I came to you

583
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:34,599
for some experience.

584
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,199
Master has informers
throughout the world.

585
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,439
When you sneaked out,

586
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,119
do you really think

587
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,239
Master didn’t know?

588
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,680
Even if he knows,

589
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,160
he’ll just punish me.

590
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,880
He’ll ignore me, in the worst case.

591
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,319
Don’t worry.

592
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,839
I’ll take full responsibility.

593
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,439
I won’t get you implicated.

594
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,359
Besides,

595
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,199
Master didn’t allow me to come.

596
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,000
He didn’t forbid me, either.

597
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,599
Here I am now.

598
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,520
Don’t try to threaten me with Master

599
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,280
and drive me back.

600
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,280
Also,

601
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,239
here we are

602
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,439
in the southwest of Dazheng.

603
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,280
If you drive me away,

604
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,400
I’ll go to Xiping Port alone

605
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,560
to pick up the Fourth Prince

606
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,079
and Princess of Zhunian.

607
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,199
Fang Haishi...

608
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,760
Fang Zhuoying, I’m hungry.

609
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,439
All the way here,

610
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,719
you could cook with the pots.

611
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,160
But I had to live in the wilderness.

612
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,359
What a poor life!

613
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,839
Go check

614
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,599
if the meal is ready. Go.

615
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,359
I’m full!

616
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,319
You’ve eaten so much.

617
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,719
Before we reach Xiping Port,

618
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
we’ll have no food.

619
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,319
I not only want a big meal,

620
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,160
but also a good sleep.

621
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
From tomorrow on,

622
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,280
you’ll be my bodyguard.

623
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,119
Remember.

624
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:42,119
Without my permission,

625
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:42,959
you mustn’t run about.

626
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,119
Yes.

627
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,719
Get to sleep.

628
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,199
We’ll resume our journey tomorrow.

629
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,839
Isn’t this your camp?

630
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,079
It’s yours now.

631
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,520
Thanks.

632
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:15,800
Mr. Chen,

633
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,520
the Fourth Prince
and Princess of Zhunian have arrived.

634
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,479
Good.

635
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,839
When it’s the propitious moment,

636
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
open the city gate

637
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,479
and welcome the Fourth Prince.

638
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Yes.

639
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,959
This way, my lord.

640
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,000
After you.

641
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
I’m Chen Heran, Prefect of Xiping Port.

642
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,439
I’m Bowmen Commandant Fang Zhuoying.

643
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,239
Welcome back, Your Highness.

644
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,080
Stand up, please.

645
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
Stand up, please.

646
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,120
It’s the will of heaven

647
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,760
that Fourth Prince Chu Jichang
has come back to Dazheng.

648
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,360
It’s the propitious moment.

649
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,560
His Highness shall give a salute,

650
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,280
to celebrate his return.

651
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,280
Go ahead, please.

652
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,040
Kneel!

653
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,560
Light the incense!

654
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Make a toast!

655
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,159
Kowtow!

656
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,719
Rise!

657
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,760
The ceremony is over!

658
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,639
What a big ceremony!

659
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,040
Thank you.

660
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:50,919
However,

661
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,560
I have a gift for him, too.

662
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:53,879
Come on.

663
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
Look.

664
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,360
It’s the eagle egg

665
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,800
I carefully picked.

666
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,560
When the eagle hatches,

667
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,479
I’ll give it to my brother.

668
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,360
Your Highness,
you were away from Dazheng,

669
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,840
but you cared for His Majesty.

670
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,959
The relationship between you

671
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,959
is quite touching.

672
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,760
Greetings, envoys. I’m Tang Qianzi.

673
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,919
Thank you.

674
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,719
Your Highness, you’ve been taking

675
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,080
a bumpy voyage lately.

676
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
I’ve prepared rooms

677
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:28,280
for you and Her Highness.

678
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,800
You can stay in Jubei Town

679
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:30,639
for a couple of days

680
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
before we leave for Tianqi City.

681
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,800
I’ve been away
from my hometown for years.

682
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,199
I wish I could set out immediately

683
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:37,199
and go back to Tianqi City

684
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,679
to meet my brother.

685
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
It’s getting dark already.

686
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
Please allow us to receive you

687
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:44,320
and get ready for the trip.

688
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,679
How about leaving tomorrow

689
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,719
for Tianqi City?

690
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,439
All right, then.

691
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,959
See you, Your Highness.

692
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:58,919
Your Highness,

693
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,199
this way, please!

694
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,439
I’m Chen Heran, Prefect of Xiping Port.

695
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,600
I’m Bowmen Commandant Fang Zhuoying.

696
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,879
Greetings, Your Highness.

697
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,959
You may rise.

698
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Your Highness, you had a long journey

699
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,199
and you must be tried.

700
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:31,879
I’ve prepared

701
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,560
a room for you.

702
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,879
Please take some rest today.

703
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
We’re leaving for Tianqi City tomorrow.

704
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,320
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

705
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,320
Your Highness,

706
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,959
this way, please.

707
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,280
At ease.

708
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Her Highness is wearing a veil.

709
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,120
But look at her figure and elegance.

710
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,040
She must be gorgeous.

711
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,239
Why does a beautiful girl like her

712
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,560
cover her face?

713
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:07,800
Her Highness is noble

714
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,919
and hasn’t got married yet.

715
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,199
She certainly covers her face.

716
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,639
Her headwear weighs

717
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
a dozen kilos, I guess.

718
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Even her neck bends.

719
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:15,840
It’s better to be a man.

720
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,199
Haishi.

721
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,919
You...

722
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,280
Even if you wear gold hairpins,

723
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,080
no one will notice you.

724
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:29,199
Fang Zhuoying!

725
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,280
Zhuoying,

726
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,959
do you find it

727
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,320
a little bit weird?

728
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,080
Weird?

729
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:45,639
The return of the Fourth Prince

730
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,560
and marriage of the Princess of Zhunian

731
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,239
will benefit our state

732
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:50,760
and bring peace.

733
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,879
But along the way,

734
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,199
I heard many civilians say

735
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,520
they had seen a lot of strange ships

736
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,760
and the number of unknown businessmen

737
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,120
had increased sharply.

738
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:05,520
Is someone trying to ruin the marriage?

739
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,280
Actually,

740
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,879
Master expected this.

741
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,840
He did?

742
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:13,639
Yes.

743
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,320
Huku and some southwestern tribes

744
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,120
fear the second marriage

745
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,760
between Zhunian and Dazheng.

746
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:22,080
They’re afraid

747
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Zhunian and Dazheng would unite.

748
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:26,280
So, they want to ruin it.

749
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:28,120
The way back to Tianqi City

750
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,360
isn’t supposed to be smooth.

751
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:32,360
His Majesty only asked me

752
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,600
to keep the Fourth Prince safe.

753
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,600
But about Her Highness...

754
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,679
What does His Majesty mean?

755
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,639
All right.

756
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,919
Think no more of it.

757
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:46,919
Let’s drink.

758
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,479
Who’s that?

759
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,080
Mr. Fang, it’s me,

760
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,399
Chen Heran.

761
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,479
Mr. Fang?

762
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,360
This is my younger brother, Fang Haishi.

763
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,280
Haishi,

764
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,439
greet Prefect Chen of Xiping Port.

765
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,239
Greetings, Mr. Chen.

766
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,159
Mr. Fang,

767
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:14,080
I didn’t expect you

768
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,040
to have

769
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,040
such a handsome brother.

770
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,320
He doesn’t

771
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,719
look like you at all.

772
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:20,800
Mr. Chen,

773
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,320
you get him wrong.

774
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:23,840
My brother is excellent

775
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,199
in literature and martial arts.

776
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,199
He wants to serve our state.

777
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,239
He came with me,

778
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,560
because he wanted to get some trials

779
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,399
in the army.

780
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,959
If he competes with you in martial arts,

781
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:32,639
I don’t think

782
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,280
you can defeat him.

783
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,840
Don’t let him fool you.

784
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,679
Shall we borrow some soldiers
from Mr. Chen?

785
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,080
Borrow soldiers from me?

786
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,120
What for?

787
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:46,639
Mr. Chen,

788
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,040
we’re not familiar

789
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,000
with Xiping Port.

790
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,280
Inadequate soldiers may cause accidents

791
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,399
on our way back to Tianqi City.

792
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,760
Please transfer some soldiers

793
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,120
to escort the Fourth Prince

794
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,360
and Princess Tilan back to Tianqi City.

795
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:02,159
This is a serious matter.

796
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,600
Please go to the government office
for further discussion.

797
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,199
Mr. Chen,

798
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,959
how many soldiers can you get

799
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:13,919
to protect the Fourth Prince?

800
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,080
A thousand.

801
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,639
Only a thousand?

802
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:17,840
Young Master Haishi,

803
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,679
Xiping is a port.

804
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,479
Most soldiers are marines
who aren’t good at land battles.

805
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,679
There’re lands and hills to go

806
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:23,919
from here to Tianqi City.

807
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,560
I don’t have many infantrymen
or cavalrymen.

808
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,479
Besides, His Majesty commanded us

809
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,800
to enhance the defense
of the southwestern coast.

810
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:32,239
Giving you a thousand soldiers

811
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,919
is already the best I can do.

812
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,280
All right, then.

813
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:37,919
That’ll be enough.

814
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,000
Mr. Chen,

815
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,000
how will you dispatch

816
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,120
these soldiers?

817
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,199
Please look at the map, Mr. Chen.

818
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:51,679
This is the junction

819
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,239
of Feiyun River and Lanzhui River.

820
00:42:53,439 --> 00:42:55,000
It’s the shortest route to Tianqi City.

821
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,000
It’s also the most dangerous place.

822
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,360
We can use camouflage here,

823
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,320
by taking three routes

824
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,360
as cover-up.

825
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,560
The Fourth Prince will
take the first route.

826
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,280
The team for His Highness

827
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,000
should be simple.

828
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,719
(Xiping Port)
They avoid the short cut of the river valley.

829
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,040
(Miyang, Jiangming)
Through the narrow part of Feiyun River,

830
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:17,800
(Chutang Plain)
they’re going to past Chutang Plain,

831
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,479
(Kaiyang, Mount Anlan)
Mount Anlan,

832
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,800
(Mount Leiyan)
and Mount Leiyan.

833
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,959
(Shangyang Pass)
They’ll join the team

834
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,239
in Shangyang Pass.

835
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,719
(Xiping Port)
The second team

836
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,683
(Miyang, Jiangming)
goes to Chutang Plain through the south

837
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:29,959
(Miyang, Jiangming)
of the river valley.

838
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,040
(Chutang Plain)
I’ll lead some soldiers

839
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,120
to keep a low profile
during the journey.

840
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,239
We’ll escort Princess Tilan
to Tianqi City,

841
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,639
in disguise of transferring
tributes of Zhunian.

842
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,239
The third team is the last to leave

843
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,560
in the grandest way.

844
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,679
My brother will be disguised
as Princess Tilan

845
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,239
and set out from the courier hostel.

846
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:47,719
He’ll go

847
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,000
through the noisiest East Gate.

848
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,800
(Jubei Town)

849
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,399
By then,

850
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,120
someone will disguise himself
as the Fourth Prince

851
00:43:52,399 --> 00:43:53,800
and travel with the Princess.

852
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,040
Uncle Zhao,

853
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,919
how’s it going?

854
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:08,719
The landform here doesn’t look like

855
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,080
there can be an ambush.

856
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,679
But we still need to be cautious.

857
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,080
We’re in the open

858
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,479
while the enemies are undercover.

859
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,840
Young Master Haishi,

860
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,199
after getting Princess Tilan

861
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:21,600
and Prince Jichang,

862
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,080
I’m leaving Jifeng Pavilion.

863
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:25,719
You’re leaving?

864
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:27,399
I’m getting old

865
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,840
and I can no longer work hard.

866
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,479
I’ve had enough

867
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,479
of such a dangerous life on the run.

868
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,120
I want a chance

869
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,520
to travel around the state.

870
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,679
That’s good.

871
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,520
Traveling around

872
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,879
is a nice thing, anyway.

873
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:46,679
Young Master Haishi,

874
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,159
according to rules,

875
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:51,080
I shouldn’t have said goodbye to you.

876
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
Please don’t mind.

877
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
Don’t say that.

878
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:57,000
If you need anything,

879
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,479
come to me at any time.

880
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,520
Thank you.

881
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:04,679
Gee!

882
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,520
Protect Her Highness!

883
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:57,639
Protect Her Highness!

884
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:24,399
Mr. Fang!

885
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:25,199
Leave, Your Highness!

886
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:35,879
Young Master Haishi,

887
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,199
I don’t have many infantrymen
or cavalrymen.

888
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,399
Besides, His Majesty commanded us

889
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,199
to enhance the defense
of the southwestern coast.

890
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:43,560
Giving you a thousand soldiers

891
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,280
is already the best I can do.

892
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,959
I’ll go give an order

893
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,120
to get everything prepared.

894
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,439
See you.

895
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:53,199
See you.

896
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,399
Screwed.

897
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,040
