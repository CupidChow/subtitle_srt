25

Get out of here!

26
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,720
You showed up

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,479
just as Lord expected.

28
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,759
Here you are

29
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,839
while your master is long gone,

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
leaving you as bait

31
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,639
to distract others.

32
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,360
Lackeys like you

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
don’t get to know who we serve.

34
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,000
Leader,

35
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,600
did Master leave without us?

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,000
Master...

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
Master would never

38
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,960
abandon us.

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,880
You want a name?

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,559
Fine.

41
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,279
I’ll tell you.

42
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,520
It’s Manager Ju Qiqi at Fabric Office.

43
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,240
All this

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,919
is her plan.

45
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,479
Oh, no!

46
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,119
Fabric Office!

47
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,279
Unbelievable!

48
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,559
How dare they

49
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,679
murder a house of maids

50
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,359
right under my nose!

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Unless

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
someone has eyes and ears

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,160
all over the palace

54
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,839
and assets under deep cover

55
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,880
right next to me!

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,239
What do we know so far?

57
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Your Majesty,

58
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,399
I’ve traced those assassins

59
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:37,279
back to their leader, Wu Qi,

60
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,000
who kept them

61
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,200
for years.

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,119
All of them

63
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,399
and members of Fabric Office

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,279
were killed by the same poison.

65
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
That’s it?

66
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,799
I don’t need that!

67
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,040
What I need

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
is the name of the mastermind.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Your Majesty,

70
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,119
one embroiderer at Fabric Office

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,440
had very little poison

72
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,279
and could still breathe
when I found her.

73
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,320
She’s being treated as we speak.

74
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,359
Once she wakes up,

75
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,119
she’ll give us more leads to work with.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,119
Check everyone in the palace.

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Bring all Wu Qi’s accomplices
to justice!

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

79
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,799
Your safety is guaranteed.

80
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,920
Guards have been replaced

81
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,160
to tighten the security.

82
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,679
You can trust

83
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,119
everyone around you.

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,320
Jianming,

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,279
we should’ve never

86
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,119
been lenient.

87
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,480
You’re up!

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
Master,

89
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:26,640
I’m too tough

90
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,600
to die.

91
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,600
We’re all worried sick about you.

92
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,359
I’m glad you’re awake.

93
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,279
Master,

94
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,160
I don’t regret it.

95
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,640
What do you mean?

96
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,959
When I was half-awake,

97
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,959
I vaguely heard you saying

98
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:54,760
I would’ve regretted running into you.

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,079
You should know

100
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,959
whatever happened to me

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,920
has nothing to do with others.

102
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,880
Meeting you

103
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,799
is one of the few best things

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,160
that have ever happened to me.

105
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,799
Master,

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,679
I’d never regret it.

107
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn’t,

108
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,600
I don’t

109
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,320
and

110
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,159
I’ll never regret meeting you.

111
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
You could’ve died.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,039
Don’t say that.

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760
All the more reason

114
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,440
to let it out now

115
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,719
when I still can

116
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,479
before it’s too late.

117
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,479
Master...

118
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,200
Relax.

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320
I’ll be right back.

120
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,239
Here’s Young Master Haishi’s medicine.

121
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,919
Got any word from Zhuoying

122
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,200
or Zhang Chengqian?

123
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,280
No, Lord.

124
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Not yet.

125
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,159
Put the word out

126
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
that Mr. Fang is awake

127
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,159
and he’s stable.

128
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,039
Yes.

129
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Your wound is still fresh. Don’t move.

130
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,200
Take your medicine.

131
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,320
Are you all right? Is it too hot?

132
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,880
No, just bitter.

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Master,

134
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,119
you’re frowning again.

135
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,599
I’m sorry

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,200
for letting Earlji go

137
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,479
and worrying you all so much.

138
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
Don’t do that ever again.

139
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,880
I never said
to save others with your life.

140
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,119
Finish your medicine.

141
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,239
I’ve learned my lesson.

142
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,960
(Postal Relay Station)

143
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,320
Let’s drink.

144
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,880
- Here. Fill the cup.
- Fill it.

145
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
Come on.

146
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,520
Mr. Su won’t be back

147
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
anytime soon.

148
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:22,840
Let’s drink, guys!

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,719
- Yes! Cheers!
- Cheers!

150
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,119
Where’s Su Ming?

151
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:41,320
Officer,

152
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,679
what’s this about? Don’t hurt us.

153
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,359
Who are you

154
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,000
to ask about Mr. Su’s whereabouts?

155
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,119
Don’t make me ask again.

156
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,719
Uh... Mr. Su

157
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,559
had the boat ready yesterday.

158
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,520
He and his five assistants

159
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,960
are heading to Shangzhou by water.

160
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,080
Your Highness! Your Highness!

161
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,679
Your Highness!

162
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
What’s the emergency?

163
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,640
Bad news, Your Highness!

164
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,080
Bihong is arguing

165
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
with a few eunuchs at North Garden Lane.

166
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,559
It’s our lost kite.

167
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,919
It got out from Yu’an Palace.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,840
(Flowered forehead is from last night.)
Look, it’s inscribed!

169
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,799
Miss,

170
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,359
please don’t make it hard for us.

171
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,320
Eunuch Mu

172
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,479
asked us

173
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,359
to deliver this kite to His Majesty.

174
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,520
How dare you

175
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,039
try to intercept it!

176
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,960
I mean, it’s just a kite!

177
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,719
“Just a kite”?

178
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,239
It’s...

179
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,960
Bihong,

180
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,119
you were supposed to come back

181
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:52,479
after collecting things
from the Storehouse,

182
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,479
yet here you are bickering with others.

183
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,640
Your Highness,

184
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,239
they found our kite.

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,440
I asked them to return it

186
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,119
but they refused to.

187
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,920
(Flowered forehead is from last night.)
(Behind the screen window she smiles brightly.)

188
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,520
That’s not ours.

189
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,119
It’s just a kite.

190
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:07,840
Don’t make a fuss

191
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
about it.

192
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,640
Behave yourself

193
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,479
or you’ll be punished!

194
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,679
But...

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,400
Let her finish.

196
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

197
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,599
Greetings, Your Majesty.

198
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:22,159
What’s this all about?

199
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Show me. Let me see.

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,479
You three, come over.

201
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,000
But what?

202
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,200
I’m giving you a chance

203
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,559
to finish your sentence.

204
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,520
Your Majesty, that kite

205
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,359
flew away from Yu’an Palace.

206
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,599
We made the body

207
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,440
and Consort Shurong colored it.

208
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,840
It took us a while to finish.

209
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,200
Look,

210
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,719
there are characters on it.

211
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:05,679
Stop lying,

212
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,080
you troublemaker!

213
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Can you even read

214
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,359
the characters of Dazheng?

215
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,799
I can’t

216
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,039
but I know

217
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,359
what they say.

218
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,760
“Flowered forehead is from last night.

219
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,159
Behind the screen window
she smiles brightly.

220
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,679
We first met when peonies bloomed.

221
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,440
Yet we had to part too soon.”

222
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,280
Is that correct, Your Majesty?

223
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,400
I’m sure it’s your kite.

224
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,320
I found it by accident.

225
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,679
That poem is well-written.

226
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,159
I wish I could’ve read it before.

227
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,119
And?

228
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,880
What’s the other half?

229
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,520
I know too little

230
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,119
to finish it.

231
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,039
You don’t have it?

232
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,919
Or are you keeping it from me?

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
If you are,

234
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,799
I incline to think

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
your maid lied to me.

236
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,599
That’s a serious offense.

237
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,559
The other half is,

238
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,159
“I could share my feelings with no one.

239
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,159
The moon and flowers
are my only company.”

240
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,159
“With...

241
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,799
With no one.”

242
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,038
(Flowered forehead is from last night.)
(Behind the screen window she smiles brightly.)

243
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,280
(We first met when peonies bloomed.
Yet we had to part too soon.)

244
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,919
Spot on!

245
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
It’s a genius idea

246
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,119
to have your kite

247
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,960
find its way to me.

248
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,359
I’ll take it.

249
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,719
I haven’t seen you for a while.

250
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
Maybe

251
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,400
I’ll summon you to Jincheng Palace

252
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,039
when I need someone to grind the ink.

253
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,440
Your Majesty...

254
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,559
Your...

255
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,200
How’s Mr. Fang doing today?

256
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,599
The panacea worked.

257
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,359
I heard he’s recovering

258
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,719
after taking it.

259
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,840
That’s great!

260
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,039
God bless him!

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,559
It’s worth it

262
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,200
as long as he can recover.

263
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,119
Mr. Fang!

264
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,159
What are you doing here, Mr. Fang?

265
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,479
Staying indoors all day

266
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
is boring.

267
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,760
I came out

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
for a walk.

269
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,359
Thank you

270
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,799
for taking care of me these days.

271
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,919
I’ll repay you

272
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,479
for that.

273
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,119
You’ve saved me more than once.

274
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,520
That’s the least I should do.

275
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,760
Without you,

276
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:46,799
the Jiamanese

277
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,719
wouldn’t have survived this long,

278
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,000
let alone have driven out
Lord of Right Pudun.

279
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,599
Would you like something to eat?

280
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Are you hungry? I can get you some food.

281
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
No, thanks.

282
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,919
Those red decorations

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,559
are still over the place.

284
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,719
When you were sick in bed,

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,839
we were too worried

286
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,319
to do anything else.

287
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
Now that you’re getting better,

288
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,199
we’ll find time

289
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,800
to remove them all.

290
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,040
But not today.

291
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,520
Maybe tomorrow.

292
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,800
No rush. That can wait.

293
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,040
Have you seen my master?

294
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,599
Lord Qinghai just went out

295
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,599
to the market.

296
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
Good day.

297
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
Greetings, sir.

298
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,520
Take a look.

299
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,920
Do you have any sugar?

300
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:37,800
Basic supplies

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,239
are still lacking

302
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,079
after the chaos in the city,

303
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,839
not to mention rare goods like sugar.

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,680
I’m the only one in town

305
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
selling it.

306
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,119
Brown sugar

307
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,920
may seem rough,

308
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,560
but I assure you it’s clean.

309
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
There’s no sand at all.

310
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,400
Have a look.

311
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
It’s the best sugar

312
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,760
money can buy here.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,800
I’m sure

314
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,719
it’s of top quality.

315
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,920
You know better, sir!

316
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:58,959
I’ll take it all.

317
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,280
Sure! No problem!

318
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
All right. Thank you! Thanks a lot!

319
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,839
- It’s not...
- Let’s go.

320
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,880
See you, sir!

321
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,079
Let go.

322
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You’ve barely recovered.

323
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,599
Better put on more layers.

324
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,599
The wind

325
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,199
can give you a cold.

326
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,560
I’m good.

327
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:20,640
Liar.

328
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,599
I’m fine, Master.

329
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,239
It’s like ice.

330
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,079
How could you feel warm?

331
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I feel

332
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:38,839
your hand

333
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,359
is colder than mine,

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,280
but holding it

335
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,119
makes me feel warm inside.

336
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,400
Nonsense!

337
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,239
Master,

338
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,640
would you like some sugar?

339
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,280
Pass.

340
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,119
This brown sugar you bought

341
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
is even better

342
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,439
than osmanthus sugar.

343
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,680
It’s so sweet that it overpowers

344
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
my bitter medicine this morning.

345
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,959
Taste it, Master.

346
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
It’s windy. Come.

347
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,599
Gentlemen,

348
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,920
may I offer you some clothes?

349
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,959
My fur coats

350
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,479
are the best in the city.

351
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,839
Good choice!

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,839
That one is made of the fur

353
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,319
of snow fox on Red Plain.

354
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,239
Is this for me?

355
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:44,880
It’s windy.

356
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,599
What do you think?

357
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,599
It looks thick enough.

358
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,199
What’s so funny?

359
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,000
I’m too slow to realize

360
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,640
that someone

361
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:03,119
isn’t as smart

362
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,239
as he seems.

363
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,239
I’ll take it.

364
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,040
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

365
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,359
Have a nice day.

366
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,319
Thank you, sir.

367
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,800
You’re welcome.

368
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,640
That’s mine! Give it to me!

369
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,000
I will if you can catch me!

370
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
Are you going to follow me around

371
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,400
all day?

372
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,040
Why ask?

373
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,839
I have something for you, too.

374
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,719
What is it?

375
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,119
I can’t tell you now.

376
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,500
(Happiness)

377
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,520
Master.

378
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
Are those candles

379
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,079
for me?

380
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,199
You were

381
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,560
working all day

382
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,000
in the dim light.

383
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,160
These candles

384
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,839
will make your eyes comfortable.

385
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,000
Don’t you know red candles

386
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,239
are only for one occasion?

387
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:08,920

Did you just come back?

414
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:10,319
Yes.

415
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,839
Su Ming got ahead of us

416
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,160
and headed to the Left Tribe
in Hanbei through the Lax Sea.

417
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,119
I failed to

418
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,680
intercept him halfway.

419
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,599
Please punish me.

420
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,359
That’s fine.

421
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,599
Don’t blame yourself.

422
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,319
Su Ming is cunning and scheming.

423
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,479
He blocked the information

424
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,560
when the Left Tribe of Huku

425
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,680
raided Well Town.

426
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,760
And now,

427
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,959
he’s rushing to their territory.

428
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
They must’ve been in cahoots
since long ago.

429
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,319
It’s too risky for Young Master Zhuoying

430
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,359
to go to Hanbei alone.

431
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,599
Also,

432
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
I’ve got news from the capital.

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,719
About what?

434
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,760
Su Ming’s men

435
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,959
failed to

436
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:45,839
snatch the spy away

437
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,400
and poisoned themselves

438
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,239
before making Fabric Office

439
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,599
the scapegoat.

440
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,560
Manager Ju

441
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,599
died of poisoning

442
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,959
along with all members there

443
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,599
except for one embroiderer
who is in critical condition

444
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,479
and under treatment day and night.

445
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,520
She may or may not survive.

446
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,439
What?

447
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,280
Lord...

448
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,239
Don’t say a word to Haishi.

449
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,400
Lord,

450
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,160
an envoy came from Huangquan Pass

451
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
with His Majesty’s edict,

452
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:13,640
waiting for you at the main hall

453
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,880
of the Governor’s Mansion.

454
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Lord Qinghai.

455
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,359
Mr. Fu.

456
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,040
This is His Majesty’s secret edict.

457
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,959
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

458
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,240
(Come back immediately. Xu)

459
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,839
The wind is too strong.

460
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,199
Don’t stand at the window for too long.

461
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,199
I’ve heard about the bloodbath.

462
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,000
Are you going back?

463
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
It’s His Majesty’s order.

464
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,880
Manager Ju had a tough life.

465
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,359
She died a horrible death.

466
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,479
Could you burn incense for me

467
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,119
when you get back?

468
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,199
Sure.

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,760
I’m sorry for your loss.

470
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
I’m ordered to leave immediately.

471
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:11,959
And I’ve asked

472
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,000
the Governor and Zhang Chengqian

473
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,920
to look after you.

474
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,119
Don’t worry about me, Master.

475
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,760
I’m fully capable of

476
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,839
taking care of myself.

477
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,599
When we meet again,

478
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,439
I’ll be

479
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,599
as good as new.

480
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,680
We won’t be able to see each other

481
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,119
in a long while

482
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,239
after I leave.

483
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,119
I can live with that.

484
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,160
For what it’s worth,

485
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,040
I know we’re only one step away.

486
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,760
One step?

487
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,119
Yes. One step.

488
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,439
Emotionally speaking.

489
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,599
I was

490
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,439
afraid of you.

491
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,239
I didn’t want to upset you

492
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,040
or disappoint you,

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,479
so

494
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,920
I was scared

495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
to take that step.

496
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,760
But now, I’m different.

497
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,319
I’m no longer scared.

498
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,359
However far

499
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,560
you’re away,

500
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I’ll find you.

501
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:19,959
Lord,

502
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,520
we’re ready to leave.

503
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,319
Let’s go!

504
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:38,760
(Lanzi)

505
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Mr. Zhang.

506
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,880
Lord asked me

507
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,239
to take care of you.

508
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:20,439
Thanks.

509
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,119
He should be

510
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,760
back in the capital by now.

511
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
We’d better

512
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
leave and return to Huangquan Battalion

513
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:29,920
as quickly as possible.

514
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,280
It’s too soon.

515
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,560
You’re still too weak

516
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,079
to travel that far.

517
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,479
I suggest you rest for a few more days

518
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,359
in Lanzi

519
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,880
before going back.

520
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,359
Mr. Zhang,

521
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,400
it’s not my condition

522
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,280
but the condition back home

523
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,599
that concerns you, right?

524
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,160
Nothing can get past you, Mr. Fang.

525
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,319
What’s the status there?

526
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,599
After that spy Song Dian

527
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,839
lured you to Mount East Piluo

528
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,800
on your way to

529
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,079
tracking down those people of Huku,

530
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,479
Lord discovered

531
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,719
moles among us.

532
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,479
Then he rushed over,

533
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,719
which reached

534
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,040
Lord of Right Pudun’s ears instantly.

535
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,359
Given the speed,

536
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,199
that message must’ve gone out

537
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,239
from Huangquan Battalion.

538
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Meaning

539
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,079
Su Ming’s men

540
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,599
are still there.

541
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,119
That’s what Lord thinks, too.

542
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,920
The only one

543
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,839
dumb enough

544
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,520
to go to such great lengths

545
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,560
to kill Master

546
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
can be none other but Su Ming.

547
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,079
Now that he’s defected,

548
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:29,959
his men inside

549
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,280
are lying low.

550
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,800
Mr. Zhang,

551
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,479
those moles

552
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,680
aren’t as important as
Huangquan Battalion’s stability.

553
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,079
Under this circumstance,

554
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,599
only if the border is secure

555
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,520
will Master

556
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:42,760
be able to focus on traitors.

557
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,199
The longer we’re away,

558
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,680
the riskier things get.

559
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,920
We should go back

560
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,160
right away.

561
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,119
Sure.

562
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,680
I’ll have them get prepared.

563
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,600
(Lanzi)

564
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,119
Lord,

565
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,439
did you leave anything behind?

566
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,280
General!

567
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,479
(Wu Qi and everyone else are gone.)

568
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,640
Wu Qi and everyone else

569
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,920
are gone.

570
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,479
They were homeless

571
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,079
before you took them in.

572
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,239
It was their honor

573
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:02,640
to die for you.

574
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,239
Ju Qiqi’s death

575
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,160
is far from enough!

576
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,160
How far are we

577
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,319
from the Left Tribe of Huku?

578
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:10,040
A little over 15 kilometers.

579
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,119
I’ve sent them a message

580
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,400
last night.

581
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,760
Lord of Left Pudun

582
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,920
will have his men pick us up.

583
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,119
Good.

584
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,199
We’ll be able to rest

585
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,640
in a few hours.

586
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
You’re from Jifeng Pavilion.

587
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,599
Nice to meet you, General Su.

588
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,560
All these years,

589
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,640
you’ve been

590
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,599
coming at us

591
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
and targeting our members

592
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,239
one by one.

593
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,280
You must be proud of yourself.

594
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,439
Have you ever expected

595
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,359
that you’ll be the target one day?

596
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,079
General,

597
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,239
go back with me

598
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,119
or meet your death here and now.

599
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,719
Fang Jianming is fast.

600
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,359
But the thing is

601
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,959
you’re on
Lord of Left Pudun’s territory.

602
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
Do you have a shot

603
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,439
at seizing anyone on your own?

604
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,079
Kill him!

605
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,680
Go, General!

606
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,239
You are...?

607
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:32,919
General Su,

608
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,040
show your respect

609
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,159
for Lord of Left Pudun!

610
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,800
Greetings, Lord.

611
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,479
Kill him!

612
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,040
Princess Hongyao’s badge!

613
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,120
Are you Su Ming?

614
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,800
I am.

615
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,199
Do you know the man

616
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,560
after you?

617
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,879
He’s with Jifeng Pavilion.

618
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,679
Fang Jianming’s chief disciple,
Fang Zhuoying.

619
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,679
Fang Zhuoying?

620
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,479
Su Ming has gone over to the enemy

621
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:27,679
but his followers are still in the city.

622
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,280
I want you to track down all of them.

623
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,439
Detain and question

624
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
every suspect.

625
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,280
Don’t let

626
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,800
anyone get away.

627
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:39,600
Yes.

628
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,080
Is Lord Qinghai on his way back?

629
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,639
He’s been traveling

631
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,479
day and night

632
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,719
ever since your edict arrived.

633
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,120
He should be here

634
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,239
very soon.

635
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,760
Good day, Your Majesty.

636
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,280
Your Highness,

637
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,919
why bother sewing

638
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,639
the shredded fur?

639
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,239
You might prick your finger again.

640
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,479
His Majesty’s edict has arrived.

641
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,760
His Majesty’s edict is as follows:

642
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,360
His Majesty

643
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,239
hasn’t seen Consort Shurong for a while.

644
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,120
You’re summoned to Jincheng Palace.

645
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,919
Yes.

646
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,080
Your Majesty,

647
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,879
Consort Shurong has arrived.

648
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

649
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:52,879
Rise.

650
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,239
Yes.

651
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,199
Have a seat.

652
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,199
Why are you following me around?

653
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,560
I can grind the ink for you.

654
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,399
No need.

655
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,719
I’m not reviewing any reports.

656
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,479
They’re too lengthy

657
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,800
and giving me sore eyes.

658
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,360
Your kite

659
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,959
is over there.

660
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,280
I can pour you tea.

661
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,159
Don’t.

662
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
There are servants for it.

663
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,120
Read it.

664
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,840
You have a beautiful voice.

665
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,719
Read word for word.

666
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,280
I wouldn’t dare.

667
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,239
Interfering in state affairs
is a capital crime.

668
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,479
You’ve provoked me more than once.

669
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,080
I thought

670
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,159
you’re bold.

671
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,040
Why are you getting cold feet now?

672
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,159
I’ll do it.

673
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,840
Do what?

674
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,520
Read the report.

675
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,959
Oh?

676
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,399
You aren’t afraid of death?

677
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:56,399
I’m not.

678
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,719
The world is under your feet.

679
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,199
If you want someone dead,

680
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,120
even if they’re innocent,

681
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,760
you can find dirt on them

682
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,600
or cook up charges.

683
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,040
People get wronged

684
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,879
all the time.

685
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:12,280
I could be found guilty

686
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,919
whether I read the report

687
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,439
or not.

688
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,719
But I know

689
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,360
a great emperor like you

690
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,879
would never harm the innocent,

691
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,120
so I have nothing to fear.

692
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,080
By that logic,

693
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,080
if I punished you,

694
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,199
would you call me a bad emperor?

695
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,520
I wouldn’t dare.

696
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,000
You aren’t too dull.

697
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,840

698
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,760
I,

699
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:57,320
Prefect of Yuanzhong,

700
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,600
pay respect to Your Majesty...

701
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
(Tianqi)

702
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,320
(Dinghe Gate)

703
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,560
Shaozi!

704
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,000
Shaozi,

705
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,399
is it Fabric Office?

706
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,719
Are they

707
00:41:58,879 --> 00:41:59,959
all dead?

708
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,920
(Dinghe Gate)

709
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,560
Greetings, Mr. Fang.

710
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,719
Miss Zheliu can’t see.

711
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,320
I’m sorry.

712
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,439
Miss... Miss Zheliu,

713
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:20,840
I’m sorry for your loss.

714
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:24,959
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

715
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,439
The first seven days
of mourning aren’t over

716
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:32,199
and I’m still in my mourning dress.

717
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,199
It might

718
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,360
bring you bad luck.

719
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:38,239
Please excuse me.

720
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,080
(Fabric Office)

721
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,080
Aunt,

722
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:08,360
His Majesty has allowed you

723
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:10,600
to go back to Liushang.

724
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,919
I know

725
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,879
kapok was your favorite,

726
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:18,159
so I made this pattern for you.

727
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:21,080
With this cover,

728
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,479
you’ll feel less cold.

729
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,800
Rest in peace, Aunt.

730
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:40,959
I swear

731
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,560
I’ll do my best

732
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,000
to take your blind embroidery

733
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,080
even further

734
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,679
and restore Fabric Office.

735
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,479
I’ve prepared gifts

736
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,800
for your friends and family back home.

737
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:56,239
With them there,

738
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:59,560
you’ll be in good hands.

739
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,800
You’ll never

740
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,679
be forlorn again.

741
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,000
Aunt,

742
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,560
I miss you!

743
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,719
I’ll forever

744
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:31,199
remember you.

745
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,479
Aunt,

746
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:37,120
I...

747
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:40,320
I’m sorry

748
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,600
that I can’t be there with you.

749
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,040
Farewell.

750
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:52,399
May you

751
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,679
rest in peace...
