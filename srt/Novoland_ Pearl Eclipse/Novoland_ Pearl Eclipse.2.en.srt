25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,830
Haishi.

26
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,360
Look.

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,470
The kitchen

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,080
baked walnut pancakes,

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
with sesames.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,390
Everybody in Jifeng Pavilion

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,800
smelled it.

32
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,520
So no dinner?

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,520
I have 212 more shots to practice.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,270
You’re a fool to deny food.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,270
The arrows

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,030
aren’t going anywhere.

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,670
But the pancakes

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,030
are going into my belly

39
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,470
bite by bite.

40
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,960
The pancakes can’t go anywhere either.

41
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,030
I think,

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
it’s your belly

43
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,600
that’s growling.

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,440
Zhuoying!

45
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,470
Shaozi.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,270
Still practicing, Haishi?

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,830
Do you have any Spirit Lifter?

48
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,750
Give me some.

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,550
I gave you some

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,190
only a few days ago, didn’t I?

51
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,110
Shaozi.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,470
the Spirit Lifter does

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,440
give you a lift,

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,240
but don’t eat it

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,190
like it’s some kind of candy.

56
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
Alright?

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,190
You think I don’t know?

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,110
You know, days ago,

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,080
I took the new senior maid

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
to the palace.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,550
From 11:00 PM tonight
to 1:00 PM tomorrow,

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,960
we change shifts every four hours.

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,470
I’m sent to West Corner Gate.

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320
How could I slack off?

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,800
You’re so dedicated.

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,520
I wouldn’t be able to do that.

67
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,190
I’ll go get it for you.

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,910
Haishi,

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
remember to eat.

70
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,110
Come on.

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Nobody except you dare

72
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,390
climb over the palace wall to get in.

73
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,470
I couldn’t help to,

74
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,190
Shaozi.

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,830
There’s a golden rain tree

76
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,720
16 meters west of East Corner Gate.

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,110
Behind the tree is a blind spot

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,440
the guards often neglect.

79
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,830
Who wouldn’t take the short cut?

80
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,630
Be careful!

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,550
Stop!

82
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,670
I couldn’t find you anywhere

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,640
in Jifeng Pavilion.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,550
So I knew you had come here.

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,950
You should feel lucky Master isn’t here.

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,640
If he found out

87
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,070
you and I climbed over the palace wall,

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,550
there would be a reprimand.

89
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,790
I just feel so unfair.

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,070
Look at those new guards in palace.

91
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,670
None of them are better than me
in daily practice.

92
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,110
Why can they be guards

93
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,670
and I can’t?

94
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Haishi.

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,880
Master has his reason

96
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,000
to make such arrangement.

97
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,950
What we need to do

98
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,600
is to follow his orders.

99
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,550
He doesn’t allow you
to come to the palace,

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,230
so just stay at home.

101
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,790
I...

102
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,040
I just want to look around.

103
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,920
I’ll go back at dawn.

104
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,230
Without Master’s permission,

105
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,160
you can’t.

106
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on!

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
Haishi!

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
You have to obey the rules.

109
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,070
I will let you go tonight.

110
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,390
If tomorrow,

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,550
you come to the palace again

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
without Master’s permission,

113
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,000
I will tell him about it.

114
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,070
Besides,

115
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,920
you’ll do the homework for me
this month.

116
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,200
Me again?

117
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:45,950
Sure.

118
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,270
Or shall I tell Master about tonight?

119
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,350
No.

120
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,950
Let’s go.

121
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,760
Let’s take this way.

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,510
In case Master asks in a while,

123
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,110
we have to make up a story.

124
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,200
Remember it.

125
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,270
Alright.

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,790
When we see Master,

127
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,480
don’t

128
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
sell me out.

129
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,270
In a while...

130
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,920
Master.

131
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,790
Master.

132
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,640
It’s late.

133
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,440
Where have you been?

134
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,070
- On the drill ground.
- At the storyteller’s.

135
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,790
Master, the truth is

136
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,550
I was

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
practicing on the drill ground,

138
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,270
but Zhuoying

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,950
made me
go to the storyteller’s with him.

140
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
I told him

141
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,230
Master’s doctrine is that

142
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,830
to be an accomplished man,

143
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,480
one has to maintain his integrity first,

144
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,510
and then spares no efforts to learn.

145
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,110
The desire for food and pleasure

146
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,040
saps one’s will the most.

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,950
Right, Master.

148
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,270
I shouldn’t have taken

149
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Haishi out for fun at night.

150
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,510
I’ll make 200 copies of the house rules.

151
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,000
I had the kitchen make fish soup.

152
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,070
It’s in your chamber.

153
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,830
Your favorite, right?

154
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,270
I’m so happy

155
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,760
that you remember, Master.

156
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,790
Go ahead.

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes.

158
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,110
Master.

159
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,040
I should go, too.

160
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,000
It’s late.

161
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,510
Boring.

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,350
Your Majesty.

163
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,110
Judging by the time,

164
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,720
water from Shuixin Palace’s hot spring

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
may have been delivered
to the palace.

166
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,390
It is quite cold.

167
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,270
Would you like a hot spring bath?

168
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,390
A bath in daytime is untimely.

169
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,320
It’s cold indeed.

170
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,440
I presume the cold

171
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,480
has paralyzed your mind.

172
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,510
Why not warm it up

173
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,550
in the hot spring yourself?

174
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh... My mind

175
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,830
isn’t that important.

176
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
It doesn’t deserve

177
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,950
the hot spring water
from Shuixin Palace.

178
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
If it’s not Your Majesty’s intention

179
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,040
to take a hot bath,

180
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,550
how about this?

181
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,550
It’ll be the Lantern Festival
in a few days.

182
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,320
Shall I tell the servants

183
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,230
to get prepared?

184
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
So Your Majesty can make
colorful lanterns

185
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,760
for riddle games.

186
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,320
We can also build a lantern tower.

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,710
What do you say, Your Majesty?

188
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,030
The Lantern Festival.

189
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,350
I grew up in the palace.

190
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,790
All my brothers and sisters married
to a person they didn’t know.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,230
It’s not their choice.

192
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,030
Such being the case,

193
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,470
there’s no reason I should worry.

194
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,840
You ought to worry

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
about yourself.

196
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,280
If you lose the bet,

197
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,710
my homework this month

198
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,350
will be your responsibility.

199
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
You’ll be the one who loses.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,520
With Princess of Zhunian’s presence

201
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,080
at the lantern fair in question,

202
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,150
even if she comes,

203
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,350
it’ll be like finding a needle

204
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,080
in the haystack to find her.

205
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,520
What’s more,

206
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,520
it’s a rare chance

207
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,230
that only exists in stories.

208
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,350
You look just like

209
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,910
a coarse martial man,

210
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,790
without the slightest quality
of a gentleman.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,910
The chance is even rarer.

212
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,110
Let’s see.

213
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,520
Skincare.

214
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,760
Pervert!

215
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,790
How dare you offend her ladyship?

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Do you know

217
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,230
who the lady in front of you

218
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,230
is?

219
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,470
I know you.

220
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,710
You’re Zizan of Zhunian.

221
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,000
How rude!

222
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,670
I’m Zhongxu.

223
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,910
ZHONG means the second

224
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,000
and XU is the morning sun.

225
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,960
You’re from Zhunian

226
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,910
and know little

227
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,760
about Dazheng’s characters.

228
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,230
It doesn’t matter.

229
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,470
There are so many of them.

230
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
I can teach you in the future.

231
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,230
Master.

232
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,960
I brought some ginseng soup

233
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,150
from the kitchen

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,520
to refresh your mind.

235
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,200
Put it there.

236
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,710
It’s bustling on the streets, right?

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,150
You don’t have to stay here.

238
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Go with Zhuoying

239
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
to the fair in a while.

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,880
If you don’t go,

241
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,230
I don’t go, either.

242
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
I’ll go to the kitchen

243
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,030
and cook some Yuanxiao for you.

244
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,350
It’s the tradition to eat

245
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,520
sesame stuffing Yuanxiao at the start
of the new year,

246
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,590
so everything will go well in the year.

247
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,470
Commander.

248
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,880
Come in.

249
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,840
Master.

250
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,350
New task?

251
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,470
Sort of.

252
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,080
It must be the man in the palace

253
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,640
who insists to go out.

254
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,760
It’s said the liegemen can choose

255
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,910
to or not to serve a monarch.

256
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,230
A monarch should devote his life

257
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,590
and spare not a day to rest.

258
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,520
In his case,

259
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,400
it’s the other way around.

260
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,440
How dare you?

261
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,320
Is this something

262
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,880
you can comment?

263
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,470
Get out now.

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
Yes, Master.

265
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,000
What is it?

266
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,520
Commander,

267
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,150
His Majesty has ordered

268
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,710
not to deploy any troops.

269
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,110
Why did you ask us

270
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,590
to follow secretly?

271
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,150
If His Majesty doesn’t appreciate it,

272
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,470
I’m worried about your friendship.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,200
His Majesty is the ruler of Dazheng,

274
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
the heir of emperors.

275
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,440
If it were you,

276
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
would you choose friendship

277
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,590
or your duty?

278
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,000
I see.

279
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,760
I’ve searched

280
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
the streets of Tianqi City

281
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,350
and deployed sentries.

282
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,470
But the lantern fair is crowded.

283
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
In case I miss something,

284
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,150
I want to ask your order

285
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,790
if we should follow you in secret.

286
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
I’ll be with His Majesty.

287
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,110
We’ll be fine in a short time.

288
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,640
You can follow us.

289
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
But don’t get too close,

290
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
in case His Majesty

291
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,440
finds out.

292
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,550
Understood.

293
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,400
I should get going.

294
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,030
Come and look! There’s

295
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,760
the one and only skincare product.

296
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,790
Take a look, ladies.

297
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,910
It’s me, Zhuoying.

298
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,000
Way to go, buddy.

299
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
Aren’t you reading in the study?

300
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,280
What are you doing out here?

301
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
I changed my mind.

302
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Nosy man.

303
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,080
I have to be.

304
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Do you know?

305
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,710
The Lantern Festival

306
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,670
isn’t just celebrated
for lantern purposes.

307
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,640
Today,

308
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,200
lots of unmarried girls

309
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,910
go out

310
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,880
to date men.

311
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,150
What’s more,

312
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,030
a girl and a man

313
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,790
can exchange tokens of love.

314
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,790
Everyone

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,080
comes for the riddles in lanterns.

316
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,910
I have to keep an eye on you.

317
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,200
You’re afraid I’ll be cheated?

318
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,280
No, I’m afraid you’ll cheat somebody.

319
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,550
Fang Zhuoying,

320
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,590
if I’m right,

321
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,550
you’re on duty today.

322
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,590
Well, Shaozi

323
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,080
asked me to stand guard
at Huixian Restaurant.

324
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,200
On the top floor of the restaurant,

325
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,280
I can only see the crowds

326
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,230
jostling one another,

327
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,200
but nothing else.

328
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,230
So I came out.

329
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,440
You think I want

330
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,350
to come to you?

331
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,350
If your buddy here has a...

332
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,550
Mister,

333
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,280
look how exquisite it is.

334
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,910
I’ll buy a pair,

335
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,670
so we both can have one.

336
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,030
Good eye, Miss.

337
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,960
The jade pendants

338
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,640
are made of one piece of gem,

339
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,030
which stands for union

340
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,670
and being forever together.

341
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,840
They’re the best gifts

342
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,230
for your beloved.

343
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,790
I’ll take them.

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Great!

345
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
2,000 coins.

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,790
They’re beautiful.

347
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,470
Here.

348
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,960
For you.

349
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,880
No, thanks.

350
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,880
You’ve been watching it.

351
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,910
It’s for lovers.

352
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,790
I know.

353
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,000
Why did you buy it then?

354
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,470
There are too many bachelors

355
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,670
in Jifeng Pavilion.

356
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,760
Take me as an example.

357
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,520
And you.

358
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,760
And Master, too.

359
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,840
We need to buy

360
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,110
these love charms.

361
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,840
Or Jifeng Pavilion

362
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,280
should be renamed Bachelors’ Hall.

363
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,520
I don’t know whom I can gift.

364
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,550
Well, give it to Master then.

365
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,400
Take a look over here!

366
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,900
Favorable price!

367
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,200
You can gift him it.

368
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
It is His Majesty.

369
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,030
The man by his side

370
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,400
must be Fang Jianming.

371
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,840
Pass the word.

372
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,840
Tell everybody to gather here.

373
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,350
Yes.

374
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,230
It’s a tradition in Dazheng

375
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,430
that on Lantern Festival,

376
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
everybody eats Yuanxiao.

377
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,230
Why?

378
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,430
By delighting your mouth with sweetness,

379
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,400
you’ll be safe

380
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,230
and make a fortune

381
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,350
in the coming year.

382
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,280
Is it true?

383
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,950
Let me get one for you.

384
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,350
Here.

385
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,680
I can eat it on my own.

386
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,470
Have one.

387
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,190
What’s the stuffing?

388
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,000
Taro.

389
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,310
Taro! That’s great.

390
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,560
What’s great about it?

391
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,920
Look,

392
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,710
taro and Yuanxiao

393
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,520
are both round.

394
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,040
The two together

395
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,710
double the good omen.

396
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,310
We’re in a troubled time.

397
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,830
I hope this year...

398
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,640
No.

399
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,950
I hope in the rest of our lives,

400
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,190
we can live

401
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,560
happily and peacefully

402
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,830
like the omen Yuanxiao bears.

403
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,520
Here’s one for you.

404
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,640
Delicious!

405
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,190
I’m hungry.

406
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,110
Sir, if you want to eat Yuanxiao,

407
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,040
you can...

408
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,710
So,

409
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,430
you also want to control my life?

410
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,160
Sir,

411
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,950
two bowls of Yuanxiao.

412
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,830
Sure!

413
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,280
Too many eyes here.

414
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,070
Please put the mask on, sir.

415
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,400
How can I eat with that on?

416
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
Take yours off.

417
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,400
Your Yuanxiao!

418
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,950
Please enjoy.

419
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,760
I humbly ask you to eat faster.

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,640
So we can leave here.

421
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,760
Su Ming reported

422
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,310
that the rebels had been eradicated.

423
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,070
Are you still worried
about Prince Yi’s followers?

424
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,640
I’m not afraid.

425
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,950
To fish big, you need a big bait.

426
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,710
Don’t you want

427
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,070
my help to be a sure winner?

428
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,350
Haishi, look.

429
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,920
Fireworks.

430
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,830
Check the dried fruits. Look.

431
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,760
Have a piece.

432
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,830
I want some of this.

433
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Pack some for me.

434
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,470
Sure.

435
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,040
Who has he offended

436
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,070
that incurs assassination

437
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,950
on Lantern Festival?

438
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,880
My life

439
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,110
is more precious.

440
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,560
Yet the target isn’t me.

441
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,040
Haishi!

442
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,950
Why did you come over?

443
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,400
You should have protected yourself
and His Majesty.

444
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,190
I don’t think these men’s target

445
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,000
is His Majesty.

446
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,710
Enough.

447
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,070
Interesting.

448
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,560
Protect His Majesty.

449
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,430
Let’s go.

450
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,950
Take Haishi back.

451
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,520
Master.

452
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,310
Master wants you to go back.

453
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,830
Is he also

454
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,920
with the Jifeng Pavilion?

455
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,710
Your Majesty,

456
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
that’s Fang Haishi,

457
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,520
the Commander’s youngest disciple.

458
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,950
He’s quite interesting.

459
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,070
Your Majesty.

460
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
Fang Haishi is young

461
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,400
and ignorant.

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,830
Please forgive him for the offense.

463
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,800
Such a beautiful night

464
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,350
ends up in a commotion.

465
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,160
Fang Jianming

466
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,680
is such a spoiler, isn’t he?

467
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,430
Your target is me.

468
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,350
Your master

469
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,280
is an acquaintance of mine.

470
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,830
You don’t deserve to die.

471
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,430
But you get someone irrelevant

472
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,800
in this.

473
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,310
So you have to die.

474
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,560
Commander,

475
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,760
His Majesty has returned to the palace.

476
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,710
I’ll leave you to take care of the rest.

477
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,230
Don’t give them another chance to talk.

478
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

479
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,160
Don’t get mad, General.

480
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,590
Those suicide squads

481
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,160
have been loyal to you

482
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,920
since the Rebellion of Prince Yi.

483
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,160
They’re determined

484
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,880
to devote everything to you.

485
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,920
Moreover,

486
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,710
that’s not all of them.

487
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
There are more

488
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,920
to serve your cause.

489
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,920
You fool.

490
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,190
Do you know why

491
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,040
he killed all those men?

492
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,710
Because he wants

493
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
not a word to go out.

494
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,310
Perhaps,

495
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,230
he has figured out

496
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,880
I’m behind this assassination.

497
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,400
General.

498
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I guess

499
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,230
he wants to keep it quiet

500
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,800
and from His Majesty too.

501
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,920
General,

502
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,070
if he slanders you to His Majesty,

503
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,830
your loyalty

504
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,310
will be questioned.

505
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,680
There were six Wing Generals

506
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,470
fighting with His Majesty
against rebels.

507
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,680
I’m the last one serving in court now.

508
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,230
In terms of my loyalty

509
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,280
and the trust His Majesty places in me,

510
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,040
I’m second to none.

511
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
Fang Jianming grew up

512
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,880
with His Majesty,

513
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,520
otherwise he might also

514
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
be dead right now.

515
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,560
Pass my word.

516
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,950
Tell everyone

517
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,760
to be discreet.

518
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,160
Yes.

519
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,040
Master,

520
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,310
- I...
- What are you doing?

521
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,070
Quiet.

522
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,880
Master is waiting for the medicines.

523
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,310
Take them in.

524
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,680
I dare not.

525
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,560
You dare not?

526
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,640
You don’t know.

527
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,310
The Yuanxiao stall

528
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,680
is right down Huixian Restaurant.

529
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,040
If I were there,

530
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,710
I should have gone to help first time.

531
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,830
Gladly you were there.

532
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,830
Otherwise,

533
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,640
I’d be so doomed.

534
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,000
Fang Zhuoying, my buddy,

535
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,640
you had guts to slack off

536
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,310
but no guts to face Master.

537
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,310
Give the tray to me. I’ll take it in.

538
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
On one condition though,

539
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,880
forget about me
climbing over palace wall.

540
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,230
We’re even now.

541
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,920
Alright, just go.

542
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,590
Master.

543
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,070
You lost so much blood.

544
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,040
Master, if you’re not wounded,

545
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,950
I’d better leave you.

546
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,590
Put it down.

547
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,190
Yes.

548
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,760
What’s wrong with you?

549
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,520
It’s... It’s nothing, Master.

550
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,470
I should go.

551
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,160
Master, look,

552
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,310
it’s still me

553
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,040
with you to the lantern fair this year.

554
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,800
The two pendants

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,350
are made of one piece of jade.

556
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,920
It symbolizes being forever together

557
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,070
and never being apart.

558
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,830
Both of us take one.

559
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,710
It’s a love charm.

560
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,230
I’ll be with you

561
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,920
on every lantern fair yet to come.

562
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,830
I’ll go copy sutras now.

563
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,830
100 copies.

564
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,560
No, 200.

565
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,880
I’m going now.

566
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,310
Haishi, come here.

567
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,160
Master.

568
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,310
Morning, Master.

569
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
Why are you preparing the breakfast?

570
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,710
Where is Haishi?

571
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,880
He said he’d skip breakfast.

572
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,640
He locks himself

573
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,350
in the study

574
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,680
with the scrolls in the morning.

575
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,110
He has to eat.

576
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,110
Go fetch him.

577
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,880
Yes.

578
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,680
Don’t bother.

579
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,830
Let’s eat without him.

580
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,110
Your Majesty.

581
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,830
It’s time to get up.

582
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,560
It’s rest day.

583
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,110
No morning assembly.

584
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,640
Am I required to consult you

585
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,640
about when to get up,

586
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,520
when to eat,

587
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,760
and when to see a consort?

588
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
Forgive me!

589
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,040
I would never meddle in these things.

590
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,110
The heaven and the sun are the witnesses

591
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,280
of my loyalty to Your Majesty.

592
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,350
Alright.

593
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,350
Stop this show.

594
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
What is it you want to report?

595
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,070
Report from Zhunian Tribe

596
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,470
will soon arrive

597
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,000
on expedited delivery.

598
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,760
Boring.

599
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,430
Master.

600
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,880
Why are you so elusive?

601
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,950
You’re blushing.

602
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,830
Did you catch a cold?

603
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,950
No, no, no.

604
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,070
Good then.

605
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,280
If you’re ill,

606
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,310
don’t wait any longer
to see a physician.

607
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,230
I wish there could be a cure for this.

608
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
Master,

609
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
I should go practice.

610
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,950
I went to the lantern fair for fun
last night.

611
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,640
I’ll make up for the practice.

612
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

613
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,400
Rise.

614
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

615
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,880
What does Zhunian want this time?

616
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,760
Skip the details.

617
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,000
I know what they want

618
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,040
is either money or grain,

619
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,680
or trade, or title.

620
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,160
Your Majesty,

621
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,710
it’s a merry thing this time.

622
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,760
A merry thing?

623
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,950
In so many years

624
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,560
since we established diplomatic tie,

625
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,590
when did they ever

626
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,040
report a merry thing?

627
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,830
If it’s not for the sake

628
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,430
of Jichang who is in Zhunian
as a hostage,

629
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,430
I wouldn’t even care

630
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,160
if they’d die or not.

631
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,800
It is a merry thing
about Prince Jichang.

632
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,680
His Highness appealed
to the King of Zhunian

633
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,350
to return to Dazheng.

634
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,310
The King of Zhunian has approved.

635
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,470
Jichang is coming back?

636
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,880
Yes.

637
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,560
It’s been more than a decade

638
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,880
since he went to Zhunian, right?

639
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,430
That’s great.

640
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,910
That’s great news.

641
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

642
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
But there’s more.

643
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,950
Go ahead.

644
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,950
Coming back with Prince Jichang

645
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,190
will be Princess Tilan of Zhunian Tribe.

646
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,950
The King of Zhunian said

647
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,360
Dazheng and Zhunian have been bonded
by marriages.

648
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,600
He would like to marry Princess Tilan

649
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,710
to Dachang to consolidate our bond.

650
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,390
This marriage

651
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,800
will rebuild our bond.

652
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,080
Give my reply to the King of Zhunian.

653
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,230
Tell him

654
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,190
that Jichang’s return is settled.

655
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,000
As for Princess Tilan,

656
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,910
she’s not invited.

657
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,710
My harem is full.

658
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I’ve no intention of one more consort.

659
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,280
Your Majesty.

660
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
It’s a matter
concerning peace for Dazheng.

661
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,190
And Your Majesty do not have a son now.

662
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,800
My family affairs

663
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,150
are not subject to your advice.

664
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,710
Your Majesty.

665
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
Forgive me for the offense.

666
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,560
Prince Jichang is still in Zhunian.

667
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,000
If Your Majesty order

668
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,470
Princess Tilan to be sent back now,

669
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,280
Zhunian won’t dare revolt,

670
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,670
but Prince Jichang

671
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,600
would suffer from humiliation.

672
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,710
Merely a small tribe

673
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,910
intends to profit from Dazheng.

674
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,280
I don’t think their dream
will come true.

675
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,040
By the way, General Su.

676
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,080
I encountered assassins
on Lantern Festival.

677
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,630
Do you know about it?

678
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,630
Yes, I heard rumors.

679
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,230
However...

680
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,950
In your opinion,

681
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,470
who could have done that?

682
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,040
I have no idea.

683
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,470
Someone ordered the assassination,

684
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,710
but the target isn’t me.

685
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,120
I found this

686
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,800
very amusing.

687
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,910
Your Majesty is the chosen ruler.

688
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,950
I’m sure the assassins

689
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,430
were too scared of your majesty

690
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,950
to hurt you.

691
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,840
Those duds.

692
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,910
So foolish they are to try to

693
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,040
shake the foundation of Dazheng.

694
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,600
I admire your wisdom.

695
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,360
General Su,

696
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,150
please give my reply

697
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
to the King of Zhunian

698
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,870
that both appeals are granted.

699
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

700
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,470
Chief Stewardess Ju!

701
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,120
Madam Ju!

702
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,200
(Fabric Office)

703
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Merry things are coming

704
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,600
in pairs, Madam Ju.

705
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,430
Madam Ju.

706
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,360
Mr. Shi.

707
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,840
Princess Tilan of Zhunian

708
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,470
is coming to the capital.

709
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,390
By the rules,

710
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,040
Her Highness will dress

711
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,390
in Dazheng’s costumes.

712
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,230
Look,

713
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,190
I’m bringing over the materials.

714
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,910
Pick whatever you like.

715
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,840
If it’s not enough,

716
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,560
go to the Imperial Manufactories.

717
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
I’ll have more sent over

718
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,190
as soon as possible.

719
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,630
Thank you, Mr. Shi,

720
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,430
for coming over in particular.

721
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,670
Don’t mention it.

722
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,190
It is in my duty.

723
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,320
Besides,

724
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,190
The Imperial Manufactories
and Fabric Office

725
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,430
are closely connected.

726
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,950
We should work as one

727
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,190
and support each other.

728
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,390
So don’t mention it.

729
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,560
Boys.

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,230
You’re all busy.

731
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,120
And you rarely come out.

732
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,040
So I purchased materials you might need

733
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,080
on the rest day

734
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,430
for your office.

735
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,950
These are all

736
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,360
genuinely good stuff.

737
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,120
I appreciate that, Mr. Shi.

738
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,710
This isn’t worth much.

739
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,080
Merely a work by hand.

740
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,360
I hope you don’t mind.

741
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,430
Not at all.

742
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,150
Everybody knows that your brocade

743
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
is valued by gold.

744
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,710
It’s not something

745
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,760
everyone can get.

746
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,470
Thank you so much, Madam Ju.

747
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,230
Commander.

748
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,080
Madam Ju is here.

749
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,080
My lord.

750
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
There’s no Lord Qinghai now.

751
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
Who are you calling my lord?

752
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,670
Forgive me.

753
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,560
You haven’t changed at all.

754
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,190
Still so pure

755
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,230
and free of desires.

756
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
Message from our informant in Huku.

757
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,470
Lord of Left Pudun and his troops

758
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,520
are marching towards Huangquan Pass.

759
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,360
It’s already spring in Hanzhou,

760
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,000
but it snows from time to time.

761
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,190
It’s not a good time
for military actions.

762
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
They’re making little progress.

763
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,190
But I’m sure they’re plotting something.

764
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,670
Keep looking.

765
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,710
And report to me again.

766
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,800
Yes.

767
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,390
Anything else?

768
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
I heard on the Lantern Festival,

769
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,840
you and His Majesty were attacked.

770
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.

771
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,710
Why didn’t you

772
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,080
keep a man alive and question him

773
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,150
about the mastermind?

774
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,280
It’s better that those men are dead.

775
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,470
There’s another thing

776
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,670
I’d like to ask

777
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
for your permission, Commander.

778
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,120
In recent years,

779
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,840
my sight is weakening.

780
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,000
It’s becoming harder
to see things clearly.

781
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,710
I have a distant niece,

782
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,910
named Zheliu.

783
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,430
Her parents died when she was little.

784
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,080
She’s now in the capital.

785
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,870
I’m thinking of taking her
to the palace,

786
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,910
on the one hand,

787
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,000
to be united with her,

788
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,080
and on the other,

789
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,600
to test her capacities.

790
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,040
If she’s a smart girl,

791
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,950
she can take over my work.

792
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,560
What do you say, Commander?

793
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,430
You’re always so thoughtful.

794
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,390
Do whatever you want.

795
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,280
I know you like tea.

796
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,390
This is the latest
Yunding Silver Needle.

797
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,000
It’s the harvest of the first flush

798
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,390
from a decades-old tree.

799
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,280
I ordered it harvested and baked.

800
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,670
Thank you.

801
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,630
Shaozi.

802
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,560
Commander.

803
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,150
Madam Ju brought us fine tea.

804
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,870
Share it with others.

805
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, I thank you, Madam Ju

806
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,430
on behalf of everyone else.

807
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,040
You’re welcome.

808
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,150
Commander,

809
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,520
I have work to do.

810
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,950
I have to go.

811
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,710
Escort Madam Ju
back to the Fabric Office.

812
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,230
Madam Ju,

813
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
please.

814
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,600
Zhuoying,

815
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,430
tell me.

816
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,230
If someone does

817
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,560
kill the emperor,

818
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,950
what will Master do?

819
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,190
You and I both know clearly

820
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,840
about their bond.

821
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,360
If one day it happens,

822
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,390
I guess Master will

823
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,430
find the killer

824
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,800
at all costs,

825
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,710
and kill him.

826
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,280
Alright.

827
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,710
Stop thinking about that.

828
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,600
That day won’t come.

829
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,910
That’s the purpose

830
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,320
of our very existence, isn’t it?

831
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,910
Zhuoying,

832
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,910
on the Lantern Festival, the assassins’

833
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,950
target isn’t His Majesty, is it?

834
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,040
I think their target

835
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,360
is Master.

836
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,120
Does Master have any foes?

837
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,520
Our master

838
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,630
is a knife His Majesty

839
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,390
hides in the shadow.

840
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,120
No doubt he has lots of foes.

841
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,390
Even those

842
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,080
who have no grudges with him

843
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,670
want to break this knife of him

844
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,800
for fear.

845
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,710
But I don’t understand.

846
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,760
Why did Master order

847
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,080
all those assassins to be killed

848
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,470
and to spare no one’s life?

849
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,230
Doesn’t he want to know

850
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,840
who the man behind it is?

851
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
That’s beyond my knowledge.

852
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,710
If I can figure out

853
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,080
such puzzles,

854
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,560
then Jifeng Pavilion will

855
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,520
still be Master’s.

856
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,800
I’m just curious

857
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,910
about the truth behind it.

858
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,910
Dummy,

859
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,710
don’t worry about Master.

860
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,870
I thought

861
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,080
you were dating someone

862
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,080
and was so happy for you.

863
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,760
Now I realize that

864
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,630
all you think about

865
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,560
is Master.

866
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,600
How loving!

867
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,360
Will you please

868
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,840
think about your buddy here?

869
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What nonsense is that?

870
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,080
Fang Haishi! Let me go!

871
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,910
Fang Haishi!

872
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,600
Fang Zhuoying! Fang Zhuoying!

873
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,120
Fang Zhuoying!

874
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,000
You kick me?

875
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,150
And you kick my foot?

876
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,520
My foot!

877
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,000
My hair! Haishi!

878
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,710
My hair!

879
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,320
Master.

880
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,150
Master!

881
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,600
Master.

882
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,150
Your hair is entangled.

883
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,600
Just a second.

884
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,470
- Master.
- Master.

885
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,280
Master.

886
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,560
Careful with your hand.

887
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,600
Master.

888
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:01,000
Look, he started it.

889
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,840
Zhuoying,

890
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,670
come with me.

891
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,670
Yes.

892
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,430
Gently, gently.

893
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,870
Hurry.

894
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,390
Master.

895
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,840
You know clearly

896
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,360
that Haishi is younger, don’t you?

897
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,390
Yes, I do, Master.

898
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,430
Haishi is younger.

899
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,360
Otherwise,

900
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,470
I wouldn’t care about what he did.

901
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,910
On the Lantern Festival,

902
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,080
what did you and Haishi do?

903
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,280
I...

904
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,800
We subdued the assassins.

905
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,150
And before that?

906
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,280
Before....

907
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,870
Before...

908
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,040
You’re 20 years old.

909
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,040
I don’t forbid you

910
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,560
to be intimate with girls,

911
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,800
but we have our responsibilities.

912
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,000
It’s not about time.

913
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,670
Master,

914
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,520
well, I... You misunderstand.

915
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,390
Misunderstand?

916
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,040
Of course.

917
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,040
In my eyes,

918
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,520
duty always comes first.

919
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,840
I wouldn’t spare a thought for feelings.

920
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,520
Bear it in mind.

921
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,800
Haishi is your brother.

922
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,150
Do not cross the line.

923
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,360
Master.

924
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,710
I understand.

925
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,230
A senior should be the role model.

926
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,910
I ought to have poise and authority.

927
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,470
I will not lead

928
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,630
Haishi astray.

929
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,870
Mind your behaviors.

930
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,280
Master, if that’s all,

931
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,520
I should leave.

932
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,710
Go ahead.

933
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,560
Zhuoying.

934
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,280
It took you so long.

935
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,360
I...

936
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,390
Master.

937
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,760
Any instructions, Master?

938
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,280
Feeling hard to fall asleep?

939
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,430
Yes, a little bit.

940
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,000
I’ll meditate with you.

941
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Go back to your room.

942
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,080
Yes.

943
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,870
Find inner peace,

944
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,560
and maintain it.

945
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,560
Try to think,

946
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,840
but treat with indifference.

947
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,670
In the case of a delusion,

948
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,120
let it perish itself.
