25
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,225
Your Highness.

26
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:34,360
It’s getting late.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
You should go to bed now.

28
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,955
Your Highness.

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,039
It’s a sort of hard work.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,625
You’d better get some sleep.

31
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,300
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

32
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:48,600
You’re silly.

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
If you hurt your hands badly,

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
your whole life will be ruined.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,575
Don’t cry.

36
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,679
Go to get some ointment.

37
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,759
We’re in the South Palace.

38
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,839
We didn’t bring anything in.

39
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,839
Where can I find the ointment?

40
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,039
Send for a physician, then.

41
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,800
It doesn’t help by looking on.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,839
Your Highness, hang on for a while.

43
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,080
You should stop working.

44
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:07,944
Don’t worry.

45
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,210
I made the promise.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,879
I don’t want to be looked down upon.

47
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,051
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,475
What’s up?

49
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,520
I heard from the South Palace

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,199
that Consort Shurong’s hand

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,479
got hurt because of carving amulets.

52
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,250
Her wound is bleeding.

53
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,399
She is bleeding because of carving?

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
Without timely treatment,

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,600
she may become disabled.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,039
Send for a physician, then.

57
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,691
Why do you come to me?

58
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,725
Do you think I can treat her?

59
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:52,234
No, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,600
But it was your order

61
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,010
to move Consort Shurong
to the South Palace.

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,839
Without your permission,

63
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,400
well,

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,759
we dare not do anything.

65
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,479
I haven’t deposed her yet.

66
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,679
Keep to the rules.

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,350
Don’t bother me
with her business from now on.

68
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,050
Er...

69
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:10,800
Yes. Yes.

70
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:11,900
So...

71
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,720
So, I’m going

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,075
to relay your order.

73
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,250
A lowlife.

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,239
Later,

75
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,709
I’ll take you to the Palace through
West Corner Gate.

76
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,204
Keep the rules

77
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,880
of the Palace in your mind.

78
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:30,799
Yes!

79
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,725
Let’s go!

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Haishi.

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,090
Zhuoying.

82
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,760
Are you going to the Palace today?

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,720
Yes.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
Why don’t you join us?

85
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,119
I haven’t finished

86
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:49,880
the handover of my work.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
I still need a couple of days.

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,375
But today,

89
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,440
I’m going with you.

90
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:53,839
I’ve been appointed Palace Minister.

91
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,275
I need to go to the Fabric Office

92
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,480
to take my measurements.

93
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:57,720
Go with us?

94
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:58,475
Yeah.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,679
No, no, no.

96
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:02,720
It struck me

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,839
that I have something to pick up.

98
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,040
I’ll get it now.

99
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:16,880
What time is it now?

100
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,920
Half past seven.

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,239
It’s close to eight.

102
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,351
Your Majesty.

103
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,760
Jifeng Pavilion is moving to

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,659
Zhaoming Palace today.

105
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,160
After breakfast,

106
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,720
would you like to go to Zhaoming Palace?

107
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,519
When did I say

108
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,679
I would go there?

109
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:33,625
Oh.

110
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,264
So, would you like...?

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,160
Do you have

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
nothing serious to do?

113
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,260
You spend all your time reading my mind.

114
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,040
I...

115
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:49,715
Go to court.

116
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:50,865
Yes.

117
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:58,200
Mr. Fang Haishi, forgive me.

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
It’s our first time to make you clothes.

119
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
We have no records of your measurements.

120
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,359
That’s why you had

121
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,480
to come in person.

122
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,160
Don’t worry.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Jifeng Pavilion is in the Palace now.

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
If there are any changes,

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,399
I will go there

126
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,225
to measure you.

127
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,279
You needn’t

128
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,559
come again.

129
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,119
Zheliu.

130
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,000
Your pearl bracelet

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,079
is unique.

132
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,640
It doesn’t seem to be

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,799
the product of Tianqi City.

134
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,130
It looks like the jewelry of Yuezhou.

135
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,640
It’s from one of my friends.

136
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,559
I don’t know the place of its origin.

137
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,920
I think the pearls are crystal and full.

138
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
They look good.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,640
So I put it on my wrist.

140
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,264
A friend?

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,960
Miss Ju.

142
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,769
Zheliu.

143
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,720
I brought you the material

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,959
for official robes.

145
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,495
Uncle Shi,

146
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,600
Miss Ju went out
to purchase silk thread.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Shall I put

148
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
the material away first?

149
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,079
That’s good.

150
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,650
I trust you.

151
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,685
Mr. Fang, please wait a moment.

152
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,679
Is this the newly appointed

153
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:25,119
Palace Minister, Fang Haishi?

154
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,781
Mr. Fang.

155
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,239
Lord Qinghai and I

156
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,720
are good friends.

157
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,799
Strictly speaking,

158
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,839
you should call me

159
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,900
Uncle Shi.

160
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,799
Uncle Shi.

161
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,160
No wonder there’s talk

162
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,279
around the city

163
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,160
that the newly appointed Palace Minister

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,225
has a graceful bearing,

165
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,345
who is an elegant young man
in these chaotic times.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,119
You’re worthy of the name.

167
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,440
Sure enough.

168
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,799
I’m flattered.

169
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,559
You’re young and promising.

170
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,100
With the instruction of
such a great master as Lord Qinghai,

171
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,200
you’ll make rapid advances.

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,359
At that time, don’t forget to

173
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,825
give me some support.

174
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,040
You are being too modest.

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
Mr. Fang.

176
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,350
I’m worrying about something recently.

177
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,475
Since I run into you,

178
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,900
I want to discuss it with you.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,519
What is it?

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
The wedding, of course.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,640
Your master has just
recovered from illness

182
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,239
and returned to the court.

183
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,204
His Majesty announced to
all the civilian and military officers

184
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,335
that Lord Qinghai was still alive.

185
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,604
As he inherited the title and fiefdom,

186
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,679
I suppose he and Miss Ju

187
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,275
will have a wedding soon.

188
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,600
Wedding?

189
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,326
You don’t know?

190
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,479
Their marriage was contracted

191
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,440
by Lord Qinghai’s father years ago.

192
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,320
Lord Qinghai

193
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,559
literally grew up

194
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,679
with Miss Ju together.

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,139
If it weren’t for
the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

196
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,058
they would’ve been married long ago.

197
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,719
But the delay

198
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,000
is good for them.

199
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,599
His Majesty has been good
to Lord Qinghai.

200
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,075
He’ll guarantee them a decent wedding.

201
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,900
Maybe

202
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,799
he’ll preside over the ceremony.

203
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,400
You just got promoted.

204
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
Jifeng Pavilion

205
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,280
has moved into Zhaoming Palace.

206
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,571
Lord Qinghai will marry soon.

207
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,119
Three happy events

208
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,675
come one after another.

209
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,925
That’s why I’m worried.

210
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,250
What kind of gift

211
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,050
do you think I should prepare?

212
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:23,719
Mr. Fang.

213
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:27,396
Mr. Fang?

214
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,799
Mr. Fang, Uncle Shi,

215
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,325
please take some tea.

216
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,080
I have something important to do.

217
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,430
I have to go.

218
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,460
Well...

219
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:45,039
Uncle Shi, please.

220
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,125
OK.

221
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:52,039
Mr. Fang

222
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,679
looks pale.

223
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,305
Your Majesty,
is there an order to be issued?

224
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,479
You old fox.

225
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,300
You’re getting more and more cunning.

226
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,465
I dare not.

227
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:09,239
I wanted to tell you,

228
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,799
but you asked me

229
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,999
not to mention...

230
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,880
not to mention her.

231
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,575
I asked you not to mention
that woman’s name,

232
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,840
so you used “her” instead.

233
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,400
You thought it wasn’t a violation
of my order?

234
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,525
Mu Deqing.

235
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,880
Are you

236
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,840
getting tired of living?

237
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,320
It’s my fault. It’s my fault.

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,200
I...

239
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

240
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,770
Didn’t you go
to the Left General’s Mansion?

241
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I heard you’ve been

242
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,650
hanging around there recently.

243
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,559
Their stools were almost broken

244
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,840
because you sat on them for too long.

245
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,320
Jifeng Pavilion

246
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,719
has moved into Zhaoming Palace.

247
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,475
Really?

248
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,275
Yes.

249
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,475
I wanted to go and have a look.

250
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,359
But I don’t know why

251
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,640
my mind is in turmoil.

252
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,159
I’ll go another day.

253
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,835
Send the rewards to them.

254
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:54,814
Yes.

255
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:56,760
See you.

256
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,585
See you, Your Majesty.

257
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:00,159
Your Majesty.

258
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,400
Where are we going?

259
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,525
Imperial Hospital.

260
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,625
Oh.

261
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

262
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:13,320
Mu Deqing.

263
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:14,900
Ah?

264
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:18,175
Ah?

265
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:20,850
Oh.

266
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,320
His Majesty has nothing special to do.

267
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,599
He just wants to have a look

268
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,840
at the medical records

269
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,039
in case there are any mistakes.

270
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:45,440
Whose records does
His Majesty want to see?

271
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,690
Just bring all of those out.

272
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:50,880
Well,

273
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,520
stand up,

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,975
or you can’t work.

275
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

276
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,640
Is there anything wrong

277
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,919
with the medical records?

278
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:06,840
I have no idea.

279
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:07,799
Why would His Majesty

280
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,159
care about such trifles?

281
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,679
Is there any inside story?

282
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,799
Stop it.

283
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,359
I’m sweating now.

284
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,479
(Medical records)
So many records.

285
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,665
Your Majesty,

286
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,359
these are

287
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,799
records

288
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,239
of your health

289
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,171
and medicine you took
when you were ill.

290
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,651
You rarely got ill.

291
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,159
So the records are much less

292
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,359
than those

293
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,244
of the former emperors.

294
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,216
Do all of these belong to me?

295
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,499
We also have concubines’ records.

296
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,600
Would you like to see

297
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,224
any of that?

298
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:25,400
Rabbit’s life matters.

299
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,520
If there’s anything wrong,

300
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,550
when Consort Shurong is back,

301
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,960
how can we explain it?

302
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,719
We don’t treat rabbits.

303
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,760
Please leave.

304
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,919
I’m begging you, sir.

305
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,875
Please help me.

306
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,479
It’s not that I don’t want to help.

307
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,679
I just act

308
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,679
according to the rules.

309
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,840
Besides, His Majesty

310
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,725
- is in there.
- Dr. Li.

311
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,550
- Well...
- We can’t afford

312
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,975
- to disturb His Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

313
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,400
I’m going to drive them away

314
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,000
lest they disturb you.

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,159
Bring them in.

316
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,650
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

317
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,285
What’s with the noise?

318
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,760
Your Majesty.

319
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,039
Consort Shurong’s rabbit

320
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,080
is not well recently.

321
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,280
It has diarrhea.

322
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,960
I come to see if the physicians

323
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,175
can treat Xiaoguai…

324
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,700
can treat the rabbit.

325
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:29,706
Bring it up.

326
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,550
Here. Your Majesty.

327
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,599
Look.

328
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,379
It looks sickly.

329
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,075
What were you doing

330
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,200
in Yu’an Palace?

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
Without the master,

332
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,320
can’t all the idle people

333
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,875
take care of a rabbit?

334
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Xiaoguai is always

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,520
close to Consort Shurong.

336
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,075
After she moved to South Palace,

337
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,376
it became ill.

338
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:04,919
These days it wouldn’t eat hay.

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We cut radish for it

340
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,479
and it...

341
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,400
Enough, enough.

342
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,719
Stop.

343
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,239
Don’t bother His Majesty

344
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,719
with such trifles.

345
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,760
Honestly!

346
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,980
Mu Deqing.

347
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:15,775
Yes?

348
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,400
You keep the rabbit.

349
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,260
Ah?

350
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:18,960
Why?

351
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,840
I...

352
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,239
I keep and support you.

353
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,475
Can’t you

354
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
keep a rabbit for me?

355
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,080
Sure. Sure.

356
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,250
I’ll keep it, Your Majesty.

357
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,559
Dr. Li.

358
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:33,640
Yes.

359
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,599
There are too many records.

360
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:37,765
I won’t look at each of these.

361
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:41,239
Will you tell me about

362
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,919
the records of yesterday?

363
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,039
Your Majesty.

364
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,450
There was only one record yesterday.

365
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,650
Consort Shurong’s hand

366
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,760
was injured because of carving.

367
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,950
We wrote a prescription for her

368
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,950
and asked her to have a good rest.

369
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,050
But...

370
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,559
But what?

371
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,775
She didn’t listen to us.

372
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,760
She just applied some ointment

373
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,175
and dressed the wound

374
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,075
before she continued to carve.

375
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,479
Unreasonable.

376
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,559
Fine.

377
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,275
It’s none of your business.

378
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,840
You can’t persuade a person
who deserves to die.

379
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,335
She insists on

380
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,925
achieving her aim.

381
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
You just do your job.

382
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,520
It’s good if you can cure her.

383
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,039
It doesn’t matter if you can’t.

384
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
Good day, Your Majesty.

386
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,040
It’s raining so hard.

387
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,640
Why do you stay here?

388
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,700
I went to Fabric Office
to take my measurements

389
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,065
and was held up.

390
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,100
Don’t neglect your health

391
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,821
just because you’re young.

392
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,680
It may turn into a cause of disease
when you get old.

393
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,376
Master, you talk like an old man.

394
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,959
How many years are you senior to us?

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,160
Many years.

396
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:52,839
I’m an elder to you.

397
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:54,715
Master.

398
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,520
I’ve counted.

399
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,710
You’re not much older than us.

400
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:00,355
Have you counted?

401
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,476
Yes.

402
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,129
I’ve counted carefully.

403
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,160
Being several years older made
a big difference when we were young,

404
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,716
while it doesn’t

405
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,661
as we get older.

406
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,400
Drink it.

407
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,199
It will warm you up.

408
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,426
In fact,

409
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,200
Zhuoying and I

410
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,950
have dragged you down these years.

411
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,884
What do you mean?

412
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,669
If it weren’t for taking care of us,

413
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,615
you would’ve been married long ago.

414
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,786
You may have

415
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,100
many children now.

416
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
What happened to you?

417
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,410
Master, I need to leave

418
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:30,760
before

419
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,959
the palace gate

420
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,118
is locked.

421
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,840
Then stay.

422
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,520
I’ll have them

423
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,880
get you new clothes.

424
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,199
Master.

425
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:04,479
Go to make

426
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,719
some hot herb tea for Haishi.

427
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,439
And

428
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,625
find some clothes for him.

429
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,079
Is Haishi back?

430
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:09,700
Go ahead.

431
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,079
Yes.

432
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,719
Haishi.

433
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,920
Master said you got wet in the rain.

434
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,839
He specially asked me
to send you hot herb tea.

435
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,920
I’m coming in.

436
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,479
Haishi?

437
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,239
Haishi?

438
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,520
(Jifeng Pavilion)

439
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,075
Haishi.

440
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,680
You went to Zhaoming Palace last night.

441
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,359
Master asked me
to make you herb tea,

442
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,119
but I didn’t see you afterwards.

443
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,119
I’m off duty this morning,

444
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,079
so I come here to look for you.

445
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,250
You’re here as I expected.

446
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,160
I had some business last night.

447
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,839
It rained heavily.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,359
Didn’t Master ask you to stay?

449
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:37,675
He did.

450
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,100
Master is always kind to me.

451
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,439
Haishi.

452
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:47,400
I think

453
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,959
you’ve been preoccupied lately.

454
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,920
You seem to grow up overnight.

455
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,359
I don’t even know

456
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,719
what’s on your mind.

457
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,239
It’s good that

458
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,000
His Majesty offered you a position.

459
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,175
You’ll become steady.

460
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:09,950
Here.

461
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,119
Look.

462
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,439
Your favorite food.

463
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,325
Take it.

464
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,160
Have you been to Fabric Office again?

465
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,560
How can I spare the time?

466
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,520
I bought it at the market.

467
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
Thank you, Zhuoying.

468
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
I’m not hungry. You keep it.

469
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,975
Have you done your errands?

470
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,560
I almost forgot
if you hadn’t referred to it.

471
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,079
I have a lot of things to do
in the Palace.

472
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,920
I have to go.

473
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,959
Zhuoying.

474
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:45,975
I’m going with you.

475
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,775
Master isn’t in the Palace.

476
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,410
He is at the Left General’s Mansion.

477
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,745
I’m not going to see him.

478
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,889
I’m going to see His Majesty.

479
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,216
His Majesty?

480
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,041
Don’t worry.

481
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,959
I don’t have the guts

482
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
to assassinate him openly and wantonly.

483
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:18,764
I took third
in the Imperial Examination,

484
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,675
yet I didn’t get the chance
to see His Majesty.

485
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,479
Now it’s time to meet him.

486
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,880
Your Majesty, are you thirsty?

487
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,839
Shall I ask them to bring you

488
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,125
a cup of walnut pine nut tea?

489
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,140
How’s the rabbit?

490
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,959
Your Majesty,

491
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,959
thanks to Dr. Li

492
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,250
for giving it herbal tea
and acupuncture treatment.

493
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,091
Xiaoguai is well now.

494
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,760
It’s full of spirits.

495
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,385
Come here.

496
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,075
Yes.

497
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,170
Get closer.

498
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,770
Oh.

499
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,199
Your Majesty.

500
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,040
Out.

501
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,319
Yes. I’m getting out now.

502
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:18,920
Your Majesty.

503
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,079
Fang Haishi, the newly appointed
Palace Minister, asked to see you.

504
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,479
Let him in.

505
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,680
Yes.

506
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,520
Your Majesty.

507
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,350
Shall I get out?

508
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,400
No.

509
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,560
Stay here.

510
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,200
Let Fang Haishi

511
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,239
have a look.

512
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,119
Yes.

513
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,165
Greetings, Your Majesty.

514
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,400
Rise.

515
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,386
Thank you, Your Majesty.

516
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,886
You look fresh with energy today.

517
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,450
Mr. Fang,

518
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,280
do you still like killing now?

519
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,550
I dare not.

520
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,600
Your Majesty, please don’t
make fun of me.

521
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,760
The pearl tax corruption
has been eliminated now.

522
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,280
I didn’t understand Your Majesty before.

523
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,920
Not to mention
your political and military achievements

524
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,959
are comparable to the founding emperor.

525
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,599
In the shadow of Your Majesty,

526
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:16,079
I’m as dim as the light of a firefly.

527
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,000
I dare not act recklessly.

528
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:19,875
You have a glib tongue.

529
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,560
I didn’t know

530
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,920
you were

531
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,400
honey-tongued.

532
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,425
You’re better than your master.

533
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,040
Well,

534
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:32,400
speaking of your master,

535
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:34,575
I want you to

536
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,014
persuade him on one thing.

537
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,160
I’m going to grant

538
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,560
your master and Miss Ju’s marriage.

539
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,000
They grew up together

540
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,920
from childhood.

541
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,479
In fact, they were engaged long ago.

542
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:47,239
It’s just they’ve been separated
most of the time.

543
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,310
Their wedding has been delayed.

544
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,535
Your master is a fool.

545
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,359
He’s been busy
with business all day long.

546
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,325
He doesn’t care about

547
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,485
anything about the wedding.

548
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,400
We have no right to meddle in

549
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,439
Master’s marriage.

550
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,719
You think highly of me.

551
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,800
That’s true.

552
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,700
Your master

553
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,981
is really to be blamed.

554
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,400
Qiqi is a good girl.

555
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:20,560
If she is going to
take care of domestic affairs,

556
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,700
your master

557
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,980
will live a much better life.

558
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,800
It’s good if Master

559
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:31,595
has a wife to take care of him.

560
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,775
Yeah.

561
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,241
I agree with you on that.

562
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,359
Your Majesty.

563
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,359
I have one request.

564
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,951
Would you please

565
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,359
transfer me to Huangquan Pass?

566
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,050
Oh?

567
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,564
It’s extremely cold
in the northern territory.

568
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,280
Foreign invasion occurs
throughout the year.

569
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,920
Not only women,

570
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
but even supplies
are also hard to deliver.

571
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,359
In there,

572
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,359
you have to open up wasteland

573
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,359
with them.

574
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,650
You’ll have a much harder time.

575
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,760
Do you really want to go?

576
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,200
Huangquan Pass is

577
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,479
the most important pass in the north.

578
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,280
If we can hold the pass,

579
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,439
we can hold the northern border
of Dazheng.

580
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,599
It concerns the people and our country.

581
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,640
I’m not the kind of person
who abuses your love and indulgence

582
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
and concentrates on making profits.

583
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,880
Blessed with imperial graciousness,

584
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:26,479
I should do some
practical things for the court.

585
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:28,550
Yeah.

586
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,841
Good.

587
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,719
You’re such an aspirant as your master.

588
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,520
Good.

589
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,106
You can set out

590
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,265
after your master

591
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:41,695
and Miss Ju’s wedding.

592
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,620
Your Majesty.

593
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,000
I heard a garrison would be relieved

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
at Huangquan Pass recently.

595
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,364
A group of recruits will fill up.

596
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,560
Please don’t make an exception for me.

597
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,125
Let me set out

598
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,324
along with the recruits.

599
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,825
With the recruits?

600
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,000
Isn’t that hasty?

601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
You’ll miss the wedding.

602
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,560
I’m just a Palace Minister.

603
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:10,280
Now that I’ve vowed to
defend Huangquan Pass,

604
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,160
I shouldn’t

605
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,075
have any privileges.

606
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,000
Only then can I work conveniently

607
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,925
after I get there.

608
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:20,975
Yeah.

609
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,079
It’s better to keep a low profile.

610
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,160
In that case,

611
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,425
set out with the recruits.

612
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

613
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,800
I’ll take my leave.

614
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,375
Your Majesty.

615
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,520
Your Majesty. Xiaoguai is not well.

616
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,079
It has loose bowels again

617
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,319
and its spirits are drooping.

618
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,495
Oh?

619
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,375
Well...

620
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,239
Didn’t you say
after taking Dr. Li’s medicine,

621
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,439
it got better?

622
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:51,839
Well...

623
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,400
It did get better.

624
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,650
But now it seems that

625
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,599
its illness just relieved a little.

626
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,675
What should we do?

627
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,040
Xiaoguai’s condition is urgent.

628
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,479
Well...

629
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,000
Your Majesty.

630
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,520
Maybe rabbits can’t take

631
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,079
the same medicine as humans do.

632
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,790
Shall we think of another way?

633
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,239
Xiaobai. Xiaobai.

634
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,400
How did you get out again?

635
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,319
Don’t you like

636
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,525
staying at the Fabric Office?

637
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,319
The girl who held a rabbit that day...

638
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,319
Your Majesty,

639
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,319
it was Zheliu,
an embroiderer of Fabric Office.

640
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,825
Ask her to come here.

641
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,479
Yes.

642
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:31,634
Your Majesty.

643
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,920
Why…

644
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,599
Why does it

645
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,040
still look sick?

646
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,400
Have you fed it with the medicine

647
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
prescribed by Dr. Li?

648
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,270
Yes, I have.

649
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,125
Oh.

650
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,020
OK. Go back to work.

651
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:53,839
What’s wrong with it?

652
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,320
Miss Zheliu arrives.

653
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,521
Come in.

654
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

655
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:06,795
Rise.

656
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,871
Thank you, Your Majesty.

657
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,239
Where’s your rabbit?

658
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,150
Didn’t you bring it?

659
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,520
The eunuch who delivered the order

660
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,719
didn’t ask me to bring it.

661
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,900
I’m going back to get it.

662
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,625
Never mind.

663
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,711
Answer me,

664
00:31:24,075 --> 00:31:25,514
do you know how to keep rabbits?

665
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,000
Your Majesty.

666
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I’ve just kept a rabbit

667
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,359
for a short time.

668
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,760
I know a little about it.

669
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,359
Come here.

670
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,990
All right, stop running around.

671
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,800
Take a closer look.

672
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,359
Isn’t it listless?

673
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,375
May I hold it

674
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,718
for a closer look?

675
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,075
Sure.

676
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,839
It does look listless.

677
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,040
It isn’t just listless.

678
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,680
It also has loose bowels.

679
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

680
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,199
May I ask

681
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,079
what it feeds on?

682
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:19,640
What did you feed it?

683
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,280
Fresh vegetable leaves

684
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,920
and fruits.

685
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,550
Sure,

686
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,050
they were washed clean.

687
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,640
Yeah.

688
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,599
They were washed very clean.

689
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,040
No wonder.

690
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,825
Oh?

691
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,119
Your Majesty,

692
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,400
domesticated rabbits

693
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
can’t always eat

694
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
fresh fruits and vegetables.

695
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,040
It doesn’t matter
if it eats a little occasionally.

696
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,640
But if it always feeds on those,

697
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,319
the rabbit will have loose bowels.

698
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,239
Really?

699
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,599
Over time, it becomes listless.

700
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,199
It may die in severe cases.

701
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,200
Adult rabbits mainly

702
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,599
feed on dry grass

703
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,925
and timothy

704
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,766
with some alfalfa as supplements.

705
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,450
Alfalfa?

706
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,520
Do you know how to treat it?

707
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

708
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,439
Don’t feed it with

709
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,719
fresh vegetables and fruits again.

710
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,640
Don’t give it water for half a day.

711
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:09,375
Yeah.

712
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,359
Grind dry grass and

713
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,359
timothy into powder.

714
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,500
Mix it with dried orange peel powder.

715
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,150
Orange peel?

716
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,760
Ginger slices are helpful, too.

717
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:17,800
Oh.

718
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,675
After a few days,

719
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:19,925
if it gets better,

720
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,771
you can have it fed normally.

721
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:23,075
Oh.

722
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,119
Do you remember?

723
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,040
Your Majesty,

724
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:28,280
I’ve remembered it well.

725
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,599
Did you hear her?

726
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,520
You can’t eat

727
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,800
clean vegetable leaves again.

728
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,554
How is your rabbit?

729
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,319
Your Majesty.

730
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:47,136
Xiaobai is fine.

731
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,101
Bring it here.

732
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,500
So it can accompany this…

733
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:53,450
this rabbit.

734
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,490
It can be its partner.

735
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

736
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,275
Yeah.

737
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,640
You may leave now.

738
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,119
Did you hear her?

739
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,750
You’ll get well soon.

740
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,349
I also find you a companion.

741
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,639
You can’t even raise a rabbit.

742
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,280
I’ve supported you for nothing.

743
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:23,045
Yes.

744
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,479
Yes.

745
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,040
Master.

746
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,879
Pack up and get ready

747
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:45,865
to move into Zhaoming Palace.

748
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:49,035
I’ve asked His Majesty’s permission

749
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,814
to set out for Huangquan Pass.

750
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,400
Huangquan Pass?

751
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,964
It’s a big deal.

752
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,779
Did you just make the decision

753
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
without asking me?

754
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,399
I should’ve discussed it

755
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,919
with you first.

756
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,560
But you’re busy recently

757
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,600
and time is short.

758
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,234
I need to be flexible
in urgent situations.

759
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,199
Is there any reason why you must go?

760
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:18,760
Shoot.

761
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,375
Yes.

762
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,525
I put my heart and soul
to follow your example,

763
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,879
forget all my personal desires,

764
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,520
do whatever I can for the country

765
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,879
and be loyal to His Majesty.

766
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,679
In the capital,

767
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,800
I can gain experience.

768
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,479
But it can’t compare with
being at the northern border.

769
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,159
Huangquan Pass is the
strategic point of Dazheng.

770
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,550
Only being there,

771
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,760
can I face the powerful enemy of Huku.

772
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,239
Fine.

773
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:53,199
It will be of great advantage

774
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,450
to your future.

775
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,025
If you have no more instructions,

776
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,125
I beg your permission to leave.

777
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,050
By the way,

778
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:28,565
since I’m setting out in a few days,

779
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,000
I may miss

780
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,280
you and Miss Ju’s wedding.

781
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,760
There are many lovers in the world,

782
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,439
but not every pair can tie the knot.

783
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,320
Wedding is
the most joyful event in life.

784
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,040
I wish you

785
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,709
live a happy life forever.

786
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:10,275
(Fang)

787
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,120
Master, you talk like an old man.

788
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,760
How many years are you senior to us?

789
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,260
Being several years older made
a big difference when we were young,

790
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,251
while it doesn’t

791
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,301
as we get older.

792
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,811
If it weren’t for taking care of us,

793
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,411
you would’ve been married long ago.

794
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,859
You may have

795
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:40,116
many children now.

796
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
The archery and riding test
is in a few days.

797
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:14,439
You’ve been excellent in it.

798
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,250
Make me proud.

799
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:19,445
Yes, Master.

800
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:21,095
Thank you.

801
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,320
Haishi.

802
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:29,925
Haishi!

803
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,700
They told me

804
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
you were going to defend Huangquan Pass?

805
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,925
Yeah.

806
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,675
If you don’t want to go,

807
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:47,159
ask Master to let His Majesty

808
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,439
recall the order.

809
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,239
Huangquan Pass is remote.

810
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,500
Even I don’t want to go,

811
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,639
let alone you.

812
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,239
I’m going to see Master.

813
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,450
Don’t.

814
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,879
Haishi.

815
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,615
What’s wrong?

816
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,249
Are you afraid His Majesty
will refuse Master?

817
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,879
He won’t.

818
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,520
They are good friends.

819
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,000
His Majesty won’t
make things difficult for you,

820
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,925
otherwise, he wouldn’t have

821
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,040
appointed you as Palace Minister

822
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,520
and let you take
the Imperial Examination.

823
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:15,855
Don’t ask.

824
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:17,719
And,

825
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:19,320
don’t talk nonsense

826
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,239
to Master.

827
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,391
Haishi,

828
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,639
are you hiding something from me?

829
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,520
I asked His Majesty to let me go.

830
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,399
You’re lying!

831
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,040
I’m not lying.

832
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,575
I think

833
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:47,239
we’ve been together
day and night for years.

834
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,120
If I leave,

835
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,840
I’m reluctant to part from you

836
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,180
even if I have a heart of stone.

837
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,650
But I thought it over again.

838
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,159
Look.

839
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,919
Men must go far and
aspire to a great career.

840
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,520
I’m going to do great things
in the future.

841
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,278
If I stay in the capital,

842
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:03,239
I’ll always be inexperienced.

843
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,639
That doesn’t help.

844
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,000
All right.

845
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,320
If you miss me in the future,

846
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,360
wherever I am,

847
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,120
you can always write to me.

848
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:14,639
After I leave,

849
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,199
no one is taking care of
domestic affairs.

850
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,259
There’s one less disciple
to wait upon Master, too.

851
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,115
Miss Ju

852
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,474
won’t come for a while.

853
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,320
You should

854
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,280
take care of all those things.

855
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,399
Remember.

856
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,879
You must be diligent. Don’t slack off.

857
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,399
Miss Ju?

858
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,159
Yes.

859
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,040
Don’t you know?

860
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,080
His Majesty is going to
grant their marriage.

861
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,040
Miss Ju will soon be

862
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,399
the wife of our master.

863
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:51,439
I have to pack up.

864
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:52,475
Let’s talk later.

865
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:07,975
(Fang)

866
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,700
I don’t need meals and refreshments.

867
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:20,624
It’s me. Zhuoying.

868
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,575
Come in.

869
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,239
Master.

870
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,840
Can I help you?

871
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:40,800
Haishi is going to

872
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Huangquan Pass alone.

873
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,959
Do you know that?

874
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:45,600
I know.

875
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:48,439
His Majesty made him Staff Officer
of Huangquan Battalion.

876
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:51,466
We’ll separate

877
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,879
sooner or later.

878
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,679
If he gains military exploit

879
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,800
at Huangquan Battalion,

880
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,775
he’ll get a promotion

881
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,120
and have his own residence
when he comes back.

882
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,445
By then,

883
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:09,575
our family will fall apart.

884
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,125
I was in the old pavilion just now.

885
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,280
I saw Haishi

886
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,479
was crying

887
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,639
while he packed up.

888
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,120
Crying?

889
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,399
Master.

890
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,360
He cried because
you’re getting married!

891
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,479
Don’t talk nonsense!

892
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,300
I didn’t mean that.

893
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,679
I mean

894
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:30,919
Haishi grew up

895
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:31,840
in Jifeng Pavilion from childhood.

896
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,600
He feels close to all of us.

897
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,760
You moved into

898
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,840
Zhaoming Palace with us.

899
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
He stayed behind.

900
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,120
Though he didn’t say anything,

901
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,175
he must think

902
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,200
we’ve drifted apart.

903
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,639
Now you’re getting married.

904
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,080
He thinks he is useless,

905
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,950
so...

906
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,075
Get out.

907
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,919
Master.

908
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,760
Haishi always respects you.

909
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,159
He told me before he left

910
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,000
that I must

911
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,520
take good care of you.

912
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:54,225
If you let him go,

913
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,996
you’ll be unworthy

914
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:57,959
of his sincere heart.

915
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,639
Get out.

916
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,399
Master!

917
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,520
You are so naughty.

918
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,360
You always sneak out

919
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,760
when I don’t pay attention.

920
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,479
Tomorrow,

921
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:49,919
you’re going to accompany Xiaoguai.

922
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:53,439
Today, His Majesty asked me to

923
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:54,800
give medical advice on Xiaoguai.

924
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:56,479
Poor life.

925
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:57,600
It’s been fed with too many

926
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,879
vegetables and fruits.

927
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,040
If they keep doing this,

928
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,520
it will get worse.

929
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:04,919
I wonder

930
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:05,639
if His Majesty will

931
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,120
do as I said.

932
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,199
Xiaobai, what do you think?

933
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:12,520
Will he take my advice

934
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,000
and feed Xiaoguai with medicine and hay?

935
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,600
It must be lonely during illness.

936
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,100
You should keep it company

937
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,501
and help it get better soon.

938
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:33,679
God of Wind,

939
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:34,525
I think Xiaoguai

940
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:36,050
is really unwell today.

941
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,925
It’s so poor.

942
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,075
Please bless it.

943
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:43,556
Help it get better soon.

944
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:51,300
Stab!

945
00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:53,191
Get ready!

946
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:55,879
Stab!

947
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,199
Retract!

948
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:00,280
Stab!

949
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:03,575
Get ready!

950
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,025
Shoot!

951
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,120
Brother.

952
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,925
Brother is coming.

953
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:22,325
Brother.

954
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,360
What’re you doing here?

955
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,250
Brother.

956
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:25,760
We heard that

957
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
you were going to Huangquan Pass

958
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,080
along with the recruits.

959
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,280
We waited here specially

960
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,080
to hold the horse for you.

961
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,725
Have you discussed it

962
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:34,000
with your family?

963
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,800
Of course.

964
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,375
We became friends

965
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,479
during the Imperial Examination.

966
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:38,125
Besides,

967
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,239
you join Huangquan Battalion

968
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,560
for the just cause.

969
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,919
Going with you

970
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,199
to defend the Huangquan Pass

971
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,325
concerns with the safety of Dazheng.

972
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:44,875
Yeah.

973
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,919
How can our family not support us?

974
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:46,600
Yes.

975
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,675
Brother.

976
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:48,560
- Please.
- Please.

977
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,200
Go.

978
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,925
Military camp.

979
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:53,844
Who is here?

980
00:45:54,575 --> 00:45:56,005
Staff Officer of Huangquan Battalion,

981
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:57,225
(Token)
Fang Haishi.

982
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,819
Mr. Fang.

983
00:45:58,819 --> 00:45:59,479
Forgive my rudeness.

984
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:00,225
Please.

985
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,025
Are you Commander Zhang

986
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:11,800
and Commander Fu?

987
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,281
I’m Zhang Chengqian.

988
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:14,399
I’m Fu Yi.

989
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,800
Nice to meet you.

990
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,280
I’m Fang Haishi, Staff Officer
of Huangquan Battalion.

991
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,560
I’m new to the battalion.

992
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,439
I’m looking forward to your advice.

993
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:23,879
We’ve heard for a long time
that Mr. Fang is good

994
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:24,800
at horsemanship and archery,

995
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,959
who is taught by

996
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:27,040
Lord Qinghai himself

997
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:28,800
and is way out of our league.

998
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,800
Today, I see for myself

999
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,199
your heroic posture.

1000
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,840
I’m flattered.

1001
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,159
You’re Lord Qinghai’s disciple.

1002
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,675
Which family do you belong to?

1003
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,239
The Fang Family of Liushang.

1004
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:44,050
It’s a noble family.

1005
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,976
Many generals came from
the family throughout the ages.

1006
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,075
At the beginning of our dynasty,

1007
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,635
the family contributed to
settling down the country.

1008
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,411
It’s a pity
that after the Rebellion of Prince Yi,

1009
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,635
there’re few men left in the family.

1010
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,970
Mr. Fang, your surname is rare.

1011
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,360
We’re deeply affected by hearing it.

1012
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,125
It’s my privilege

1013
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,320
to have the surname.

1014
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,239
I hope I won’t disgrace it

1015
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,879
in the army.

1016
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,439
By the way, sirs,

1017
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,399
they’re friends I made

1018
00:47:11,399 --> 00:47:13,199
during the Imperial Examination.

1019
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,239
Could they come along with me?

1020
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:16,320
If they can,

1021
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,159
please make some arrangements.

1022
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,520
Since they’re your friends,

1023
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
they surely can stay.

1024
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,529
I’ll let someone

1025
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:22,679
register their census register.

1026
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,560
They can stay from today.

1027
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,320
Great.

1028
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,560
Great.

1029
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,280
Thank you, sir.

1030
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,125
Don’t mention it.

1031
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,200
Everyone,

1032
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,719
though you’re my friends,

1033
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,520
there are strict rules in the army.

1034
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,399
You must abide by the rules.

1035
00:47:36,399 --> 00:47:37,479
Don’t violate any laws.

1036
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:39,280
Yes. Mr. Fang.

1037
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,760
Mr. Zhang.

1038
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,479
Take them to register.

1039
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:46,125
Yes.

1040
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,879
