Amazing.

26
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,080
How much longer do we need to learn

27
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,080
to embroider so well?

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
- Right.
- Right.

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,030
The embroidery skills are excellent.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,190
Greetings, Lord Qinghai.

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,910
My lord.

32
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,080
Miss Ju,

33
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,390
I have something to say to you.

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,960
Liu.

35
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,910
Tea.

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
No need.

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,750
Madam?

38
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,190
My lord.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
Since my father has passed away,

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,110
I told you that

41
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,030
you are no longer a retainer of mine.

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,670
We’re only colleagues of
the Secret Force.

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
No need to call

44
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,190
me Lord anymore.

45
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,550
Do you come to Fabric Office

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
about some official business?

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
As you know,

48
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,160
I inherited the peerage.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,110
So the past between us

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,030
was brought up again.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,390
I came here today

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,800
to make myself clear.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,910
After Ciqin passed away,

54
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,240
I once swore that

55
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
I would neither amass personal wealth

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,520
nor get married.

57
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,240
That I would devote myself to the nation

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,830
and make contributions diligently.

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,800
Though a promise was made

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,880
between our parents,

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,080
you and I never made any.

62
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,960
I hope you don’t waste time anymore.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,600
It turns out that

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,880
you came here

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,440
to tell me these.

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,030
Miss Ju,

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,030
don’t waste your life anymore.

68
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,830
Lord Qinghai, don’t worry.

69
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,000
I understand.

70
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,390
I never had

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,040
unrealistic thoughts.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Sorry about the disturbance, then.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
I still have business to attend to.

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,920
Goodbye.

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,830
Lord Qinghai!

76
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,640
It’s been years.

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,160
I have gotten used to it.

78
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,070
I have regarded you as…

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,350
As my big brother from long ago.

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Miss Ju.

81
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,830
How about you go back to the room
and get some rest?

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Let’s...

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,270
Let’s go.

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,040
Madam,

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
you look terrible.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
Do you need me

87
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,640
to get a physician here
to feel your pulse?

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
Go fetch a brazier.

89
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,720
Madam, what’s that for?

90
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,320
Do you feel cold?

91
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,480
Brazier.

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,790
Yes.

93
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,880
- Easy.
- The table.

94
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
If it’s too heavy, get someone to help.

95
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,920
This is Haishi’s

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,790
favorite thing.

97
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,760
Don’t break it.

98
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,070
Okay, Young Master Zhuoying.

99
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,760
Master,

100
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,600
we’ve moved Haishi’s stuff here.

101
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,510
As you ordered,

102
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,550
we’ve decorated it

103
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,440
according to the old house.

104
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,200
I’m sure Haishi will be overjoyed.

105
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,440
Master,

106
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,710
one thing confuses me.

107
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,440
Haishi said

108
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,000
previously, you kept him
in the old house

109
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,880
because it was convenient
for your wedding.

110
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,030
And then

111
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,030
you said

112
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,590
he wasn’t needed
to arrange your wedding anymore,

113
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
so all of his stuff

114
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,910
was moved into Zhaoming Palace.

115
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,320
All the back-and-forthing.

116
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,350
Why?

117
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,350
He likes to make assumptions.

118
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,350
Many of those words
I have never actually said.

119
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,790
Never actually said?

120
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,200
Then why?

121
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,150
Why?

122
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,640
Here. Take it.

123
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

124
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
What?

125
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,350
We’re heading to west from southeast.

126
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,520
Before the snow blocks
the mountain every October,

127
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
people can run into those

128
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
audacious Leizhou merchants

129
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,670
moving safflower, ceiba

130
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,080
and musk into Jiaman.

131
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
(Zheng)

132
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,280
Supposedly, one hundred and
thirty thousand people in total

133
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
are going to spend their winter
at Huangquan Pass this year.

134
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,320
Huku people wouldn’t

135
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,910
choose to ask for trouble at this time.

136
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,710
The way to Hanzhou

137
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,110
should be safer.

138
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,280
But along the way,

139
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,640
it’s bizarrely quiet.

140
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,910
Zhunian people.

141
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,280
Nihualuo people.

142
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,200
Nanpi people.

143
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,030
I saw neither of them.

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,320
You mean

145
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,110
Huku people have arrived
at Huangquan Pass?

146
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,790
If they had planned to attack
Huangquan Pass,

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,790
we would have got the information

148
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,000
when we traveled past Shuanghuan City.

149
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,910
But in this season,

150
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
all the seasonal springs

151
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,080
in the Gobi Desert have dried up.

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Other than the near-river canyon
of Mount Piluo

153
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,640
where water and grass can be seen,

154
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,400
everywhere else is barren

155
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,910
and the terrain is treacherous.

156
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,550
Except Huangquan Pass,

157
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,030
where else can they go?

158
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,280
It’s snowing.

159
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,840
It’s only the end of September,

160
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,880
and it’s already snowing here.

161
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,710
Snow?

162
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,400
The glacier.

163
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,590
They traveled across the glacier.

164
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,150
The glacier?

165
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,590
It is passable for human beings?

166
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,960
In recent years,

167
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,670
the glacier has melted a little.

168
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,110
The climate got warmer.

169
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,790
The ten-meter-deep gaps

170
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,280
between the glacier tongues and rocks

171
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,280
were slowly filled by muddy water,

172
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
and refroze in winter,

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,670
so it’s become smoother.

174
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,960
But

175
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,150
in this case,

176
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,960
the glacier is more
slippery and friable,

177
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,470
unable to be walked on.

178
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
If there’s too much trembling,

179
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,110
an avalanche may be caused.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,520
That’s why

181
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,520
only less than two thousand
of our soldiers

182
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,440
are stationed in Well Town
before the glacier.

183
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,080
But in this year,

184
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,280
it snowed in Hanzhou
at the end of August.

185
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,640
I’m afraid the Huku grasslands

186
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,280
were buried in September,

187
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,320
no,

188
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,230
at the end of August.

189
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,790
In the once-every-half-a-century

190
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,520
rigorous cold,

191
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,760
even the glacier is dead frozen.

192
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,760
Other than the canyon of Piluo

193
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,910
and Huangquan Pass,

194
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,760
the glacier

195
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,280
is the best way.

196
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
Also, the rugged terrain

197
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
better hides the procession.

198
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,280
If I were a Huku,

199
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,520
I’d rather walk on the glacier.

200
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,080
I believe they didn’t

201
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,520
bring enough provisions,

202
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,760
so they’ll pillage the people.

203
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,110
Yes.

204
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,400
Ten kilometers out of the glacier

205
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,550
is Well Town.

206
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,030
Only less than two thousand
soldiers garrison the town.

207
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,840
And only a little more than

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
two thousand civilians
cultivate the barren land over there.

209
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,590
All the traveling merchants

210
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,960
get their replenishment in town.

211
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,110
We’re one hundred
and twenty-five kilometers

212
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,280
away from Huangquan Pass,

213
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,350
eighty-five kilometers from Well Town,

214
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,790
transporting winter provisions for

215
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,030
one hundred and thirty thousand people.

216
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,320
Mr. Zhang,

217
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
you transport the food
back to the battalion.

218
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,960
I’ll lead some people to Well Town.

219
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,400
This is your first mission,

220
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,760
and no one leads the way. This is...

221
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,710
No need for that.

222
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,030
We’ll

223
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,000
follow our brother.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,520
Yeah.

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,200
We’ll follow our brother.

226
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,670
Mr. Zhang,

227
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,400
you’re responsible for the
transportation of winter provisions

228
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,520
for one hundred
and thirty thousand people,

229
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,840
so you mustn’t be distracted.

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,280
However, the threat to Well Town

231
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
needs to be handled.

232
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,710
They are all Dazheng soldiers.

233
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
Our morale can’t afford to be damaged.

234
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,520
The provisions come first.

235
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,000
Let’s return to the battalion,

236
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,470
then send troops to Well Town.

237
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,000
Sending troops
after we return to the battalion?

238
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,550
I’m afraid it’d be too late.

239
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Vice General Li. Vice General Zheng.

240
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,440
Here!

241
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
You lead two thousand soldiers

242
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,400
under the command of Mr. Fang

243
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,880
to reinforce Well Town.

244
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,550
- Yes!
- Yes!

245
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,280
We’d like to go, too.

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,230
- And us.
- And us.

247
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,840
Mr. Zhang,

248
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,400
I’m off.

249
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,980
(Zheng)

250
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,470
Go.

251
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,110
Go.

252
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,670
Everyone!

253
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,880
Ready to set out!

254
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,790
We must return to

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
the battalion before tomorrow nightfall!

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
Master.

257
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,710
The message about Boot Camp
of Huangquan Battalion has arrived.

258
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,710
The Camp has reached

259
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
the Gobi Desert in Hanzhou.

260
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,030
Two days later,

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,640
they’ll arrive at Huangquan Pass.

262
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,670
They are about
to reach the destination at last.

263
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
Any movements at Huangquan Pass?

264
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,840
Master,

265
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,840
no update

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,110
on Huangquan Pass.

267
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,350
General Tang.

268
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,440
Mr. Zhang.

269
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,760
Mr. Fu.

270
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,110
Recruits of Huangquan Battalion
and winter provisions

271
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,910
have arrived safely.

272
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,230
The mission is heavy
and the journey is long.

273
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,520
Your hard work is much appreciated.

274
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,520
How come I don’t see the new
staff officer of Huangquan Battalion,

275
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,670
Fang Haishi?

276
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
Upon knowing Well Town
was exposed to danger,

277
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
Mr. Fang went to reinforce them.

278
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,350
It was a decision urgently made.

279
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,550
Please forgive us for

280
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,200
not informing you.

281
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,000
I didn’t expect Officer Fang

282
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,910
would head to Well Town.

283
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
The battle is indeed on in Well Town.

284
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,960
Let’s talk in my camp.

285
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,710
Please.

286
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,560
(Huangquan Battalion)

287
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,790
- General Tang.
- General Tang.

288
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,400
General Tang.

289
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,280
How’s the battle looking in Well Town?

290
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,590
Although it isn’t
the main force of Huku,

291
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,760
the number of the enemy is large.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,760
It’s a raid, and the snow
makes things worse,

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,030
so the message came late.

294
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,960
We were just informed of the battle,

295
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,030
and are making a plan.

296
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,470
But according to our knowledge

297
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,440
of Huku people’s craziness,

298
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,350
as we speak,

299
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,280
Well Town has probably

300
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,200
been razed to the ground.

301
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,640
Besides,

302
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,710
due to the frozen glacier on the way,

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
more messages are yet to arrive.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,880
If Huku people make a diversion,

305
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,110
and their main force means
to attack Huangquan Battalion,

306
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,710
there will be another intense battle
at Huangquan Pass.

307
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,910
In this case, we’ll have to choose to

308
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,200
abandon Well Town

309
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,470
and give priority to Huangquan Pass.

310
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,910
Not a single inch of Dazheng territory

311
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,880
shall be given away.

312
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,280
Also, there are two thousand soldiers
in Well Town.

313
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,670
Mr. Fang has led reinforcements there.

314
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,840
If we give it up,

315
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,030
putting the great loss aside,

316
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,080
who will be willing to
garrison Well Town again?

317
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,790
Who will be willing to safeguard
the frontier of Dazheng in the future?

318
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,350
Mr. Zhang, you make a good point.

319
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,000
But between Huangquan Pass
and Well Town,

320
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:38,960
which one is more important?

321
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,000
I guess you have the answer.

322
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,960
Moreover,

323
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,880
there’s a long distance

324
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,880
between Well Town
and Huangquan Pass.

325
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,320
Even if we head to there
at full speed at once,

326
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
all we end up

327
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,710
seeing will only be the ruins.

328
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,080
No more argument.

329
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,030
I think

330
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,670
Mr. Zhang is right.

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,030
Not a single inch of Dazheng territory

332
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,280
shall be given away.

333
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,550
I’ll immediately order two vice generals

334
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,280
to lead their men
to reinforce Well Town.

335
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
General Tang, please...

336
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,840
Report!

337
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,110
General,

338
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,150
message from the sentry

339
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,040
says a group of people

340
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
are galloping towards the battalion.

341
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,070
What force do they serve?

342
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,520
They’re carrying the flags of Dazheng.

343
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,190
The leader is a
low-ranking military officer.

344
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,070
From the armor,
he looks like a staff officer.

345
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,590
It’s Mr. Fang.

346
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,440
(Huangquan Battalion)

347
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,040
Mr. Zhang.

348
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,920
How was it?

349
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,070
Huku invaders have temporarily

350
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,190
withdrawn from Well Town.

351
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,070
There were over three thousand
and two hundred of them.

352
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,110
More than half fled.

353
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,470
The rest wouldn’t surrender.

354
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,040
We did very hard work to

355
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
keep more than twenty alive.

356
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,110
Currently, people in Well Town

357
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,680
are busy digging a trench.

358
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,590
Their defense is weak,

359
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,230
so I came to apply for more soldiers.

360
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,640
General Tang,

361
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,470
this is Officer Fang.

362
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,880
Mr. Fang is young and valiant.

363
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,400
We met in Jubei Town.

364
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,520
I’m Fang Haishi
of Huangquan Battalion.

365
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
Greetings, General Tang.

366
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,110
Vice General Lu. Vice General Chen.

367
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,760
Here!

368
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,280
You lead your men

369
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,280
to Well Town

370
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,430
and reinforce the local garrison.

371
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,040
Yes!

372
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,470
General Tang,

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,520
Well Town is in a dire situation.

374
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,000
I can go with them.

375
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,160
Vice General Lu and Vice General Chen

376
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
are enough.

377
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,160
When the trench is dug,

378
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,070
the passage on the glacier

379
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,190
will be blocked.

380
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,800
You don’t need to go to Well Town again.

381
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,680
Stay in the battalion.

382
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,920
We need more good men here.

383
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,880
General Tang,

384
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,400
we fought and rode all day.

385
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,590
Could you please prepare

386
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,920
some food for my brothers

387
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,950
behind me

388
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,070
and heal their wounds?

389
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,400
You’re young,

390
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,710
but you’ve learned the good qualities

391
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,760
from Lord Qinghai.

392
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,040
Soldiers,

393
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,830
prepare food and medicine

394
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,590
for these brothers.

395
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,350
Yes.

396
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
That’s just flesh wound, you wimp.

397
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,190
Won’t you screech
if I poke right at your wound?

398
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Won’t you feel the pain?

399
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,830
Remember what you were like
in Well Town?

400
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,800
What was wrong with me?

401
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,400
What was I like?

402
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,710
You really don’t know?

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,190
I’m wounded, too.

404
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,230
Guys.

405
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,000
General Tang is here to visit you.

406
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,310
General Tang.

407
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,760
General Tang.

408
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,560
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Fang.

409
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,710
Whether the wound is heavy or light,

410
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,760
treat them equally with care.

411
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,430
These are all men who spilled blood

412
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,710
for Dazheng.

413
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,400
They’ll continue serving Dazheng.

414
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
Be serious about your job.

415
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,350
Yes.

416
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,640
The wound may be painful,

417
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,230
but through the trial of blood,

418
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,110
you’ve become a real man.

419
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,000
You’re right, General.

420
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,110
Well Town

421
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,470
was indeed a trial.

422
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
If it weren’t for our brother’s

423
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,560
bravery and practical tactics,

424
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,710
not only would we be dead,

425
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,520
which isn’t a big deal,

426
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
but Well Town would also

427
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,830
be lost.

428
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Thanks to our brother,

429
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,680
we got to survive.

430
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,310
- Thank you, Brother.
- Thank you, Mr. Fang.

431
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,470
General,

432
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
our brother worked out the tactic

433
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,800
of attacking the enemy from three sides,

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,470
leaving only one

435
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,590
direction for them to escape.

436
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,470
Soldiers and civilians fought the enemy
together under his command.

437
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,110
Guys, imagine that.

438
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,400
How could Huku soldiers

439
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,560
withstand the joint attack

440
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,350
of the soldiers and the civilians

441
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,470
from three sides?

442
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,110
That was impossible.

443
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,640
Right.

444
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,760
And as expected,

445
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,310
the enemy had to escape

446
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,230
in the direction that Brother

447
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,310
showed them.

448
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Right before

449
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
they intended to escape,

450
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,000
in a flash,

451
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,000
Brother landed

452
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,560
on the clay wall at the west gate.

453
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,400
Quickly! Quickly!

454
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,280
Go!

455
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,310
Hurry! Quickly!

456
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,590
Now, let’s go back to Well Town.

457
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,470
The noises of celebration!

458
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,190
The fireworks!

459
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,830
The flags of triumph!

460
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,160
General.

461
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,110
All in all,

462
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,230
under our brother’s command,

463
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,800
we managed to drive Huku people away,

464
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,110
and recapture Well Town.

465
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,430
I find that

466
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,040
you weren’t so active in battle

467
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,800
whereas now, you are quite vivacious.

468
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,680
You

469
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,280
should have never joined the army.

470
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,680
You should be a storyteller.

471
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,310
Come on,

472
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,430
what did I do?

473
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,070
I mean,

474
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,280
I’m telling the truth.

475
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,190
Am I right?

476
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,070
- Yeah.
- Right.

477
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,070
If it weren’t true,

478
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,070
you would have been gagged long ago.

479
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,880
Alright, alright.

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,760
Enough.

481
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,110
OK.

482
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,110
Mr. Fang is valiant,

483
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,400
and you are all brave warriors,

484
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,430
elites in the army.

485
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Fires have been set by my order,

486
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,760
goats are slaughtered,

487
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,520
and meals are cooked.

488
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,310
Tonight, we feast you all

489
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,230
to celebrate your victory.

490
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,160
Great!

491
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,760
- Great!
- Great!

492
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,040
It’s cold at the frontier.

493
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,640
The winter is upon us.

494
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,680
It is the toughest time

495
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,760
of the year.

496
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,350
We’ve got millet,

497
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,430
mutton, and wine.

498
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,760
This is the best welcoming feast
we can offer.

499
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,430
Mr. Fang,

500
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
the credit belongs to you

501
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,760
for you decisively

502
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,000
rushed to Well Town’s rescue.

503
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,470
Well Town had
more than a thousand casualties.

504
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,110
It really makes me feel bad.

505
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,830
I don’t deserve your compliment.

506
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,800
The atrociousness and brutality
of Huku people

507
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,800
are visible to everybody.

508
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,760
Most fortunately,

509
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,430
you prevented Well Town soldiers

510
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,070
and civilians from destruction.

511
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,590
In battles at the frontier,

512
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,040
humans are like weed.

513
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,590
Honor and disgrace

514
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,710
are witnessed by god.

515
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:39,950
Here.

516
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,800
Bottoms up.

517
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,400
Please.

518
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
What? Feeling uncomfortable?

519
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,400
It’s young Mr. Fang’s first battle,

520
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,000
and it was gory,

521
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,760
so it’s normal to feel nauseous.

522
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,920
We all went through this stage.

523
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,350
Over time, you’ll get used to it.

524
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,310
Yes.

525
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
In the future,

526
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
we’ll count more on

527
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,070
young and fierce leaders like Mr. Fang

528
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,040
to fight enemies

529
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,430
and defeat Huku.

530
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,830
You’d better get used to it
as soon as possible.

531
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,950
No one is a natural killer.

532
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,830
When I met Mr. Fang for the first time,

533
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,830
others addressed him as

534
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,000
Young Master Haishi.

535
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,430
He seemed a middle-sized man

536
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,520
with a fair face.

537
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,640
He looked more like

538
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,430
a counselor than a warrior.

539
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,680
It is unexpected that

540
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,000
when he fights,

541
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,800
he fights fiercely.

542
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,920
I’m really impressive.

543
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,520
You overrated me, General Tang.

544
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,400
It was our joint effort

545
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,230
that fended off the enemy.

546
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,680
You’ve taken in the traits
of the Fang Family of Liushang.

547
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,560
The current householder of
the Fang Family of Liushang

548
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,190
is Fang Jianming, Lord Qinghai.

549
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,470
He led an army to war at the age of 14.

550
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,190
He rode across two sides,

551
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,470
making six armies bow down

552
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,160
and the enemy general break the arrow.

553
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,230
When I heard that he died of illness,

554
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,920
I got quite emotional.

555
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,310
I didn’t expect that

556
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,710
Lord Qinghai is still alive.

557
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,590
The world is full of wonders.

558
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,190
Fate works in mysterious ways.

559
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,190
When you reach Huangquan Battalion,

560
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
you must safeguard Tang Qianzi
best you can

561
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,760
like the way you safeguard me.

562
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,950
If you receive my letter
from the capital city,

563
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,310
regardless of the content,

564
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,950
kill him at once.

565
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,880
Come.

566
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,950
Cheers.

567
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,040
Right.

568
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,280
Fate works in mysterious ways.

569
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,470
Mr. Fang,

570
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,590
you ranked the third
in the Palace Examination,

571
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,110
so I’m sure you once met
His Majesty in the Palace.

572
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,470
How is His Majesty doing?

573
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,830
His Majesty is doing fine.

574
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,950
How are Lord Chang

575
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,470
and Consort Shurong?

576
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,880
They’re both doing well.

577
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,560
I heard Lord Chang is immersed in

578
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,400
breeding his eagles every day.

579
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,110
Consort Shurong

580
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,190
fell ill after she moved
into the Palace,

581
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,160
but she got well shortly.

582
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,400
I’m glad they’re all fine.

583
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,800
I’m glad they’re all fine.

584
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,070
My king,

585
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,040
they’re still repairing

586
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,000
the trench under the glacier.

587
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,950
It appears they didn’t notice

588
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,920
that we’ve reached here

589
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,110
along the glacier at all.

590
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,040
Duoluo’s idea worked.

591
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,520
The tactic of diversion.

592
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,830
The attack of only three thousand
people on Well Town

593
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,000
has successfully covered

594
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,160
the infiltration of
the entire Left Tribe of Huku.

595
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,880
Only with a little care,

596
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,800
a little more care,

597
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,110
Huangquan Pass shall be ours.

598
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,520
Master,

599
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,230
a message from Huangquan Battalion.

600
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,180
(Huku detachments raided
Well Town in the snow.)

601
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,040
(When we get the message,
it’s already late.)

602
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,760
(I’m afraid the main force
of Huku troops played diversion.)

603
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,070
It looks like someone
intentionally cut off

604
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,710
the source of information
on Huku’s side.

605
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,280
There’s a mole.

606
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Master,

607
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,590
the intelligence network in Hanzhou

608
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,920
has to be repaired at once.

609
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,470
If there’s another delay of message,

610
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,190
I’m afraid a bigger price will be paid.

611
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,560
This time, Haishi
embraced the challenge

612
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,800
to secure Well Town.

613
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,590
Next time,

614
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,310
it may get Huangquan Pass in trouble.

615
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,560
It needs a thorough plan.

616
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,430
On the surface, we’re renewing

617
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,710
the intelligence network

618
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,880
but in fact,

619
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,430
you are to quietly

620
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,110
plant other informants.

621
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,680
The two sides are to operate separately.

622
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,590
No overlap.

623
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
No leak of information.

624
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,160
You’ll be in charge of the
new spy network.

625
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,590
Wait for an opportunity in patience
to lure the enemy out.

626
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,190
Yes.

627
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,350
I’ll be on the job.

628
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,350
Master,

629
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,950
do we inform

630
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,470
Haishi about it?

631
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
I’m worried that

632
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,070
once he…

633
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,310
It took months

634
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,830
for you to recover.

635
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,470
You should

636
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,590
pay attention to your health,
Your Highness.

637
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Don’t do things that are

638
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,190
none of your concern.

639
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,430
Bizi has a good point.

640
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,040
Last time in the South Palace,

641
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,310
I could tell that

642
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,230
although His Majesty is
capricious in temperament,

643
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,000
with a submissive attitude,

644
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,880
you still

645
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,590
have a way to survive in the Palace.

646
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,950
After all…

647
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
After all, on account of

648
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,230
Empress Zizan,

649
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,160
life is long.

650
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,520
He’ll spare some attention to you.

651
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,830
I would not like to cheat.

652
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,950
Your Highness.

653
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,070
You miss Xiaoguai, right?

654
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,680
I don’t know

655
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
what the emperor was thinking.

656
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,350
Even a rabbit is banned.

657
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,680
Xiaoguai never irritated

658
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,920
him in Yu’an Palace.

659
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,710
It’s not necessarily a good thing
to stay in Yu’an Palace.

660
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,830
Luckily, we have Eunuch Mu.

661
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,680
I heard that some eunuchs

662
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,280
are taking care of Xiaoguai,

663
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,760
and they are doing a good job.

664
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,760
Your Highness.

665
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,040
Miss Bizi, a word, please.

666
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Miss Bizi.

667
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,160
Your Highness,

668
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,310
we’ve got some updates.

669
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,160
So?

670
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,310
Young Master Haishi and the troops

671
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,710
have reached Huangquan Pass.

672
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,160
Along the way,

673
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,190
he rushed to Well Town

674
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,800
commanding only two thousand people

675
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,040
to beat off over three thousand
Huku invaders.

676
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,230
He secured Well Town.

677
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,520
A triumph for his first battle.

678
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,590
Is he injured?

679
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,310
The guards of Jifeng Pavilion

680
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,710
said he fought bravely

681
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,680
and wasn’t injured at all.

682
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Great.

683
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,640
Young Master Haishi

684
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,830
won his first battle uninjured.

685
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,950
Another fierce warrior

686
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,880
is in Zhenchu’s force.

687
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,560
Dragon Tail blesses us.

688
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,710
It is indeed superb.

689
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But you need to be careful

690
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
when obtaining
such information in the future.

691
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,760
If the emperor of Dazheng finds out,

692
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,160
Her Highness will be in trouble.

693
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,400
You two

694
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,110
get some colored paper for me.

695
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,710
It’s no festival at the moment,

696
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
why would you need colored paper?

697
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,350
Just go.

698
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,680
Yes.

699
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,070
Your Majesty,

700
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,190
today’s dishes
don’t cater to your taste, right?

701
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,350
If they don’t,

702
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,920
venison and bland congee

703
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,920
are on the stove.

704
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,920
No need.

705
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,400
Warm up another jug of wine.

706
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,590
Your Majesty,

707
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,560
please curb your alcohol intake.

708
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,000
Overdrinking may damage your organs.

709
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,760
Sorry for being mouthy.

710
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,000
Your Majesty!

711
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,880
“Sleep upstairs.

712
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,590
The setting Moon is below the curtain.”

713
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,000
May Dragon Tail bless everybody

714
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,590
with peace, good health,

715
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,230
and happiness in the next year.

716
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,430
Jianming is drunk.

717
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,430
He’s probably fallen for a girl.

718
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,070
Throw him into the water to
sober him up, then.

719
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,070
I’m not drunk.

720
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,590
Do what you like.
I’m not afraid of the water.

721
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,520
You are.

722
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,230
So you’re afraid of the water, Xu.

723
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,560
I’m not!

724
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
Now, now.

725
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,520
If you do fall into the water,

726
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,470
I’ll save you

727
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,830
with my life.

728
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,350
You’re not drunk?

729
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,280
Let’s keep drinking.

730
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
(Three Flower Spirits)

731
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,280
“Dream of the melancholy in Moling.

732
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,880
Peach blossoms and catkins
pervade Jiang City.

733
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,680
Girl with twin buns sits
and plays Sheng.”

734
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,800
Hurry up, Your Highness.

735
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,760
If we get caught,

736
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,150
there will be trouble again.

737
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,560
The war at the frontier is
nerve-racking.

738
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,670
His Majesty is caught up with

739
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,470
the heavy political affairs.

740
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,190
Others won’t poke their nose

741
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,360
into our business.

742
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,560
And Shuangping Lake

743
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,630
is remote and sequestered.

744
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,120
Don’t worry.

745
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,120
May Dragon Tail bless

746
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,120
Zhenchu

747
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,670
and Young Master Haishi with safety.

748
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,710
They must be safe.

749
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,800
Your Majesty, be careful.

750
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Watch your steps.

751
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Don’t slip.

752
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,670
Your Majesty!

753
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,280
What is this?

754
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,470
It’s a water lantern.

755
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,080
This thing isn’t allowed in the Palace.

756
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,870
I’ll ask people to find out who did it.

757
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,470
No need.

758
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,840
Your Majesty.

759
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,760
Where is the liqueur for Dragon Tail?

760
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,710
I forgot it.

761
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,320
The box was left in the pavilion.

762
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,000
Bihong and I will go fetch it.

763
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,320
Okay. Be quick.

764
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,390
Your Majesty, uh…

765
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,080
Zizan.

766
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,870
Zizan.

767
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
It’s been so long.

768
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,840
Do you know how much I miss you?

769
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,390
Your Majesty.

770
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,470
Could you not leave?

771
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,230
Your Majesty.

772
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
- Your Majesty, you’re drunk...
- Don’t go.

773
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,150
So you’re afraid of the water, Xu.

774
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,670
Now, now.

775
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,630
If you do fall into the water,

776
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,320
I’ll save you

777
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,430
with my life.

778
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,190
Cold.

779
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,600
Cold.

780
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,430
It’ll be warm soon.

781
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,950
- Cold.
- I’m covering you up.

782
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,390
Soon, you’ll be warmed up.

783
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,710
Zizan.

784
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,230
I’m so happy.

785
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,600
You’re awake.

786
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,390
Why are you here?

787
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,870
Yesterday,

788
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,670
you fell into the water by accident.

789
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,040
You were shocked and got a cold,

790
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,230
and Eunuch Mu asked me to stay.

791
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,760
So I kept you company.

792
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,630
Kept me company?

793
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,230
I never asked you to keep me company.

794
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,560
Jincheng Palace is where
Your Majesty lives and sleeps.

795
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,150
It can’t be entered without summoning.

796
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,670
I’m guilty.

797
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,710
I was drunk last night.

798
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,150
If it hadn’t been for you,

799
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,760
something unthinkable
would have happened.

800
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:07,950
Tilan,

801
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,120
you’re meritorious.

802
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,040
Rise.

803
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,870
This is what I’m obligated to do.

804
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
I don’t deserve the praise.

805
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,360
I always put the saddle
on the right horse.

806
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,630
Nor do I enjoy owing anyone a favor.

807
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,560
You can make any request you like.

808
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,800
Thanks to your kindness,

809
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,040
ever since I returned to Yu’an Palace,

810
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,470
food, garments, and necessities

811
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,150
have been sufficient.

812
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,150
Living in a good life,

813
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,670
I’m content.

814
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,950
The most important thing right now

815
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,870
is to get an imperial physician here

816
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
to feel your pulse.

817
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,870
You choked on water,
so you are vulnerable to cold.

818
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,800
You mustn’t be sick.

819
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,430
I’m fine.

820
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,760
However, you

821
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,390
are still wearing the clothes
from yesterday.

822
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,430
Where is Mu Deqing?

823
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,870
Couldn’t he find a set of dry clothes

824
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
for you?

825
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,600
It isn’t his fault.

826
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,630
I wanted to change my clothes

827
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,320
after you fell in deep sleep,

828
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,320
but I somehow fell asleep first.

829
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,520
Step down.

830
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,360
Remember to ask them

831
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,470
to brew medicine for you.

832
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,150
Don’t go out these days.

833
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,430
Recuperate in peace.

834
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,120
Yes.

835
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,600
Wait.

836
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,080
Did they send that rabbit

837
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,360
back to you?

838
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,910
What are you talking about,
Your Majesty?

839
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,150
I’m saying

840
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,320
it’s not appropriate

841
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,470
for me to keep the rabbit here.

842
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,600
Don’t forget to ask them
to send it back to you.

843
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,150
No kneeling.

844
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,910
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your understanding.

845
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,000
My lord, this way.

846
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,080
Your Highness.

847
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,670
Lord Qinghai.

848
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,360
Your Highness.

849
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,230
Your Majesty.

850
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:37,910
Who is it?

851
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,670
Lord Qinghai asks to see you.

852
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,560
Come in.

853
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,840
Yes.

854
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,040
Your Majesty.

855
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,390
My trifling incident

856
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,040
even bothers you?

857
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,800
I have a report.

858
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,320
A report of victory from Huangquan Pass

859
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,360
has arrived.

860
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,040
Tang Qianzi really knows

861
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,280
when to take a back seat.

862
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,600
Every word of his

863
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,800
is praising Fang Haishi.

864
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,950
As if without him,

865
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,760
Well Town would be lost.

866
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:08,470
What?

867
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,230
You didn’t come here urgently

868
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,840
to see me,

869
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,670
but to ask reward for Fang Haishi?

870
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,670
I came today

871
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:19,390
to discuss with you

872
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,760
about how to strengthen

873
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,280
our spy network in Hanzhou,

874
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,360
and the military deployment
at Huangquan Pass.

875
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,280
The frontier is unstable.

876
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,670
I think

877
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,040
Huku’s attack on Well Town

878
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,710
isn’t as simple as it seems.

879
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,870
You’re worried about Huangquan Pass

880
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,390
or you’re worried about

881
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,870
your favorite disciple, Fang Haishi?

882
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,040
I know

883
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,390
that you have

884
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,430
had your men deal with the missing spy.

885
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,470
Any information?

886
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,190
No firm evidence yet.

887
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,560
How the information about the spy

888
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,950
got spread out

889
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,360
requires further
investigation and confirmation.

890
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,120
The spy network in Hanzhou

891
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,120
has always been Qiqi’s responsibility.

892
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,430
She must have been overwrought lately.

893
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,560
The war at the frontier
is indeed important,

894
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
but with its natural barrier,

895
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,040
Huangquan Pass

896
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,280
isn’t that easy to be broken into.

897
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,950
Your wedding, however,

898
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,470
cannot be delayed by the war.

899
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,320
My wedding?

900
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
When Fang Haishi took the order

901
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
of heading to Huangquan Pass,

902
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,040
I told him that

903
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,840
I would marry Qiqi to you.

904
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,280
Didn’t he tell you that?

905
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,280
I have no intention to get married.

906
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,150
And don’t bring it up again

907
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,230
in case Miss Ju’s time is wasted.

908
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,430
Have no intention to get married?

909
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:48,430
Fang Jianming,

910
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,080
Qiqi treats you with love.

911
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,600
Do you want her to be laughed at

912
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,430
by the entire Tianqi City

913
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,600
and people in the imperial palace?

914
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,840
I have made up my mind.

915
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,190
- Please don’t pressure me anymore.
- You…

916
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,430
Apart from Huangquan Pass,

917
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,280
Chen Heran has also

918
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,630
submitted three reports

919
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,760
about the alliance of Tuhuolu

920
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,950
and Nihualuo.

921
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,320
I’m afraid the southwest
will be unstable in the future,

922
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,800
and the national affairs are grueling.

923
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,430
I have no spare time.

924
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,520
Please, Your Majesty.
The national security comes first.

925
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,080
Don’t pressure me.

926
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,080
I now understand.

927
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,360
Fine.

928
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,600
From today on,

929
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,390
the renewal of spies

930
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:26,230
on Huku’s side

931
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,390
will be handled by Miss Ju.

932
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,470
Your Majesty!

933
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,150
The national affairs are grueling,

934
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,230
and you have no spare time, right?

935
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,080
Okay, then.

936
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,320
Reduce your workload

937
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,190
to some extent

938
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,630
in case people

939
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,600
say that I’m too hard on my liegemen.

940
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,430
About the intelligence network,

941
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,560
I haven’t had a result.

942
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,230
It may be human factor,

943
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,870
or it may be a coincidence.

944
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,670
If someone did it,

945
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,910
then we are at a disadvantage.

946
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,040
In addition, Miss Ju has an eye disease.

947
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,630
What?

948
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,150
Now, you worry about

949
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,280
Qiqi’s eye disease?

950
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,520
At the very least,

951
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,360
Qiqi is the head of the spies

952
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,670
of the Secret Force.

953
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,080
It won’t be a problem for her.

954
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:01,630
Your Majesty!

955
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,360
I have made up my mind.
Your workload is heavy,

956
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,360
so you don’t need to be involved

957
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,840
in the renewal of the spy network.

958
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Go transfer your work over to Miss Ju.
