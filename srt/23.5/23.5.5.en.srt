1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Astrological fortune-telling.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,880
A fortune-telling activity
held by our Astronomy Club.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,280
You two will be our fortune tellers
on Club Fair Day.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,639
-For our Astronomy Club, keep fighting.
-Where are you going?

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,959
-Fighting.
-"Borrowing power from the stars

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,479
to foretell someone's fortune

7
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,000
requires you to sell the power
of your own soul."

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,560
Let's say I like someone.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,520
How likely is it that the person
will reciprocate my feelings?

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,520
Very likely.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,400
That person must like you very much.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,600
A universe that needs
no prophecy from the stars.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,320
A universe where
you already know how you feel.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Are these for me?

15
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,519
Sun.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,400
I…

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,400
I don't know.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,480
The delivery guy left them with me.

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,199
Yeah?

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,440
Thank you.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,399
Sure. You're welcome.

22
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:13,920
In the end, I chickened out.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,360
I need to get back to the club.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,119
I haven't grabbed my stuff yet.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,600
Bye.

26
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,399
Did you send me flowers?

27
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,559
How did you do it?

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,080
Yes, I did.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,360
Do you like them?

30
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,679
Well…

31
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,919
I do.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,119
That's great.

33
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,039
That you like them.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,639
That makes me happy.

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,320
It's true that the Sun should be
with the Earth,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,720
not with you, Ongsa.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
Alien, please let us join your club.

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
We love your club so much.

39
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:10,480
It's true. Please recruit us, Alien.

40
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,679
Talk to the club leader.

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,040
Come on. Can't you talk to her for us?

42
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,479
Please.

43
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,240
Speak with us.

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,360
Say something.

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,479
Please.

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
I might have made history
by defeating Ton's club.

47
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,159
Luna? What are those girls doing
at your club?

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,840
Please accept us, Alien.

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,000
Alien, will you talk to her for us?

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,400
Please.

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,520
Where are you going?

52
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,479
Guys, stop it right now.

53
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Why are you cornering her like that?

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,200
If you want to switch clubs,
wait until next semester.

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
Apply again next semester, guys.

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,479
Aylin, are you okay?

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Alien has no reason to talk to humans.

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,039
Aylin.

59
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,520
Aylin, wait.

60
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,520
Sun, you've known Aylin
since junior high, right?

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Yes.

62
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,560
I've known her since Grade 7,

63
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,360
but we weren't close then.

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,680
Has she always been like this?

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,080
What do you mean, Alpha?

66
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,599
Well, she has no friends,

67
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,919
she doesn't talk to people,

68
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,039
she doesn't care about anyone,

69
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:31,919
and

70
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:35,960
she's been nicknamed "Alien."

71
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
Aylin is different from other people.

72
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,039
She's quiet.

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,120
She doesn't talk much to people.

74
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,960
She's interested in space,
UFOs, and alien stuff.

75
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,120
Her classmates thought she was strange

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and started calling her Alien.

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,080
After that, she distanced herself
from people even more.

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,159
Hearing that makes me feel guilty.

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,000
I knew she was obsessed with aliens,

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,120
I just didn't know that it had caused
social problems like that for her.

81
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Aylin is my cousin,
but I can't help her with anything.

82
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Come on now.

83
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,919
At least you know her problem now.

84
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,799
Let's find a way to help her.

85
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,799
We don't know what Aylin's been through
like you do,

86
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:49,240
but we really want to help her.

87
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,560
From now on, if you see her struggling
with any kind of problem,

88
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
can you let us know?

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,400
Of course.

90
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
Aylin is my friend too.

91
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll let you know if I notice anything.

92
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,200
Thank you so much, Sun.

93
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Why are you smiling? Can I see?

94
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,479
It's nothing.

95
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,039
Every time you say that, it's something.

96
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,919
It really is nothing.

97
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
Keep on working.

98
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,840
Hey. Your birthday is coming up.

99
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,039
What will you do this year?

100
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,640
Planning to meet up with someone?

101
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,880
Meet up?

102
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,239
I'm not.

103
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,799
We thought you'd be going on a date
with Mr. Earth or something.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
What date?

105
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
There's no meeting.

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,479
No date.

107
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,239
No nothing.

108
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
Earth and I are just friends.

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,039
Girl, this is not what friends do.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
Friends don't make you smile like that.

111
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,640
So, have you ever seen his face?

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,159
I haven't.

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
I think it's weird.

114
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,560
-He could be a crim.
-A criminal?

115
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,599
What?

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,000
No way.

117
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,840
I've just never asked for his photo.

118
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.

119
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,480
But you might want to.

120
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,319
You've been talking for a while now.

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,120
Don't you want to see each other's faces?

122
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Earth has never made me feel uneasy

123
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,319
and I don't want him
to feel uneasy either.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,800
If he wants to show his face,
he eventually will.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
How about this?

126
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,040
I have a way to find out
if this guy Earth is serious with you.

127
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
A way?

128
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
What way?

129
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,920
Your birthday. Invite him to come.

130
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,600
It describes how often something happens
in the simple present tense.

131
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
Give me some examples.

132
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,760
There are more. What adverbs do we use
if something doesn't happen very often?

133
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,400
It's my birthday in a few days.

134
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,360
If I ask you a favor, will you grant it?

135
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
What is it?

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Can we meet up?

137
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,520
Sit back down.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
"Never" in the present simple tense

139
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,520
means "not ever,"
as in a habit that is always negative.

140
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
But "never" in the present perfect tense

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,959
implies "not ever," as in,
"You haven't done it."

142
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,760
I want to go.

143
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
But no promises.

144
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,760
I know you live far away.

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
But if you can, I'd love you to come.

146
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,079
If someone says, "I have never loved you,"
what do they mean, Tinh?

147
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
They mean they don't love you,
not because they never had the chance to,

148
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
but because they never did
in the first place.

149
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,880
Ouch.

150
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
That hurts.

151
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Correct.

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,319
You can tell by the adverb of frequency
that's used in the sentence.

153
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,199
It indicates how often something happens.

154
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,120
Guys, are you free this Saturday?

155
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,240
We are.

156
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,640
Why do you ask, Sun?

157
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,680
I'm throwing a birthday party
this Saturday.

158
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,400
That's why.

159
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
Do you have time?

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,560
-We do.
-We do.

161
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,560
What about you, Ongsa? Are you free?

162
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,719
I am. I'll be there.

163
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,439
Great. Please tell Aylin
she's invited as well.

164
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,319
Thanks a lot for inviting us.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll be going now.

166
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,280
-Bye.
-See you.

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,079
Come on.

168
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
Aylin.

169
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
What, human?

170
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,000
Sun has invited us
to her birthday party this Saturday.

171
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,839
You're invited too, Alien.

172
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,800
Right. She asked us to ask you.

173
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:02,480
I never thought someone like Sun
would invite people like us.

174
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,439
I thought she would only
invite you, Ongsa.

175
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,719
Why are you looking at me like that?

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,040
We saw it.

177
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,439
You gave Sun the flowers.

178
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,600
Me?

179
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,160
No way.

180
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,439
Don't lie.

181
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,280
We saw with our own eyes
that you visited the Floral Design Club,

182
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,120
got the bouquet, and gave it to Sun.

183
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,240
You're wrong.

184
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,839
You saw it wrong.

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I didn't. You want proof?

186
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,640
Wanna see it?

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Fine.

188
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:46,240
I gave Sun the flowers.

189
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,880
But…

190
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,079
Sun doesn't know they're from me.

191
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,599
What?

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
Well…

193
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,560
Here's the story.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,280
What? Sun thinks you're a guy?

195
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,240
I didn't think it was a big deal at first.

196
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,439
I didn't know it would escalate.

197
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,400
I think you'd better tell her soon
that you're Earth.

198
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,599
I'm scared.

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm afraid that if she learns the truth,

200
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I will…

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,079
I will…

202
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,160
But keeping on lying is a sin.

203
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,400
But I have no clue what to do.

204
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,800
What do we do?

205
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,000
Are you waiting for global warming
to strike first?

206
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,319
Humans always blame it on other things

207
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,280
when they're the ones responsible
for global warming.

208
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Keep lying, and one day,
you might drift away from her orbit.

209
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,319
Latte,

210
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,599
do you think she'll still want
to be my friend

211
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,120
if she knows I'm Earth?

212
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,000
What should I get Sun for her birthday?

213
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,520
Should we chip in
and buy something for her?

214
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,120
Can I chip in too?

215
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,599
No.

216
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,760
Why not?

217
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,839
Ongsa, "Attā hi attanō nāthō."

218
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,040
Oneself is a refuge of oneself.

219
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,760
You must find the present yourself.

220
00:14:58,839 --> 00:14:59,880
That's right.

221
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,120
A gift for someone you like must be
more special than other people's gifts.

222
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,640
Special how?

223
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,319
It should be something meaningful
and have sentimental value.

224
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,439
Sentimental value?

225
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,319
I was up all night thinking about
what gift to get Sun.

226
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,839
A meaningful gift.

227
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,199
A meaningful gift.

228
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,520
What gift would be suitable
for someone like Sun?

229
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,199
There's none unless you box up the Sun
and give it to her, Ongsa.

230
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Hello?

231
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,359
Student?

232
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:10,760
Uh, can I get a box of Kanom Sun, please?

233
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,079
What?

234
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,280
A box of Kanom Sun.

235
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,199
Kanom Sun?

236
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,880
Oops! I mean a box of Kanom Krok, please.

237
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,719
Did you just say
a box of Kanom Sun, Ongsa?

239
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:29,959
I…

240
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,479
Why would you say that?

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,599
Were you thinking of me?

242
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,719
Well,

243
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,599
I was thinking of
what I should get you for your birthday.

244
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,520
Is there anything you want?

245
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,199
No.

246
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,079
Nothing at all?

247
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,159
For me, spending time
with someone special is enough.

248
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,839
Someone special?

249
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,119
My family, my friends,

250
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,119
and you, Ongsa.

251
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,639
You must come, all right?

252
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,639
So…

253
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,879
what about Earth?

254
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
I invited him too.

255
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
He's also special to me.

256
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,159
ALIENS AND UFOS

257
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
That's Alien.

258
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,560
Over there?

259
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,000
-Are you about to finish?
-I am.

260
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,480
Give her this.

261
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,720
Go on.

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,280
Alien, someone asked me to give you this.

263
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,399
AYLIN = ALIEN

264
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
She's in shock.

265
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,040
Alien is angry now. That's new.

266
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,680
-We'd better bounce.
-Let's go.

267
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,600
Alien, can you return
these books to their shelves?

268
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,399
We don't know how to arrange them.

269
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,960
What are you guys doing?

270
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,919
You're too old to be this childish.

271
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,520
You think it's cool
to harass other people?

272
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,040
Huh? You think you're so cool?

273
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
What a loser. I'm gonna punch…

274
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,960
Human senior, stop.

275
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,480
It's the library. Keep your voice down.

276
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,760
Why should I?

277
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
Everyone should know

278
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,280
that this bunch of youngsters
think they're so cool

279
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,679
that they can mock and harass
other people.

280
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,879
Just because she doesn't respond
doesn't mean you can do that.

281
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,800
Never let me catch you doing this again

282
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,679
or you'll be talked about all over S-Tar.

283
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,080
We're sorry, Alien.

284
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,720
-What did you say?!
-We're sorry, Aylin.

285
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,919
Why were you being so loud?

286
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,840
Those guys were harassing you.
I saw it and yelled at them.

287
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,320
-It was the right thing to do, yeah?
-Next time, don't.

288
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:22,280
Humans can't harm aliens.

289
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,159
It isn't something you should put up with.

290
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,960
You're not a joke.

291
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,760
You're not causing trouble to anyone,
so don't let anyone cause you trouble.

292
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't put up with them.

293
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,600
I just don't care.

294
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,399
Okay. How about this?

295
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,879
If you don't care,
then I'll be the one that does.

296
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
We're friends after all, right?

297
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,120
Don't you remember?

298
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,399
Here.

299
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,960
You know there are lots of holes
on the moon's surface, right?

300
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,159
Maybe, they are shelters
for aliens to hide from danger.

301
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,480
-Aylin.
-Human.

302
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
You go first, human.

303
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
It's fine.

304
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,040
You go first, Aylin.

305
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
No. You first.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know what to do
with the Sun situation.

307
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
She has such high hopes about Earth.

308
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,399
I still don't know if I should attend
her birthday party

309
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,720
as Ongsa or Earth.

310
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,399
But whatever I choose,

311
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,399
I'm going to let her down.

312
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,720
It's a choice
you have to make yourself, human.

313
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,960
But I don't know what to choose, Aylin.

314
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,200
If your brain can't think,

315
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,120
let your heart think.

316
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Human.

317
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,040
Do you think aliens have hearts?

318
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,399
Can aliens fall in love like humans do?

319
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:20,879
How are human hearts different
from alien hearts?

320
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
Human hearts have limits.

321
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,800
That's why they get emotional so easily.
Their hearts are weak.

322
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah. That's true.

323
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
My heart is weak right now, Aylin.

324
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,439
Can I get a box of Kanom Sun, please?

325
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,000
What? Kanom Sun?

326
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:10,760
Oops! I mean a box of Kanom Krok!

327
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,399
Sorry, it came out wrong.

328
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,080
Did you just say
a box of Kanom Sun, Ongsa?

329
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,000
Why would you say that?

330
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Were you thinking of me?

331
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,320
Well…

332
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
Kanom Krok-Sun?

333
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,360
SSSUNSHINE SENT YOU A PHOTO

334
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,879
Kanom Krok-Sun.

335
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,879
Crap!

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
What is it, human?

337
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,360
Sun.

338
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,320
Sun sent me a message.

339
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,320
So?

340
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
She sent the message to me, not Earth.

341
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:24,600
Aylin.

342
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,840
She's so cute eating her snack.

343
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,399
Who on earth looks this cute
when eating snacks?

344
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,240
Cute, huh?

345
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,439
Get it together, human.

346
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,399
Aren't you gonna reply?

347
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,800
Right.

348
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
ONGSA SENT YOU A MESSAGE

349
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,200
Looks yummy.

350
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,919
I invited Aylin on your behalf.

351
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,439
Thank you, Ongsa.

352
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,040
Aylin, Sun replied to my messages.

353
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,520
How cute.

354
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,439
She's so cute, I can't.

355
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,800
It's the first time
Sun's ever reached out to me.

356
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,960
Hey! Don't go yet, Aylin.

357
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,080
Hold on.

358
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
Hey!

359
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:00,000
How can someone be so lovely?

360
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
She's just the cutest.

361
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,439
I KNOW YOU LIVE FAR AWAY…

362
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,399
If you can't come
to my birthday party, it's okay.

363
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,439
I know you live far away.

364
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
Traveling to Bangkok might be troublesome.

365
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,000
I understand.

366
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,280
I'm sorry, Sun.

367
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,320
See you, Sun.

368
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,520
I still can't decide whether the one
who will give her this gift

369
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,879
will be Earth or Ongsa,

370
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,360
but I'll try my best to make it.

371
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,399
Hand out the plates.

372
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,560
-Oh.
-Hold on.

373
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,199
Sun.

374
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
Sun, like the Sun,

375
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,919
is burning you once again, Ongsa.

376
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,720
All the worries
I've been carrying for days

377
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,720
are chased away by Sun's smile.

378
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,199
How can someone be this lovely?

379
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Come on in.

380
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,679
Thank you for coming, guys.

381
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,399
-No. Thank you for inviting us.
-Right.

382
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:31,000
H-B-D.

383
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:34,480
Thank you, Aylin.

384
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,000
This is from me.

385
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,399
Thank you, Tinh.

386
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,560
Happy birthday, Sun.

387
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:42,120
This gift was enchanted by
Luangpu Sek himself.

388
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,000
May Buddha be with you.

389
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,159
Sadhu.

390
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,800
Let's have some snacks.

391
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:52,000
We have a lot.

392
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
Have a seat.

393
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,439
Vi, do you want this too?

394
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,040
-I want the one at the bottom.
-This?

395
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,760
-You want a refill, Tinh?
-No.

396
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,240
Sun, is Mr. Earth coming?

397
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,159
He said he was.

398
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
Did he say what time?

399
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,600
We want to see your Earth so bad.

400
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,040
Shut up. He isn't my Earth.

401
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,320
Look at you.

402
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:30,120
Your cheeks are red.

403
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,159
Stop it. No more teasing.

404
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,639
I want to know how he does it.

405
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,800
Sun is head over heels for him.

406
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,199
He must be hot.

407
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:43,080
Do you think he's hot, Sun?

408
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,879
Enough. You want some drinks?

409
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,520
Changing the subject, I see.

410
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
-Sun is blushing.
-No teasing.

411
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,199
Don't.

412
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,720
It's tough, human.

413
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,720
But you must keep going.

414
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
How's the orange juice?

415
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,080
Earth, where are you?

416
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,120
Can you find the way here okay?

417
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:41,840
Sun.

418
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,520
What's up, Ongsa?

419
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,280
Are you…

420
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,560
waiting for Earth?

421
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
I'm afraid he might get lost.

422
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,320
What if…

423
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,800
he doesn't come?

424
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,600
I would be sad, I guess.

425
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
But no.

426
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,199
I think he's coming.

427
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,080
He told me he would.

428
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,919
Sun…

429
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,719
I have something to tell you.

430
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,919
What is it?

431
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,439
I…

432
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,240
I…

433
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,679
Yeah!

434
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,439
Thank you, guys.

435
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,120
Let's eat the cake.

436
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,600
Should we bring it outside?

437
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,000
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

438
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,800
Aylin, come on.

439
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,480
-Yum!
-The cake is so good.

440
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,399
Have you tried this?

441
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,080
Eat some fruit too.

442
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,440
Sun.

443
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,199
Are you okay?

444
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
What do you mean?

445
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,120
About Earth.

446
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,319
It's late. He hasn't shown up yet.

447
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,199
What did he say?

448
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,920
He read

449
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:30,799
but didn't reply.

450
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,080
I don't think it's gonna work.

451
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,319
It's your birthday, for goodness' sake.
Your special day.

452
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,520
That guy can't do this to you.

453
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Right. Why the heck didn't he reply?

454
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,279
If he wasn't going to come,
why didn't he say so?

455
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,080
He shouldn't have led you on like this.

456
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,679
He might have his reasons.

457
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,480
Don't you take his side.

458
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,520
Your relationship status is vague.

459
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,680
You haven't seen his face.
There's never been one phone call.

460
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:01,160
Guys, stop it.

461
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,600
It's Sun's birthday.

462
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,600
I've made up my mind.

463
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,520
I'll give Earth one last chance.

464
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,160
I'll ask him to meet me this evening

465
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,920
and we'll go from there.

466
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,319
If he doesn't show up,

467
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,920
I'll stop talking to him.

468
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,200
I'm waiting for you right here.

469
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:52,440
What should I do, Latte?

470
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,120
You all right, human?

471
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,600
I don't know what to do.

472
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,920
If I go see her and tell her I'm Earth,

473
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,720
she'll be disappointed that
I'm not a guy like she thought I was,

474
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,240
but if I don't go,

475
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,600
she will be sad
because Earth broke his promise.

476
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,440
I know for sure
she will be broken-hearted.

477
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
She might cry.

478
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,520
I don't want her to cry on her birthday.

479
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,400
But I'm scared.

480
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,640
Do you really like Sun, human?

481
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,000
If you do, you have to make it right.

482
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,520
Otherwise…

483
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,680
you might drift away from her orbit.

484
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,200
But I still want Sun in my life.

485
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
Human hearts have limits.

486
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,440
That's why they get emotional so easily.

487
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:56,520
Humans get angry,

488
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,120
but they'll come around eventually
if you don't quit trying.

489
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,920
Human hearts have limits.

490
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,560
That's why they get emotional so easily.

491
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,799
Humans get angry,

492
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:12,600
but they'll come around eventually
if you don't quit trying.

493
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,359
Hey, Ongsa.

494
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,240
What are you doing here?

495
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,520
I came to see you.

496
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,960
Are you worried about me?

497
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,359
Thank you, Ongsa.

498
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,640
It's good to have company while waiting.

499
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,680
You know,

500
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,319
I've never thought birthdays
were that big a deal.

501
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,120
I always felt like
they were just another ordinary day.

502
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,200
Nothing special.

503
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,400
But once I knew Earth was coming,

504
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,080
my birthday suddenly became special.

505
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,359
It might be silly

506
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,400
to wait for someone I haven't even met.

507
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,799
Someone who reads my messages
but doesn't reply.

508
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,600
But do you know what's sillier?

509
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:45,480
Deep down, I still believe…

510
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,600
Earth will come to see me

511
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,200
because the Earth I know,

512
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,839
the one I talk to every day,

513
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,400
would never let me down on my birthday.

514
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,799
It's good you're here, Ongsa.

515
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,920
I think you and Earth
can become good friends.

516
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,960
I'm selfish.

517
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,839
I'm cowardly and hesitant.

518
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,720
But I really can't, Aylin.

519
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,000
I really can't ruin Sun's birthday.

520
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,080
Earth, the one Sun has faith in…

521
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:39,040
I really can't tell her
that he doesn't exist.

522
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,720
Sun, we've been waiting a while.

523
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,000
Should we go?

524
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,040
Let's go, Sun.

525
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,359
Sun.

526
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,920
You can leave me here, Ongsa.

527
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,920
But I don't think Earth will come.

528
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
I want to be alone.

529
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,720
Please give me some alone time.

530
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,920
Earth, you really can't come?

531
00:45:18,879 --> 00:45:22,759
You can just tell me honestly.
I won't be mad.

532
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,600
Just don't disappear like this.

533
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,960
Did something happen?

534
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,520
Though she's been hurt,

535
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,720
she still trusts

536
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,160
and has faith in Earth.

537
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,440
Sun!

538
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,520
I know you're upset,

539
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,799
but there must be a reason
why Earth can't come.

540
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,240
Please don't cry.

541
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,040
Let's wipe your tears.

542
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,440
Thank you.

543
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,720
Sun, please don't cry.

544
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,359
Excuse me.

545
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,319
Which one of you is Miss Sun?

546
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,839
I've got a package for you.

547
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,120
It's me.

548
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,560
Here you go.

549
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,799
Who sent this?

550
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,720
The sender's name is Earth.
It was sent from Phuket.

551
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,400
All right then. Please excuse me.

552
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,600
Why don't you open it, Sun?

553
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:22,920
I'm sorry I couldn't go see you,

554
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,520
but I've sent you all the planets
in the universe instead, Sun.

555
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:30,960
Happy birthday.

556
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,120
Ongsa!

557
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,000
Earth sent me a present!

558
00:49:58,799 --> 00:49:59,920
You should put it on.

559
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,319
Let me hold this.

560
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,920
Thank you.

561
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,799
Happy birthday, my Sun.

562
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,399
And…

563
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,319
sorry.

564
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,600
Ongsa, look.

565
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:30,520
I've got the whole universe.

566
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,440
There's the Sun at the center.

567
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,040
Pretty?

568
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,960
-He isn't being honest with Sun.
-I trust Earth.

569
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,440
Even though we've never met,
I feel like he's always by my side.

570
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,799
Didn't Aylin tell you that your friends
would be sleeping over tonight?

571
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:18,240
This is your chance to tell Sun
that you're Earth.

572
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,319
If it turns out he isn't who you think
he is, will you be able to take it?

573
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,279
@S_SSUNSHINE: MORNING

574
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,520
Ongsa, are you Earth?
