1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Alien, please let us join your club.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,720
Guys, stop it right now.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,720
Why are you cornering her like that?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,840
Has she always been like this?

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,840
Aylin is interested in space.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,840
Her classmates thought she was strange

8
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,040
and started calling her Alien.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,160
Your birthday is coming up.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,360
What will you do this year?

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,959
Planning to meet up with someone?

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,200
Meet up?

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,759
I'm not.

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,959
Invite him to come.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,199
It's my birthday in a few days.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,640
Can we meet up?

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,360
What?

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,879
I don't think it's gonna work.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,120
It's your birthday, for goodness' sake.
That guy can't do this to you.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
I've made up my mind.

21
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:48,879
I'll give Earth one last chance.

22
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,480
I'll ask him to meet me this evening.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,120
Ongsa!

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,839
Earth sent me a present.

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,199
Happy birthday, my Sun.

26
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,800
And sorry.

27
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,240
Pretty?

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,119
Ongsa,

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,200
you've been stressed out lately.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
Is there a problem?

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Alpha, does your sister have
a problem in school?

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
I'm just tired.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
The mid-term exams are approaching.

34
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,440
Let me know if you need help studying.

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,839
It's okay, Alpha.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,520
I can manage.

37
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,240
Will you excuse me?

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
I need to go study.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,600
Are you full?

40
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,479
You ate so little.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
There's plenty of food left.

42
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,079
I'm full.

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,519
Excuse me.

44
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,160
Aylin,

45
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,760
will you go talk to her?

46
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,320
She might be willing
to listen to an alien.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,519
In exchange for a veggie-free meal.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,799
Human, your door is locked.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
Are you hiding something?

50
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,679
Aylin, please leave me alone.

51
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,760
Is it because of the Sun?

52
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:27,920
Human, if you don't tell the truth,

53
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
you're going to keep suffering.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,560
If the Sun finds out,

55
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,840
the Earth will come to an end.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,519
Soon…

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,200
the Earth will surely come to an end.

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,400
It was my birthday gift from Earth.

59
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,599
Cute, right?

60
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,479
Very cute. He has good taste.

61
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,960
But he didn't show up.

62
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,360
Why so mysterious?

63
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,640
It's like he just wants to
keep Sun a secret.

64
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:46,200
Dear, don't kill the vibe.
Your friend is in love.

65
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,159
Whatever. He didn't show up
when he promised he would.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,719
He isn't being honest with Sun for sure.

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Earth must have his reasons.

68
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,000
Reasons? More like excuses.

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm saying this
because I'm concerned about you, Sun.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,200
Don't overthink it, Dear.

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
Earth isn't a bad person.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,919
See? You're so nice.

73
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
Someone so nice
shouldn't be with such a fickle guy.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,800
Step back before you get hurt.

75
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,919
But

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,400
I trust Earth.

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,320
I have no idea why.

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,240
Even though we've never met,

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,479
I feel like he's always by my side.

80
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,800
I guess I like him very much.

81
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:43,919
I'm sorry, Sun.

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
Sorry.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm such a terrible person.

84
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,400
Do you know that guys
can wear makeup in everyday life too?

85
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,640
Because cosmetics aren't gender-specific.

86
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,640
And today, I'm teaching you all
how to put on a natural look.

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,919
I'm telling you…

88
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,320
Cute, huh?

89
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,799
The longer I look,
the more cuteness I see.

90
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,440
Right.

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,799
Hey, Ton.

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
You were ogling them with heart eyes.

93
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,799
What are you talking about? No way.

94
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,320
-Hey.
-What?

95
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,840
Let's talk first.

96
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,599
You've got a crush, right?

97
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,200
No.

98
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,120
Handsome, listen.

99
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,799
Love is good.

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,760
A Dhamma-loving, optimistic,

101
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,200
and self-assured girl like Charoen

102
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,479
is perfect for you.

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,080
I don't like Charoen.

104
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,400
Mawin, Charoen is gentle and sweet.

105
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,479
She also loves Dhamma.

106
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,479
-Seriously, she isn't the one I like.
-She's sweet.

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,239
Mawin, you can just tell me.

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,919
Look.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Isn't she so cute talking to her friend?

110
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,880
I like Tinh, not Charoen.

111
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,480
Right. Because Tinh is nice
and Dhamma-loving…

112
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,400
What?

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,560
I like Tinh, not Charoen.

114
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
You got it?

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,160
I like T…

116
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:52,840
Shit! Why am I telling you this?

117
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,520
Dammit.

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,199
How was I so wrong?

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,319
It's a lip balm. Focus on my lips.
That's where you should focus.

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,520
Okay. Let me zoom in.

121
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,560
That's too close.
I won't be able to use that.

122
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Then don't.

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,520
-I'm gonna cut it out.
-Wow, Charoen.

124
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,400
Does nobody like you at all?

125
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,280
This is…

126
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,280
Space junk.

127
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
It isn't junk, student.

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,160
It's a treasure.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,120
I know it looks kind of rusty.

130
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:51,800
That's why I want you guys to renovate it

131
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,600
so it can be our club's decoration

132
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,240
and a legacy for your junior members.

133
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:58,560
Sound good?

134
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

135
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
Ongsa?

136
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,560
Did you hear what I said?

137
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,760
She's spaced out.

138
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,199
Ongsa…

139
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,640
Has Sun found out?

140
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,600
Are you okay?

141
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:39,720
I need to poop. May I take a toilet break?

143
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,439
What's going on with Ongsa?

144
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,600
I'll leave this with you.

145
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,800
Sun, can you help me
find a spaceship model?

146
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
Of course, ma'am.

147
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,120
Human senior.

148
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,280
What?

149
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,319
Your face tells me you need help.

150
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,240
You're a living thing with wisdom.

151
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,360
Cut to the point.

152
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,319
What do you do to make humans confess?

153
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Confess?

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,880
What do you mean?

155
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,920
Ongsa and Sun.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
What?

157
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,280
What's going on with Ongsa and Sun?

158
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,880
It's a long and complicated story.

159
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,319
Fill me in.

160
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,319
STUDENT COMMITTEE

161
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,319
Hey, Mawin.

162
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,959
No one is helping you clean up?

163
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,000
But I can handle it by myself.

164
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,319
In that case, let me help.

165
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,839
No, it's fine.

166
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,959
I can manage.

167
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,880
You can?

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,880
But you're the only one here.

169
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,760
I don't think so. Come on, let me help.

170
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,480
It's nothing.
I just accidentally flicked it.

171
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,520
You sure you're okay?

172
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,560
I am.

173
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,079
I read somewhere that an asteroid

174
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,719
will hit Earth in the next 23 years.

175
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,240
Can it just happen in 23 minutes?

176
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,520
I can't bear it anymore.

177
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:25,760
Ongsa, have you fed Latte?

178
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,800
I have, Mom.

179
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,880
Please, come in.

180
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,079
The door isn't locked. Come on in.

181
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Ongsa, your friends are here.

182
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
What?

183
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,480
Didn't Aylin tell you that your friends
would be sleeping over tonight?

184
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,040
Yes. A human friend and a human senior
will spend the night.

185
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,560
What?

186
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,319
Hot outside?

187
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,319
Hello, ma'am.

188
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,319
Hello, there.

189
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,480
Hi, Ongsa.

190
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
Is this what they call the apocalypse?

191
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,959
Please, come in.

192
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,240
Come.

193
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,079
Aylin, why is Sun here?

194
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
To work on the club's project. That's why
she's spending the night, human.

195
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
When did you guys arrange this sleepover?

196
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,599
We talked at the club
after we were given the assignment.

197
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,599
Why didn't I know about it?

198
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,839
You were spaced out
and then you went to poop.

199
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,560
Human.

200
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,000
This is your chance to tell Sun

201
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,479
that you're Earth.

202
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,000
I have no clue how to tell her, Aylin.

203
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,079
Don't worry.

204
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,959
Alien and the human senior will help.

205
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:47,560
Hey. I heard you're talking
to someone, Sun.

206
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,680
Who told you the gossip?

207
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Was it you, Ongsa?

208
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,959
No.

209
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,199
I never said anything.

210
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, please. You're a popular girl.

211
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,040
I bet everyone in school knows your story.

212
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,160
Is it the guy named Earth?

213
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,040
The one you're talking to online
but haven't met.

214
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,599
Yes.

215
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,400
We met on Insta.

216
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:19,240
He's funny.

217
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,800
After talking for a while,

218
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,359
I fell in love with him.

219
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,680
Have you ever talked on the phone?

220
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,719
We haven't.

221
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,920
That's because

222
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,000
Earth is more comfortable messaging.

223
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,640
Honestly, I am too

224
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,839
so I don't mind.

225
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,199
Don't you wonder

226
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,000
why he refuses to call
or send you pictures of himself?

227
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:57,359
Only messaging
is somewhat suspicious to me.

228
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,879
I know that everyone is concerned
for me about Earth,

229
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,240
but the Earth I know isn't a bad guy.

230
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
I trust him.

231
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,879
I believe he has his reasons.

232
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,720
And if one day you meet him

233
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:28,200
and it turns out he isn't
what you imagine him to be,

234
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:30,600
will you be able to take it?

235
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
I think so

236
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
because I like who he is inside.

237
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
No matter what he looks like,
my feelings will not change.

238
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
This is your chance, human.

239
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,440
Sun, it's…

240
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,520
Yes, Ongsa?

241
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,399
I…

242
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,320
Why are you acting like that?

243
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,520
Don't smile like that.

244
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,960
It's because you're acting funny.

245
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,919
Whenever you smile,

246
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I just don't know what to do with myself.

247
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,120
So, what is it?

248
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:51,360
Well…

249
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,120
I…

250
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,000
It's…

251
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,919
I…

252
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,040
I…

253
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,399
I need to use the scissors.

254
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,320
Of course.

255
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,879
You were supposed to tell the truth,

256
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,760
not ask her to pass the scissors, human.

257
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,120
So, where should I and Sun crash?

259
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,720
I can sleep in the living room.

260
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,639
No, you can't.

261
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,159
You should sleep in a bedroom.

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Human senior, you sleep in Alpha's room.

263
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,240
Human friend, you sleep in Ongsa's room.

264
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,520
Right. I will sleep in Aylin's.

265
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,560
-You're not allowed in my room, human.
-Why not?

266
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:18,440
I want Sun to have some privacy
and to feel comfortable.

267
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,560
You can take my room, Sun.

268
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,399
You don't have to give up
your room, Ongsa.

269
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,520
I do! I'm scared.

270
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,840
I toss and turn and there's also Latte.

271
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,720
You won't get a good sleep.

272
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,560
It's fine. I will.

273
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,080
Okay, okay. Don't argue.

274
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,200
Let's do this.

275
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,040
I will share Aylin's room.

276
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
Sun will share Ongsa's room.

277
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,200
Why would you do that?
Why don't you go to Alpha's room?

278
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,000
Because Alpha studies late.

279
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,200
I don't want to bother her.

280
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,919
Don't come into my room.

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,919
You guys find a solution yourselves.
My room isn't an option.

282
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,120
See? Come on.

283
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,440
Is this your room?

284
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,240
-No, human senior.
-Come in. Get in.

285
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,200
Don't you see the sign? No humans allowed!

286
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,040
Then, may I share your room tonight?

287
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Is it that one?

288
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,200
Yes.

289
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,600
Wow. This is so cool.

290
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
You can't look, human senior.

291
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,679
What? Why not?

292
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,240
It isn't something you must know.

293
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,480
Come on.

294
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,960
Don't be stingy. Learn to share, will you?

295
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
We're in the same club after all.

296
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,159
Be generous.

297
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Why are you so stubborn?

298
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't want you to see.

299
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,040
What are you doing?

300
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
You don't want me to see.

301
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,720
Why are you doing this, human?

302
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,200
What you like
and take an interest in is cool.

303
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,919
There's no reason
to be embarrassed about it.

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,399
You should even be proud.

305
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,280
One day, you'll find someone
who shares the same interest.

306
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,399
Like now.

307
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,600
I also like what you like.

308
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,240
This is new.

309
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,960
What is?

310
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,800
A human being liking what I like.

311
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,399
I told you, I'm not human.

312
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm a moon.

313
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,080
Can I observe now?

314
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
There are more over there.

315
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:45,879
What's the name of that one?

316
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,000
"Friend."

317
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,200
Is it stubborn like this one?

318
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
Aliens aren't stubborn.

319
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,720
Then why is this alien stubborn?

320
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
Sun, you take the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

321
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:34,240
Ongsa, you're the host.

322
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
Why would you sleep on the floor?
Sleep on the bed.

323
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,960
It's fine. I'll sleep on the floor.

324
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,560
You sleep on the bed, Sun.

325
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,520
I'll be mad if you sleep on the floor.

326
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,800
Why would you be mad?

327
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,320
You want me to get mad?

328
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,800
When I'm mad, I can be quite frightening.

329
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:20,639
Okay.

330
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
I'll sleep on the bed.

331
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,480
You're a good girl, Ongsa.

332
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,600
Come. Let's get some sleep.

333
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,320
Come on.

334
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:58,919
Come to bed.

335
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,720
Thank you.

336
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Good night, Ongsa.

337
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,199
Good night, Sun.

338
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,840
It's beautiful.

339
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,520
I like it.

340
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,280
Sun.

341
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:55,720
I…

342
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
have something to tell you.

343
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,800
It's about Earth.

344
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,720
What about Earth?

345
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:14,960
Well…

346
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,840
I…

347
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,800
Is there something on your mind?

348
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,679
Seems like you've been
wanting to say something.

349
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,879
I want to tell you that…

350
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,800
Thank you for being my friend.

351
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:47,639
I'm glad to be friends with you, Ongsa.

352
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:52,040
Aw, I didn't think
this was what you'd say.

353
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,360
Actually, there's one more thing.

354
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,399
Yes?

355
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,280
What is it?

356
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,520
You're so cute when you smile.

357
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:13,639
I like your smile.

358
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,120
Please.

359
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:17,919
This is it?

360
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
You're making me blush.

361
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:25,199
I might never stop smiling

362
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,120
and you'll get sick of it.

363
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,240
I could look at your smile all day.

364
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,919
You're exaggerating.

365
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,240
I don't believe you.

366
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,399
Let's get some sleep, Ongsa.

367
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
I'm sleepy.

368
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,199
I'm sorry, Sun.

369
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,199
I still want to see your smile.

370
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,840
Sorry for being selfish.

371
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,480
Are you up yet?

372
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,199
I guess not.

373
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,679
You must have been too busy
to reply to me yesterday.

374
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,040
It's okay.

375
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,520
I understand.

376
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,800
Have a good day today, Earth.

377
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,439
Sun, you're awake?

378
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,959
Ongsa,

379
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,959
are you Earth?

380
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,320
Why did all the messages I sent to Earth

381
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:08,520
appear on your phone?

382
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Sun!

383
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm sorry.

384
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,120
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,520
Actually, I am…

386
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,480
Earth.

387
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm sorry for covering this up.

388
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,279
-That…
-Then what was it that we had?

389
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,360
Am I a joke to you?

390
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,880
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,920
Sun, I'm sorry.

392
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,799
I have no excuses.

393
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm really sorry.

394
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,560
Stop apologizing!

395
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,120
You know

396
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,319
how I feel toward Earth.

397
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,520
Explain it to me.

398
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,040
Why did you do this to me?

399
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:23,720
Sun, I'm sorry.

400
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,720
I'm sorry.

401
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
-I didn't mean to. I'm sorry…
-Stop saying you're sorry.

402
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,799
Just explain what this is.

403
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm sorry.

404
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,440
I don't know what it will be like,
the day the Earth ends,

405
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,600
but I think it will feel
something like this.

406
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,319
The world without the Sun
isn't livable, Ongsa.

407
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,160
Ongsa, Sun, are you guys up yet?

408
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,920
Humans, wake up.

409
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm hungry.

410
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Where are they?

411
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,640
Aylin, I already left.

412
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,279
I found out that Ongsa is Earth.

413
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:38,480
Human Sun knows about Earth.

414
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,920
What?

415
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,240
Where is Ongsa?

416
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,400
How should I know?

417
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,279
Gosh.

418
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,279
Let me call her.

419
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:52,359
The number you've dialed
cannot be connected…

420
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,120
Her phone is off.

421
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,400
That human being
caused trouble again, didn't she?

422
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,160
Let's go find her. Come on.

423
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,839
Come on.

424
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,000
How should I feel about you, Ongsa?

425
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,200
Human.

426
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,040
Human.

427
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,359
Ongsa.

428
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,160
Ongsa.

429
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,160
GROCERY STORE

430
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,040
Human.

431
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
Human.

432
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,120
Ongsa.

433
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,839
Human senior.

434
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,279
Found her?

435
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
No.

436
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,319
She must have fled the Earth.

437
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,000
Then I guess we must tell her family.

438
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,720
Human cousin.

439
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,720
It's human Ongsa.

440
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:42,720
She…

441
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,759
Ongsa!

442
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:45,880
-Do you hear me?
-Where are you?

443
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,440
Ongsa.

444
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,319
-Human.
-Ongsa!

445
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,520
Ongsa.

446
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,240
Ongsa, are you here?

447
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,160
Ongsa, where are you?

448
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,880
-Ongsa, baby.
-Ongsa!

449
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,480
Mom, Dad, this way.

450
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,600
Where is she?

451
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,839
-Ongsa.
-Ongsa.

452
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,880
Ongsa.

453
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,319
-Ongsa.
-Ongsa.

454
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,960
Ongsa.

455
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,600
Ongsa.

456
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,080
Are you all right, honey?

457
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
What happened?

458
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,799
Did someone do something to you? Tell me.

459
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,120
Ongsa.

460
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,799
What happened?

461
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,759
It's okay, Ongsa.

462
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm right here.

463
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,359
Come here.

464
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,400
Just cry if you want.

465
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,799
It's okay.

466
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,759
Thanks, Alpha.

467
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,520
We found Ongsa.

468
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,560
She's home.

469
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,839
Safe.

470
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,160
Don't worry.

471
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,799
I like it.

472
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,160
It's beautiful.

473
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:19,920
Ongsa is Earth.

474
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,520
Earth is Ongsa.

475
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,920
You don't have to call me "senior."

476
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,000
My name is Sun. What's yours?

477
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,160
My name is Ongsa.

478
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,600
Whenever you smile,

479
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,520
I don't know what to do with myself.

480
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,680
I like someone.

481
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:46,480
How likely is it that that person
will reciprocate my feelings?

482
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:48,319
Very likely.

483
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,400
Of course.

484
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,839
That person must like you very much.

485
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,400
Ongsa!

486
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,319
Earth sent me a present.

487
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,400
It's good that Ongsa is Earth.

488
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,600
Ongsa, I have something to tell you.

489
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Ongsa, what happened yesterday?

490
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,759
Nothing, Mom.

491
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:58,200
It can't be nothing.

492
00:43:58,279 --> 00:43:59,560
You disappeared for hours.

493
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,279
Ongsa,

494
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,200
it's okay if you're still uncomfortable
and not ready to tell us.

495
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,799
I just want you to know that

496
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:17,319
your mom and I,
Alpha, and Aylin are your family.

497
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,520
We will always be there for you.

498
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:22,960
Yes, Dad.

499
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,799
I know.

500
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:28,520
Thank you all so much.

501
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,120
I'm gonna

502
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,240
go out and get Latte some food.

503
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,440
He's out of food.

504
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,200
Should I go with you?

505
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,839
It's all right.

506
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,000
It's just nearby.

507
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm coming with you, human.

508
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:46,319
It's fine, Aylin.

509
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
It won't take long.

510
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Why did you let her go by herself?

511
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,520
Aren't you worried about her?

512
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,799
Of course I am.

513
00:45:00,879 --> 00:45:03,120
But don't forget that
she's a grown-up now.

514
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,319
Don't worry too much.

515
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,680
I understand your concern,

516
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,240
but there are some problems

517
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:13,400
we just can't fix for her.

518
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,319
She must solve them herself.

519
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:23,279
All we can do is support her

520
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,319
through the difficult times.

521
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,520
I think when the time comes,
she will tell us.

522
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,520
Be patient.

523
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,319
Don't worry.

524
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,600
Sunny.

525
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,000
Ongsa.

526
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,799
Did you get my message?

527
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,240
I sent it to you last night.

528
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,359
I saw it but was too afraid to read it.

529
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,319
Don't you want to talk to me anymore?

530
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,120
How can I talk to you, Sun?

531
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,960
I feel bad beyond words right now.

532
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,520
I want you to talk to me directly.

533
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,319
I don't have the guts.

534
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,000
Can you please talk to me?

535
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,680
I don't have the right.

536
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:58,680
Ongsa!

537
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,040
Ongsa, wait.

538
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:10,279
Ongsa!

539
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,480
Ongsa!

540
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,120
Ongsa.

541
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,240
How are you?

542
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,680
Doing okay?

543
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,799
You know, I couldn't sleep.

544
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,520
No one said goodnight to me before bed.

545
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,560
It's awkward talking to myself, you know?

546
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,759
It's just me talking in the chat

547
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,440
and it's just me talking now.

548
00:49:58,879 --> 00:49:59,799
I'm sorry.

549
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,720
For what?

550
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,120
For being a girl.

551
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,520
I'm not Earth.

552
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,680
I'm not a guy like you prefer.

553
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,440
Do you see me?

554
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,600
I'm not a guy.

555
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:25,120
So?

556
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:28,480
We can only be friends.

557
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,160
I doubt we can even be friends.

558
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,680
Why did you come up with that by yourself?

559
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:41,720
Why didn't you ask me?

560
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,799
Well, I'm a girl.

561
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:51,640
Girl or guy,

562
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:56,000
Ongsa or Earth,

563
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,920
the one I talked to is you, Ongsa.

564
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,120
I don't want you
to disappear from my life.

565
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,600
All this time we've talked,

566
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:25,440
it's felt great.

567
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,720
I'm thankful to you
for always being by my side.

568
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,520
For making me smile and laugh.

569
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,879
I've been happy.

570
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:47,160
Anyway, I must admit that…

571
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,040
I'm not sure…

572
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:57,399
if you and I,

573
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,319
a girl and a girl,

574
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,319
can actually happen.

575
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:12,720
I understand.

576
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,799
Things between us can never happen.

577
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,799
But because I'm not sure,

578
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,520
I'd like to get to know you again, Ongsa.

579
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,759
I really want to know you.

580
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,920
Ongsa,

581
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,720
I don't know what the destination will be,

582
00:52:55,879 --> 00:53:00,879
but can you please stay with me
until we reach it?

583
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:08,879
Then, all of a sudden, the universe
gave me a chance to start over.

584
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,040
Hi.

585
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,120
I'm Sun.

586
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:24,799
And this time, I won't screw up.

587
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:31,600
I won't drift away
from my orbit around her.

588
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,839
Hi. I'm Ongsa.

589
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,040
It's nice to meet you, Sun.

590
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,600
Ongsa, do you like me that much?

591
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,799
I do, but I'm afraid
you'll feel uncomfortable.

592
00:54:21,879 --> 00:54:25,200
How about we take it slow?

593
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,799
I don't want you to think
you're inferior to anyone.

594
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:31,720
Ongsa is Ongsa.

595
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,040
That's enough for me.

596
00:54:36,759 --> 00:54:39,600
You two humans, are you girlfriends now?
