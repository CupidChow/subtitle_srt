1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Any couple who watches meteor showers
together at school will be lucky in love.

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,959
-What are you doing?
-Making a wish in Morse code.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,600
Well then, should we
watch the shower together?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,440
Pretty.

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,000
Is the Earth tilting or what?

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,919
Yes.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,960
At a very good angle.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,800
I don't mind it tilting more often then.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,520
You can just be yourself
as you are right now.

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,720
It's enough to make me want to kiss you.

11
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,680
It's late.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,440
Want to go to bed yet?

13
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,519
I can leave.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,920
No. I'm not sleepy

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,040
and I don't want you to leave yet.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,839
Why are you up so late tonight?

17
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:51,120
You're usually sleeping by now.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,519
I don't know.

19
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:57,640
I guess I'm so happy
that I don't want tonight to end.

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,399
But it's late.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Then

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,759
can you tell me a bedtime story?

23
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:12,920
What story?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,360
I don't know how to tell stories.

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
Then tell me anything you want.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,960
Can I

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,960
tell you about the Earth?

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
Of course.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,199
That sounds just like you, Ongsa.

30
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,520
Do you know why
the Earth's axis is tilted?

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Why?

32
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:52,640
There's a theory that claims that
the Earth's axis didn't start off tilted.

33
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,280
The axis used to be upright.

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
Really?

35
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,080
A long time ago,

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,360
an ancient planet called Theia
slammed into the Earth.

37
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,759
Boom!

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
It caused the upright axis
to tilt by 23.5 degrees.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,239
The Earth's fractured body formed the
moon, which now orbits the Earth.

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,799
Hearing that,

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
I kind of feel sad for the Earth.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
But there are benefits to it.

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,160
The Earth's axial tilt
gives us 24 hours a day.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,600
If it'd been upright,
we might've had only eight hours a day.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,720
Really?

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,600
I think eight hours in a day
wouldn't be enough.

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,160
I wouldn't be okay with that.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,560
Why not?

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,040
Because if there were only
eight hours in a day,

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,720
it would mean I had less time with you.

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,359
I want to be with you longer than that.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's thank the Earth's tilted axis

53
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,079
for giving us more time
to be together then.

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
Latte.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,600
Ongsa.

56
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,160
Have you ever thought about what you want
to be after graduating from college?

57
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,239
I want to be a veterinarian.

58
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,560
Really?

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,519
Why?

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, I love animals

61
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,399
and I want to take care of them

62
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
just like I take care of Latte.

63
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,679
Hey, Ongsa.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,799
Have you ever heard the saying that
a pet and its owner look alike?

65
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,719
Look.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,640
You and Latte look just the same.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
What?

68
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
Are you saying I look like a dog?

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,599
You do look like one.

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,320
Look. You are so cute just like him.

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Nope. I'm cuter.

72
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
Latte is cuter.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,200
Hey!

74
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,240
-Are you teasing me?
-Don't tickle me.

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,520
Teasing me?

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,640
So, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,240
I want to travel.

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,440
Just travel?

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
I want to see the world out there.

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,520
If possible, I'd like to ride Sunny
around the world

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,440
before I come back to take on
my family business.

82
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,479
After that, I won't have much time
to travel anymore.

83
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,719
Whoa. You have everything planned out?

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,479
Yeah.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,719
It doesn't hurt to plan ahead.

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
I also plan to join

87
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,280
the student exchange program
in the States this summer.

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,520
Do you want to join me?

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
I don't know.

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,200
I have to talk to my parents first.

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,599
But I don't think my parents would like
the idea of me living far away.

92
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,440
Dad and I only just moved to Bangkok.

93
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:50,000
We only just got to live together
as a full family.

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,320
And there's Latte.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm worried about him.

96
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
If I go by myself,
won't you be worried about me?

97
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,800
You only care about Latte, huh?

98
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,479
Don't tell me you are jealous of a dog.

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm jealous of a dog named Ongsa.

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,919
-Sun. Tickling me?
-Don't tickle me back.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,520
Latte, help! Latte.

102
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,599
He won't help you. He's on my team.

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Sun, it tickles.

104
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,799
-Latte! I'm gonna fight you.
-Tickle, tickle!

105
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
-Ongsa, stop.
-You wanna play this game?

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,440
-Ongsa, it tickles!
-Do you surrender?

107
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,159
-Do you?
-No.

108
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,799
Do you surrender now?

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Are you surrendering?

110
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,599
Still fighting?

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,440
Ongsa.

112
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,400
Ongsa, stop.

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,280
DAD AND I WILL BE IN PHUKET FOR A WEEK.

114
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,640
ORDER FROM UNCLE PIAK'S DINER
IF YOU GET HUNGRY. MOM

115
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,280
During Mom and Dad's stay in Phuket,

116
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,000
we can get takeout
from Uncle Piak's diner.

117
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,760
Mom will take care of the bill later.

118
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Who ordered this?

119
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,039
I did, human cousin.

120
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,080
What…?

121
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,320
I don't know either.

122
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,919
Right.

123
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,760
Okay.

124
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,280
Um, Aylin, what are you doing?

125
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,640
Serving you with a serving mind.

126
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,040
Why… why are you doing this?

127
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,040
Are you okay?

128
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,280
Aylin,

129
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,640
are you sick?

130
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,400
A human senior told me
to socialize with humans

131
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,079
starting with family members.

132
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,439
What the heck is happening?

133
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,880
I have no idea.

134
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,480
This is the first time
I've seen her like this.

135
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,600
True.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,839
Dip.

137
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,640
Yes, dip.

138
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,480
Ongsa.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Sun.

140
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:03,400
You seem happy to see me.

141
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,520
I am happy. My girlfriend came to see me.

142
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,120
I can't help but flush
every time you call me girlfriend.

143
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
Same here.

144
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,360
So, where do you wanna go, girlfriend?

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,079
I don't know.

146
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,800
In that case, is there anything
you wanna do, girlfriend?

147
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,800
Anything I want to do?

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
I want to ride a motorbike.

149
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,839
Of course. I'll take you on a ride.

150
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,800
No, not that.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,800
I mean, I…

152
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,680
I want to learn how to ride a motorbike.

153
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,760
Why do you wanna learn all of a sudden?

154
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, I'm always

155
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:59,040
your passenger.

156
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,040
I'd like to learn how to ride a motorbike

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,199
so that you can be my passenger too.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
Sure. I'll teach you.

159
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,120
Is it difficult?

160
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,400
Actually, if you can bicycle,
it should be easy.

161
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,680
Can you bicycle?

162
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,839
I…

163
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,439
I can't.

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,199
Aw, poor Ongsa.

165
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,800
Come on. I'll teach you.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,959
-Change out of those slippers first.
-Right.

167
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll be right back.

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,520
Ongsa, release the tension in your arms
or it'll be hard to control the handles.

169
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,120
Let's try again. One, two, three, go.

170
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,079
Right.

171
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,520
Slowly.

172
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,199
Ongsa!

173
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,480
Ongsa.

174
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

175
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,199
I am all right.

176
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,719
Get up slowly.

177
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,160
Gosh.

178
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:23,640
I can't even ride a bicycle

179
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,600
let alone a motorbike.

180
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
Come on. Let's go step-by-step.

181
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,439
It took me weeks
to learn how to ride a bicycle.

182
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,319
At what age did you learn
how to ride a bicycle?

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,120
Four.

184
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,640
Crap. I'm hopeless.

185
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,959
There's no way I can ride a bicycle.

186
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,439
Ongsa.

187
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:58,599
I have an idea.

188
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
A little to the right.

189
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,240
See? You can ride a bicycle now.

190
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,240
I can't without you.

191
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
That's good.

192
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,480
How is it good?

193
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,640
That way, you can't live without me.

194
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
I already can't live without you.

195
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,800
Really?

196
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Really.

197
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,319
Come on. Let's go feed the fish.

198
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,040
Is that…?

199
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
Aylin, what are you doing?

200
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,199
Human friends,
what are you guys doing here?

201
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
I should be asking you that.

202
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,599
What are you doing here?

203
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,959
I came to look for aliens.

204
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,199
Aliens? In the park?

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,160
Why do you need face powder
to look for aliens?

206
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,479
I must be prepared.

207
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,479
It's hot. My face is oily.
I needed to apply some powder.

208
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,640
The green soda is here--

209
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,959
Hey, Ongsa, Sun.

210
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,040
Hey, didn't you say
you were looking for aliens, Aylin?

211
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,839
What aliens?

212
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,479
Aylin just said--

213
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,040
Human Sun. Stop talking.

214
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,839
Hey. Why did you raise your voice
at your friend?

215
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,680
I didn't mean to.

216
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,959
By the way,
why do you look extra pretty today?

217
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,199
Your facial skin is so smooth.

218
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
Don't poke me.

219
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,640
Did you want to look nice for me?

220
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,280
Why do you two seem…?

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,479
You seem suspicious.

222
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,240
Well, Aylin and I are girlfriends.

223
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,319
What?

224
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,000
Since when?

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,479
We both confessed.
That means we are girlfriends now.

226
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,400
What?

227
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,359
Neither of us made
an official relationship proposal.

228
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,400
But

229
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,959
I kissed you on the cheek already.

230
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,920
What?

231
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
Wicked.

232
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,839
But Ongsa is more wicked.

233
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,280
How?

234
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,680
You guys only had a cheek kiss.

235
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,359
But we had a real kiss.

236
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,359
Sun, why are you telling them this?

237
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm sorry. It slipped out, girlfriend.

238
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,400
They call each other girlfriend.

239
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,920
We must fight them.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,319
-Can we do that too?
-No.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,560
-No.
-Girlfriend.

242
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,800
Girlfriend.

243
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,520
Where are you going?

244
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,040
Can I get a hug, girlfriend?

245
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
-Girlfriend.
-Human senior!

246
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,839
Girlfriend.

247
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,680
One, two, three, four.

248
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,839
One, two, three, four.

249
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,119
-One, two, three, four.
-Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

250
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,760
One, two, three, four.

251
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,800
Mawin.

252
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,359
What?

253
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,359
What are you doing?

254
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,240
Look at me.
Do I look like I came here to cook?

255
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,520
I came to work out, of course!

256
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,760
I've never seen you work out
even once in my life.

257
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,159
What's gotten into you?

258
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,720
I want to look good for Tinh.

259
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,879
I don't want to be just his senior.

260
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,560
Bye.

261
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:51,120
One, two.

262
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,879
-One, two.
-Hey! Why are you copying me?

263
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,280
I am sad that she won't accept me.

264
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,680
What? Who?

265
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,600
Charoenporn. Little Miss Dhamma Lover.

266
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,000
-You like Charoen?
-Don't!

267
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,600
Don't say I like her.

268
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,919
Let's just say

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,600
that I belong to her
mentally and physically.

270
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,040
Right.

271
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,919
No wonder she didn't accept you.

272
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,280
Life is sad, man.

273
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
So, we must run.

274
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Run and run.

275
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,760
-Run.
-Yeah.

276
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
Let sweat come out of your pores.

277
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
-Yes.
-Don't let tears come out of your eyes.

278
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,080
-Yes!
-So, we must run.

279
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,639
-Run!
-Run!

280
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
Run! Run! Run!

281
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,159
-Go.
-Run!

282
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,159
Left. Left. Left. Left and right.
Left. Left. Left. Left and right.

283
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,360
Aylin.

284
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:04,560
Do you realize what time it is?

285
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:08,040
You took advantage of your aunt and
uncle's absence by coming home so late.

286
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,800
I just made a stop to buy something
on the way home.

287
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,000
It's not that late.

288
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,480
What's going on?

289
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
You too.

290
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
What time is it?

291
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,879
Why did you only just get home?

292
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,520
I normally come home at this hour.

293
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,720
But you didn't tell me
you'd be home at this hour.

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,000
Usually, I don't need to tell you.

295
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,399
Didn't Alpha say where she was going?

296
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,720
She just left.

297
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,520
She isn't answering her phone.

298
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:02,399
Did you guys have a fight because of me?

299
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,159
No.

300
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,159
It's…

301
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,440
It's just me she's mad at.

302
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,960
Human senior, have you ever asked her
what's been going on?

303
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,800
I haven't talked to her much.

304
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
I always spend time with you.

305
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,159
What a messy eater.

306
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,639
I think I get her now.

307
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,320
She must be tired.

308
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,000
She's the oldest.
She has the most responsibility.

309
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,600
Despite how she appears,
she's very stressed.

310
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,480
University is one thing.

311
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,720
She doesn't even know
what she wants to enroll in.

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,520
Alpha wants to get into medical school.

313
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
That's true,

314
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,800
but she isn't sure she truly wants to.

315
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,360
Alpha loves to make plans.

316
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,399
When her confidence is shaken,
she must feel lost.

317
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
Then there's you.

318
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,879
She barely knows anything about you.

319
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,159
She must think she's a bad sister.

320
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,280
What should we eat, Teacher Bambam?

321
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,879
It's a day off. The cafeteria isn't open.

322
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,040
-Should we order something?
-What about the noodle restaurant nearby?

323
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,200
But it's too far.

324
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,200
Right. Okay then.

325
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,960
Teacher Bambam, Teacher Nida, hi.

326
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,240
Hi.

327
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
What are you doing in school today?

328
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:12,520
I couldn't think of a place to read,
so I came here.

329
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,960
It's peaceful.

330
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,240
If you have a problem,
I'm all ears, Alpha.

331
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,320
I just really needed
a spot to read, ma'am.

332
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,760
Alpha, I don't know
what you're going through,

333
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,080
but please know there are people
who care about you

334
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,879
and are willing to listen to you.

335
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,040
As well as teaching,
a teacher's duty is to listen to

336
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,840
and help their students.

337
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,520
In all the time you've been my student,

338
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,520
I've never once seen you come to school
on a day off to read.

339
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,320
I don't know what to do

340
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,399
about my studies,

341
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,159
my future,

342
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,000
and my family matters.

343
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,520
Nothing is following my plan.

344
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
What's your plan?

345
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,720
I want to get into a great school.

346
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,120
I want to be a doctor.

347
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,720
I want to be successful in life.

348
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,520
And I want to be a good sister

349
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,879
who can take care of
her younger family members.

350
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,439
But I'm not sure about anything anymore.

351
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,800
I don't even know if I want to be a doctor

352
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,200
or what I want to do.

353
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,439
I don't even know
if I'm a good enough big sister.

354
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Nothing is the way I pictured it.

355
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,800
And I don't have anyone
to talk to about this.

356
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,960
I don't want people to know
that I have problems.

357
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,439
I don't want to be weak like this, ma'am.

358
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,120
This is not me at all.

359
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
In this world,

360
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,320
there's no chance that everything will
turn out the way we plan, Alpha.

361
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,919
Humans aren't perfect.

362
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,960
There are times
when intelligent people make mistakes

363
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,360
or have self-doubt just like you do now.

364
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,800
But everyone sees me as a perfect girl.

365
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,639
I'm the student president.
A model student.

366
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,639
Don't worry about
what other people think of you.

367
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
Just be who you are. That's enough.

368
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,600
You don't have to carry
anyone else's expectations.

369
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:17,720
What should I do, ma'am?

370
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,280
Find yourself.

371
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Find the answer
to what your happiness looks like.

372
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,480
Perhaps what makes you happy
is something small.

373
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,760
But if you think of it and you smile,

374
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,879
that might tell you what you want to do
or what you want to be.

375
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,520
You don't have to be perfect.

376
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
You're allowed to fail, Alpha.

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,240
I have failed so many times before.

378
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,040
Humans don't need to be perfect.

379
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,879
But why would we want to fail
when we can succeed?

380
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,919
Sometimes, success comes from failure.

381
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,919
And failure makes us realize that
we're not alone in this world.

382
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,760
You may think you must be
a good sister for the youngsters

383
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,919
and get a good job for your family,

384
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,520
but your sisters may not
share your perspective.

385
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,159
What do you mean?

386
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,280
Regardless of the number of times
you flop and fail,

387
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,199
you will always remain
a wonderful sister to them.

388
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,439
Where did Alpha go?

389
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,159
It's so late and she isn't home yet.

390
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080
Have you tried calling her, Luna?

391
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,520
I have. She didn't pick up.

392
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
-Alpha.
-Alpha!

393
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,080
Where have you been?
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

394
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Please don't do this again.

395
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,879
I was worried about you.

396
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,399
Right. Don't do this again, human cousin.

397
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,439
Where have you been?

398
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,560
You can talk to me
about anything, you know.

399
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,399
Or you can talk to your sisters here.

400
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,520
Everybody is so worried about you.

401
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,919
Thank you.

402
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
And sorry to make you guys worry.

403
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm okay now.

404
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,080
You and Sun should go home.

405
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,199
It's late.

406
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,840
I'll go to my room now.

407
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,000
I think Alpha has
thought something through.

408
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,639
That's why she said that.

409
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,439
Just find the right time
to talk to her, Ongsa.

410
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,120
Hello, Dad.

411
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,919
Uncle Piak's diner is closed today.

412
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,320
What's Ongsa's favorite food?

413
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,959
I can smell crispy pork.

414
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,560
Crispy pork.

415
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,199
American fried rice with crispy pork.

416
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,040
Human cousin, does Uncle Piak
have this on his menu?

417
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,679
It's yummy.

418
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,679
Seriously?

419
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,959
I made it.

420
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,480
What?

421
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,120
Uncle Piak's diner is closed today.

422
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:48,800
You like American fried rice

423
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,800
and Aylin likes crispy pork.

424
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,959
So, I tried to combine it.

425
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:07,399
From now on, whether it's what you like,
what you want to do,

426
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,320
or even any problems you may have,

427
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,240
you can always talk to me.

428
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,320
I didn't pay much attention
to you guys before,

429
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:30,600
but from now on, I want to be
part of every step in your life.

430
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,600
You can always talk to us too,
human cousin.

431
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,560
Right. Talk to us.

432
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,320
We want to be part
of every step in your life too.

433
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
Especially

434
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,360
when you make us American fried rice.

435
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,120
You always love the kid's menu.

436
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,120
Do you know why I like
American fried rice?

437
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,879
Why?

438
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:11,199
Because you liked to cook it for me
as a kid.

439
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,360
Then I'll cook it more often. Okay?

440
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,679
So, what do you like to eat?

441
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
What?

442
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,480
You're gonna cook for me?

443
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,000
No. I'll order it for you.

444
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,240
I knew it.

445
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,399
Eat up.

446
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,560
Aylin, eat the rice too,
not just the crispy pork.

447
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,879
Alpha used to cook for me
when we were young.

448
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,080
It was delicious.

449
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,040
But that was a long time ago.

450
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,919
Today, she cooked for me again.

451
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,199
It made me realize that

452
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
she isn't just a good student.

453
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,719
She's also a good cook.

454
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,719
Whoa. Now I want to try her food too.

455
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,760
Eat with us next time.

456
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,199
I will tell Alpha to cook.

457
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,199
I want to dine with your parents too.

458
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,719
Dine with my parents?

459
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,679
Yes.

460
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,199
My parents said to tell you
they'd like you to come over for a meal.

461
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,159
What?

462
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,760
-When?
-Today.

463
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,600
And why are you only telling me now?

464
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,120
Well, they only said it this morning.

465
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,199
So, I am telling you.

466
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,959
Why?

467
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,760
I don't have time to prepare.

468
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,320
What's there to prepare?

469
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,080
Just come over and eat.

470
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,159
I know, but it's the first time
I'll have a meal with your family.

471
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,520
It's so important to me.

472
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,040
Does that mean you're not coming?

473
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,319
No, it's not that.

474
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,040
But can I have more time to prepare?

475
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,839
What's there to prepare?

476
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,000
It's just a meal.

477
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
I…

478
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,520
I need to dress up to see your parents.

479
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,719
So, you want my parents to see
that my girlfriend is pretty?

480
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,759
That's good. I bragged about you a lot.

481
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,679
What?

482
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
Well, my girlfriend is hot.
I couldn't help but brag.

483
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,040
So, you're coming?

484
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:51,759
Yeah!

485
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,040
Can I have some fried vermicelli?

486
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,640
Why didn't you buy it? No.

487
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,960
You should learn frugality.

488
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,560
-If you want it, buy it yourself.
-Can't you just share?

489
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,520
Tinh.

490
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,279
May I sit with you?

491
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,319
Of course, bro. Have a seat.

492
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,080
If you want it, order it next time. Okay?

493
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,680
-No.
-You're so stingy.

494
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,080
Are you sitting or not, Ton?

495
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,759
I'm already sitting.

496
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:21,759
-What?
-What?

497
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
You're standing.

498
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm sitting firmly in your heart.

499
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,600
-How many times have I told you that--
-You don't need to say it, Charoen.

500
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,200
I won't take no for an answer, my dear.

501
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,640
Ton, you asshole.

502
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,319
Sit. You're making me wanna puke.

503
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,640
Luna, Aylin. Sit with us.

504
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,960
What should we say when someone
asks us to join them for a meal?

505
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,319
Can we just eat on the rooftop?

506
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,360
No. I want to eat in the cafeteria.

507
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,200
You promised me you'd socialize

508
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,400
and they're all my friends.

509
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,080
I want you to get to know them.

510
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Have a seat. Eat with us.

511
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:25,960
Or maybe

512
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,520
I make you blush so much, Aylin,

513
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,560
that you're afraid to sit with me.

514
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,720
Damn you, Ton. What a narcissist.

515
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,080
Even I can't resist my own charm.

516
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,560
I doubt other people can.

517
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,440
Is that right, Aylin?

518
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,839
You, male human senior!

519
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:51,880
Aylin!

520
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,279
I'm out of here.

521
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,359
Wait.

522
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Don't follow me.

523
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,440
What?

524
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,799
-Ton, are you okay?
-Do you have tissues?

525
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,720
Sorry about her.
Don't be mad at her, okay?

526
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:14,799
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

527
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,880
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

528
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,279
Yes. Have a seat, Sun.

529
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The student exchange program
in the USA you asked about

530
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,000
is now accepting applications.

531
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,000
Really?

532
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,799
APPLICATION FORM
STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM, USA

533
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,799
If I get accepted,

534
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,839
I'll go during the summer break,
right, Teacher Nida?

535
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,640
Not anymore.

536
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,080
The terms have been a bit altered.

537
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,279
If you get accepted,
you must go for two semesters.

538
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,200
That means one year.

539
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,680
One year?

540
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,359
That's right. Is there a problem?

541
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,480
Teacher Nida,
I've collected all the workbooks.

542
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,960
You can leave them on my desk, Ongsa.

543
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,120
Is something wrong, Sun?

544
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,839
-Ah, Sun is going--
-Miss.

545
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,319
Will you please excuse me?

546
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:39,759
Thank you.

547
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Of course.

548
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:45,400
Let's go, Ongsa.

549
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Hey.

550
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,839
You can talk to me about any problems
you might be having. Anything at all.

551
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm here to listen.

552
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,319
Can you please tell me

553
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,520
why you try so hard to be an alien?

554
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
Latte, you smell just like Ongsa.

555
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,120
If I'm gone for a year, will you be able
to recognize me when I'm back?

556
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,839
Don't play yet. Will you recognize me?

557
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,160
You're adorable.

558
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,839
Look at you, Latte.
You're so clingy with Sun, aren't you?

559
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,960
Just like his owner.

560
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,200
He is indeed like Ongsa.

561
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:41,400
Where is Ongsa anyway?

562
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,240
She went upstairs to change.

563
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,520
Change? Where are you guys going?

564
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
We're going to have dinner at my place.

565
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,040
My parents asked her to come.

566
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,279
And she needs to change just for that?

567
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,120
That's what I said too, Alpha.

568
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,680
Thank you, Sun.

569
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,920
For what?

570
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,680
For loving my sister.

571
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,680
Well, your sister is loveable.

572
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,680
Actually, Ongsa suffers from
low self-esteem sometimes.

573
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,240
Bear with her, okay?

574
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:23,520
I understand.

575
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,120
Please take care of her.

576
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:29,600
This girl is faint of heart.

577
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,480
She doesn't see you for a day
and she's already sad like a lost dog.

578
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,600
Do not leave my sister, okay?

579
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,960
Ongsa is crazy in love.

580
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,640
I can't imagine her not seeing you
for even just a few days.

581
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:53,279
I'm sure she would be devastated.

582
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,240
Hey, Sun!

583
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
You spilled your drink on yourself.

584
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,400
Let me get you some tissues.

585
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,359
Sun!

586
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,480
What happened?

587
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,319
I spaced out for a bit
and spilled my drink.

588
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,880
Ongsa, get her cleaned up.

589
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,359
I'll take care of things here.

590
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,839
Let's go, Sun.

591
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,960
Get up slowly.

592
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,960
You should wash up first.

593
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,359
I'll get you some fresh clothes.

594
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,560
Come on.

595
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Sun.

596
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,960
I borrowed Alpha's clothes,
but I'm not sure if they will fit you.

597
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:52,080
Try them on.

598
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:57,720
Sun.

599
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,640
Are you okay in there?

600
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,120
Sun.

601
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,880
Sorry.

602
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,080
It felt sticky so I took a shower.

603
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,319
Why are you looking at me like that?

604
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,920
Am I still not clean?

605
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,720
It's not that.

606
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,319
Then why are you looking at me like that?

607
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,799
When you're soaked, you look like a puppy.

608
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,600
Yes, because I just took a shower.

609
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,879
Ongsa, what are you doing?

610
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,200
You're

611
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,319
a puppy that smells too nice.

612
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,240
Should I be happy
to hear that I'm like a puppy?

613
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,759
I love you, Sun.

614
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,359
I want to spend every day with you.

615
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,600
I love you too.

616
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,200
I want to spend every day with you too.

617
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,200
The Earth tilts again?

618
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,120
This has nothing to do with
the Earth's axial tilt.

619
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,520
I want you all to myself.

620
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,400
What does…

621
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,720
that mean?

622
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,759
Hey. What are you all doing here so late?

623
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,200
I can't seem to find peace of mind.

624
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,879
I came seeking mental help.

625
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,759
We need to find a way to help her,
at least as the Student Committee.

626
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,879
The tarot cards are telling me
you're falling in love with someone.

627
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,920
Oops!

628
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Are you being friend-zoned?

629
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,799
Do you think one year is
a long time, Ongsa?

630
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,279
It is.

631
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,680
It's long enough
for many things to change.

632
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,120
Why do you ask?

633
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,359
I'm thinking about taking a test
for the US exchange program scholarship.

634
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,080
What did you just say?
