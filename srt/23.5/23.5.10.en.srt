1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,319
My parents said to tell you
they'd like you to come over for a meal.

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,760
Why are you only telling me now?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,520
You promised me you'd socialize.

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,600
Don't follow me.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,080
The student exchange program
in the USA you asked about

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,200
is now accepting applications.

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,240
One year?

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
I love you, Sun.
I want to spend every day with you.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,599
I love you too, Ongsa.

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,919
I want to spend every day with you too.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,080
What does that mean?

12
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,640
Sun, don't look. Don't look!

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,640
-Ongsa, you don't look.
-I'm not looking. I'm not seeing anything.

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,839
What's going on?

15
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,160
What is it? What?

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,840
Did someone break in? What happened?

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,520
Why are you holding a knife, Alpha?

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,840
Ongsa, try this clear soup my mom made.

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,120
It's so good.

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,679
Thank you.

21
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,440
Good?

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,079
It's good.

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Ongsa.

24
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,320
Sun told me you moved here from Phuket.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,840
How are you doing?
Have you finally adjusted?

26
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:12,640
I think I have, Auntie.

27
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:14,920
No. Mrs. Fueang.

28
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,760
Did you just say Mrs. Fueang, Miss Ongsa?

29
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,120
"Mrs. Fueang." I like that.

30
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,760
Honey, don't tease her.

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,959
You too, Sun.

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,359
Ongsa, you can call me Mom.
Sun's girlfriend is like a daughter to me.

33
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,399
Mom.

34
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,799
Mrs. Fueang…

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,200
I mean, Mom.

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,119
Did you just say I was Sun's girlfriend?

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,160
I did.

38
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,200
You are Sun's girlfriend, aren't you?

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,440
Come on, Mom.
You don't have to broadcast it.

40
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,519
Says the girl who is smiling
from ear to ear.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,799
Dad! Don't tease me.

42
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,399
My daughter is just the coolest.

43
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,519
Of course I am.

44
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,440
So you are okay with Sun dating me,

45
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,399
who is also a girl?

46
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,640
Girls date girls these days.

47
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:24,039
There's nothing weird at all.
Love is not defined by gender.

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,320
That's right. We're totally fine.

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,680
Sun can be with anyone, boy or girl,

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
as long as she loves them
and they love her.

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,080
My daughter might be small
but she can be a big pain, Ongsa.

52
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,039
Mom, I'm not.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,440
Don't believe her, Ongsa.

54
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,520
Mom and Dad,
I will take the best care of Sun.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Please do so, Ongsa.

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,159
I should be the one who takes care of you.

57
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
You've always taken care of me.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Well, I want to.

59
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,039
You're still a kid.

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
You're also a kid, just like me.

61
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
You can take care of each other.

62
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:14,680
And do you know the secret
to a long-lasting love?

63
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,479
What is it?

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,599
No keeping secrets.

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,520
It's the key to our love.
That's how we've stayed together this far.

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,080
True. Especially about money.

67
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
No financial secrets.

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm full.

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
-Excuse me.
-Sit back down and eat.

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Sit.

71
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,760
-Have some.
-Okay.

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Ongsa.

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
What's up?

74
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,080
Do you think one year is a long time?

75
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,200
Why do you ask?

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
I just want to know if one year
would be a long time for you.

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,919
I think it is.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,760
It's long enough
for many things to change.

79
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,799
Like when Alpha and I were kids.

80
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,359
We were both the same height.

81
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,159
But then Alpha moved to Bangkok
and we didn't see each other for a year.

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,240
I grew a lot taller.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,640
And do you love Alpha just the same?

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,359
I do.

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,919
Why do you ask?

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
I've got something to ask you.

87
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
What is it?

88
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
Let's suppose

89
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,039
that one day,
we have to live far away from each other.

90
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,120
How would you cope with that?

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,359
Far away? How far?

92
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,039
Well,

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,359
very far away.

94
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,960
If it happened, I could always call you.

95
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,039
But if I miss you too much,
I might have to go there to visit you.

96
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,359
Really?

97
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,960
Why do you ask?

98
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,479
Where are you going?

99
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,560
Nowhere.

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,400
It was just a hypothetical question.

101
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,159
I'm not going anywhere.

102
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,039
That's good.

103
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,640
I'd be so lonely
if I didn't get to see you for that long.

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,599
Mini Sunny.

105
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,319
Hey.

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,640
What's going on, Luna?

107
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,079
Is Aylin home?

108
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,840
Isn't she with you?

109
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,520
She hasn't come home yet.

110
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,079
She's not picking up.

111
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,040
What happened? Did you have a fight?

112
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,040
No.

113
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,720
There was just a small incident at lunch.

114
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,920
I urged her to try socializing
and have lunch with other people.

115
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,400
She promised me she would.

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,199
But when the time came,
she just disappeared.

117
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,680
She's not picking up her phone.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Do you know anything about her?

119
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,760
Did something happen to her as a kid?

120
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
To be honest…

121
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:51,120
I know nothing about Aylin.

122
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
I really suck.

123
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,400
We live under the same roof,
yet I know nothing about those two.

124
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
It's okay.

125
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,800
I'll try calling her again.

126
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,760
Hey. Aylin just messaged me.

127
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm seeking the cessation of suffering.
Be home soon.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
What's going on with her?

129
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,839
-What the heck is wrong now?
-Are we really going?

130
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,800
Heck yeah!

131
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
The gate is closed, man.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Does it look closed to you?

133
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Take a look.

134
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
You're breaking and entering.

135
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,040
Shit. Ton.

136
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Let's leave.

137
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,800
Are you scared?

138
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,040
You said you didn't believe
ghosts were real.

139
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,560
Well, the surroundings are scary.

140
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,360
And I've never been to a temple
at night before.

141
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
Haven't you attended a funeral?

142
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,199
No.

143
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,719
Has no one in your life died at all?

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,360
No!

145
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,959
My dad, mom, grandpa, grandma,

146
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,199
uncles, aunts, close relatives,
and distant relatives are all fine.

147
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,120
You'll be the first person
in my life who dies.

148
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,719
What a mouth, asshole.

149
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,319
No wonder Charoen doesn't like you.

150
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
It's not the time to talk about Charoen.

151
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,800
We are hunting down a ghost
at Luangpu Sek's temple, my friend.

152
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,880
No way.

153
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,280
You came to see her.

154
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,600
Do you really think she will be here
at this hour?

155
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
Use your brain.

156
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,199
Why are we even here?

157
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
Shut up. We're already here.

158
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,400
Holy shit! What is that?

159
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
Don't spook me, man.

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,079
I don't know.

161
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,959
-What the…?
-What is that?

162
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,319
Don't push me. I might fall.

163
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,920
Get closer and take a look.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
It must be a Preta ghost.

165
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,680
What?

166
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,319
Pretas can't hide in bushes.

167
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,120
A small one could. It must have committed
fewer sins than its folks.

168
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,439
-What?
-Let me film it.

169
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,760
-You're still in the mood to film it?
-Yes.

170
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,000
-I'm not a Preta.
-Holy shit!

171
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,079
A talking Preta?

172
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,280
Ton, you dumbass.

173
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,520
That was a human voice.

174
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
Hey.

175
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,959
What are you doing here, Aylin?

176
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
Are you looking for a Preta like we are?

177
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
Stop talking about Pretas, will you?

178
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,319
Has something happened, Aylin?

179
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,079
Is something bothering you?

180
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,280
Hey, you lot.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,640
What are you guys doing here
so late at night?

182
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,199
We're sorry, Luangpu.

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,680
We're just…

184
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,199
I didn't know where to go.

185
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,040
I can't seem to find peace of mind.

186
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
So, I came seeking mental help.

187
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,400
Would you like to hear a sermon?

188
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,000
No, sir. I'm leaving.

189
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Are you sure?

190
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,560
Goodnight, sir.

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,959
Hold on.

192
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,719
Let your seniors take you home.

193
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,280
Nighttime can be quite unsafe.

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,199
Would you mind taking her home?

195
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:45,839
You guys go to the same school, right?

196
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,599
Yes, Luangpu.

197
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,959
Remember.

198
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,920
If you feel troubled or have concerns,

199
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,719
talking about them with someone
can be helpful.

200
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,959
Do you understand?

201
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,480
May you all be blessed.

202
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,199
Let's go, Aylin. We will take you home.

203
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,880
-If we all go together, we should be safe.
-That's right. Come on.

204
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,079
TEMPLE

205
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,120
What's taking them so long?

206
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,920
Here they are.

207
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
Aylin.

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,959
What…?

209
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
We were worried sick.

210
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,400
Are you okay?

211
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,640
I am okay, human senior, human cousin.

212
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,800
We took good care of her. Don't worry.

213
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
So how come you guys
found her at a temple?

214
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,439
Mawin and I went to Luangpu Sek's temple
to hunt down a ghost.

215
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,760
We coincidentally found her there.

216
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,079
What were you doing at the temple, Aylin?

217
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,199
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

218
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,719
Excuse me.

219
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I think she's got something on her mind.

220
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,959
You were there with her.

221
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,640
Don't you know what happened?

222
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,560
We still can't figure out
why she was there.

223
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,880
I tried asking her
but she refused to answer.

224
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,880
It's like she's keeping a secret.

225
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,959
I think we need to find a way to help her,

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,719
at least as the Student Committee.

227
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,120
Thank you guys so much
for looking after Aylin today.

228
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,280
You're welcome.

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,199
We're leaving now.

230
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
See you tomorrow.

231
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,160
Get home safe.

232
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,199
Go inside.

233
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,479
Bye-bye.

234
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,439
See you tomorrow.

235
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
See you.

236
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
Come on.

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,280
Now take me home.

238
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,439
Yes, Miss Luna.

239
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,800
What? Aylin did that?

240
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,800
Yes.

241
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,520
She smeared a plate full of food
on Ton's face.

242
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,000
Has she been stressed about something?

243
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,839
Aylin isn't usually like that.

244
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,159
Right, Ongsa?

245
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,520
Right.

246
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,800
But I don't know much about Aylin.

247
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,079
I got to know her better
after I moved to Bangkok.

248
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,720
But as for what happened before that…

249
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
she's never told me.

250
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I think

251
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,480
I get her.

252
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:39,000
There must be something

253
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,879
she doesn't know how to tell people.

254
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,320
So, she chooses to keep it inside.

255
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,040
But we're friends. She can tell us.

256
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,639
Some things aren't that easy.

257
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,600
I asked around about Aylin.

258
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,560
What do you know?

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,280
She doesn't have friends
in her class at all.

260
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,720
And it's been worse lately.

261
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,399
She doesn't talk to anyone.

262
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,320
But before this, she followed my advice.

263
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
It seemed like she was fine.

264
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,560
Why is she like this now?

265
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,600
Do you know about the graph of courage?

266
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,080
What are you talking about?

267
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,240
Hold on.

268
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,080
Hold it.

269
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,800
To do something, we need courage.

270
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,280
This line will go up, up, and up.

271
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:21,240
Especially with some support,
the line will shoot up like this.

272
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
But at some point,

273
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,159
you'll feel like you're up too high.

274
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Then you get scared,

275
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:40,840
and when you're scared,
the courage you once had will disappear.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,840
And then

277
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:44,600
you fall.

278
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,159
Bam! Even below your starting point.

279
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,600
See?

280
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,919
I think this is
what is happening with Aylin.

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,080
Wow, Ton. You're capable
of getting serious.

282
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,960
Come on.

283
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't ruin my cool, man.

284
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:11,120
So that means that
if we know what she's scared of,

285
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,240
we might be able to help her.

286
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:21,320
But the problem is,
we don't know what she's scared of.

287
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,240
Hey.

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,560
Maybe we should take this
to Teacher Bambam.

289
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,679
She might know a way to help Aylin.

290
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,080
We should.

291
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
Yes, we can talk to her.

292
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,000
I think teacher Bambam and Aylin
share some similarities.

293
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,560
Why would you think that?

294
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,159
Because…

295
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,120
Because Teacher Bambam
is similar to Aylin.

296
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,320
You're talking about beauty, right?

297
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,639
Your weirdness.

298
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,879
Teacher Nida.

299
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,120
Please, Teacher Bambam. Please help Aylin.

300
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,879
I'm glad that you two
are worried about her

301
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,720
because I am worried about her myself.

302
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,040
But I'd like you guys
to think from a different point of view.

303
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,760
If someone doesn't want to express
what's inside just yet,

304
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,840
what do you think would be the reason?

305
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,720
They aren't ready?

306
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,720
Correct.

307
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,840
And what do they need

308
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,159
in order to be ready?

309
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,120
Time?

310
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,600
Correct.

311
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,639
Everything takes time.

312
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,520
Different people
take different amounts of time.

313
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,879
Some people are hesitant
to speak their minds

314
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,639
because they are still taking their time
to find a way to say it

315
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,960
or decide on what to do.

316
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,919
That's what I would do.

317
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,480
What if, in the end,
Aylin decides not to tell?

318
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,800
If she decides not to tell,
that's her choice.

319
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,879
All we can do is support and trust her.

320
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,080
At the end of the day,

321
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,000
we can never force someone to share
their true feelings, right?

322
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Human Sun.

323
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:17,720
Why are you up here?

324
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,960
It's peaceful up here.

325
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,399
I came to clear my head.

326
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,960
Am I invading your personal space?

327
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,520
No.

328
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,520
Then may I sit?

329
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,320
Aylin,

330
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,800
how long do you think
a person can keep a secret?

331
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,960
As long as they can…

332
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,679
till they decide
it shouldn't be a secret anymore.

333
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,560
You've got something on your mind,
haven't you?

334
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,080
Me too.

335
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,800
If you're afraid to say it

336
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,280
because you think it'll make you feel bad

337
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,399
or look weak,

338
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,240
don't be.

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,080
It's not that simple.

340
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I know.

341
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,520
But you must say it

342
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,520
in order to remember that
there's someone who is willing to listen.

343
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,520
What about what's on your mind?

344
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,360
It will happen too…

345
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,320
after I say it.

346
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,720
Say what?

347
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,120
Thank you for dropping me off.

348
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,960
Ongsa.

349
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,919
I've got something to talk to you about.

350
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,280
What is it, Sun?

351
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,720
Sun.

352
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,399
Is something bothering you?

353
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I…

354
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,320
I'm thinking about taking a test
for the US exchange program scholarship.

355
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,280
What did you just say?

356
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,679
Exchange program?

357
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,320
Teacher Nida told me

358
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,360
there's this scholarship available
for our school.

359
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,960
I told her

360
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,600
I wanted to be an exchange student
and experience living abroad.

361
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,560
So…

362
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
how long would it be?

363
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,159
About…

364
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,040
a year.

365
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,720
A year?

366
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,120
But I'm thinking…

367
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
Thinking what?

368
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,399
I'm thinking you should
take the test with me.

369
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,040
There are two spots.

370
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,720
If we help each other study,
we can both make it.

371
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
I can't go with you, Sun.

372
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,919
Why not?

373
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,679
Don't you want to be with me?

374
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:38,679
Still here?
Do you still need to do something?

375
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,600
Why do you look troubled?

376
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,320
I've just got something on my mind.

377
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,760
Is it about love?

378
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,439
Why would you think that?

379
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,439
Well, I can tell by your expression.

380
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,480
But I can help.

381
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Help?

382
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:09,120
Any problem can be solved
with a few flips of the tarot cards.

383
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
Though just to be clear,
they're a only guideline.

384
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,040
Can those be trusted?

385
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,000
It doesn't hurt to try.

386
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,399
The card clearly says you are in love

387
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,240
and thinking about someone at the moment.

388
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,320
What else does it say?

389
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,879
It says you love the person

390
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,360
but are afraid to express it

391
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:54,399
because you don't know what they think.

392
00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:00,480
If you're afraid of saying it,
they can only be

393
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,679
an acquaintance or a friend.

394
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,080
Oops!

395
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,120
Are you being friend-zoned?

396
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,600
And what if I say it?
Will they be able to take it?

397
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,120
Can you pick three more cards?

398
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,080
These cards say that

399
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,679
the person is quite dense
and doesn't understand anything easily.

400
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,879
Wow. How accurate.

401
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,879
Precise.

402
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,879
Also, they're an unlucky person.

403
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,600
Hapless, to be exact.

404
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:58,399
I always have to help them.

405
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,600
Then you must confess directly.

406
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,560
If I want to confess,
how should I do it, Teacher Bambam?

407
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,959
Are you asking me or the cards?

408
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,719
I am asking you.

409
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,879
If you're afraid to say it straight up,

410
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:27,280
how about sending flowers?

411
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,040
Send them to the one you like.

412
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
What flower?

413
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,879
How about orchids?

414
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,639
Why orchids?

415
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,520
Because orchids are the symbol
of love and graciousness.

416
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,360
More importantly, in love language,

417
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:54,959
orchids say, "I can't stop myself
from missing you."

418
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,879
Good?

419
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,800
Will that person know it?

420
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,520
You can write a note with the flowers.

421
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,000
I hope the person isn't too dense to read.

422
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:35,879
The famous steamed crab meat curry.
A gift from Phuket.

423
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,320
Thank you.

424
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:41,719
Eat up.

425
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,199
You don't like it?

426
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,560
It's from your favorite place, Ongsa.

427
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,959
It's not that. It still tastes good.

428
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,040
Thank you for bringing them.

429
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,159
Did something happen
while we weren't here?

430
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:13,719
Nothing.

431
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,600
Kids, we are family.

432
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,520
We shouldn't keep secrets from each other.

433
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Whatever it is, we can share.

434
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,440
Honey.

435
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
Let's put it this way.

436
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:42,319
Whatever problem you may have,
you don't have to keep it to yourself.

437
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,679
You always have us
standing right next to you as your family.

438
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,440
Ongsa,

439
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,319
have you talked to Aylin lately?

440
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,440
Not really. She seems like
she doesn't want to talk to anyone.

441
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,680
What about you?

442
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:15,960
What about me?

443
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,600
Are you doing okay?

444
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,880
You seem stressed.

445
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
It's about Sun.

446
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,400
What about Sun?

447
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,600
Sun asked me to join
the exchange program in the US.

448
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,120
Do you want to go?

449
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,720
I think Sun will understand.

450
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,880
The real problem is how you guys will be
when living apart.

451
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,839
Right.

452
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,680
It's a whole year.

453
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,160
Don't stress.

454
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,880
I think you guys
can maintain this relationship.

455
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:08,400
You really think so?

456
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,440
It's good to talk often.

457
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,520
True.

458
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,640
From now on, feel free to come to me

459
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,839
if there's any problem
or if you just want to vent.

460
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,720
Thank you, Alpha.

461
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,720
So, when will you tell Mom about Sun?

462
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,120
I get you,

463
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,880
but you can't hide it from Mom forever.

464
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,240
One day, she's going to find out.

465
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
Aylin, sweetheart.

466
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
Yes, ma'am?

467
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,720
Are you okay, Aylin?

468
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,400
I understand that
you don't trust your classmates

469
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,319
due to your painful past.

470
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,839
I used to be like you.

471
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,160
I know how it feels
to feel like you're different.

472
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,040
Sometimes, choosing to be alone
does not resolve your miserable past.

473
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,440
Opening up to empathetic friends

474
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,960
is the way to forget the pain
from your past.

475
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,520
I get it now.

476
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
Is there anything you want to vent?

477
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,080
We are all ears.

478
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,160
No.

479
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,000
Please excuse me.

480
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:48,200
What?

481
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
With all that talking,
I thought she would open up to us.

482
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,600
Right.

483
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,200
We came all the way up here.

484
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
I hope I don't fall down the stairs again
on my way back.

485
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,720
But there are elevators, Teacher Bambam.

486
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,720
Why didn't you say so
when we came up here?

487
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
Well…

488
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,200
-Elevators?
-Yes.

489
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,839
About the exchange program…

490
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,960
Why do you want to join
the exchange program?

491
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:39,960
How should I explain?

492
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,600
It's important to you, isn't it?

493
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,720
I…

494
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,799
I have a dream.

495
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,440
I dream of exploring the world.

496
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:00,200
I want to travel.

497
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,279
Live with people
who speak different languages than us.

498
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,480
I want to try living abroad
for once in my life

499
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,400
because after I graduate from college,

500
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,520
I'll have to take on the family business.

501
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,160
Though my parents have never said so,

502
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,160
I, as their only child, can't abandon
what my mom and dad have built.

503
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,720
Wow. Your answer is so cool.

504
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
How?

505
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,440
It's cool because

506
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:41,240
you have everything in your life
planned out.

507
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,440
While we're the same age,
you seem a lot more mature.

508
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,560
You are cool too, Ongsa.

509
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,160
I'm not.

510
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,880
I've never planned anything out like you.

511
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,319
I just thought I'd like to be a vet
because I like spending time with Latte.

512
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,720
I don't have a solid plan like you do.

513
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,400
The reason I said you're cool

514
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,279
is because you are kind,

515
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,600
lovely,

516
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,920
and funny.

517
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,680
So…

518
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,440
I have decided that…

519
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,080
I will not join the exchange program.

520
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,000
Why not?

521
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
Because you are my happiness.

522
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
I don't want to be away from my happiness.

523
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,160
But I don't want you to do that.
It is your dream.

524
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,120
I've thought about it for a while.

525
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,920
If you're not going,
I won't take the test for the scholarship.

526
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
You're very important to me, Ongsa.

527
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,600
But…

528
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,200
Human cousin, human Sun, follow me.

529
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:15,560
I've got something to say.

530
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,040
What is it, Aylin?

531
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,520
It's about me being "Alien."

532
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,920
Humans.

533
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,240
Alien knows that everyone here…

534
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,319
thinks of me as their family,

535
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,960
little sister,

536
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,319
and…

537
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:54,759
friend.

538
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,400
You don't see me as an alien
like other people do.

539
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,839
Then why are you acting like
you're an alien, Aylin?

540
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,600
Because humans aren't friendly.

541
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,720
How?

542
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,640
Who did something to you?

543
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,120
From when I was young,
before I moved to live with Aunt Aor,

544
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,680
people have always given me weird looks,

545
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,640
teased me, and…

546
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,799
They bullied you, right?

547
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,279
You've always been bullied…

548
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,200
to the point where you don't trust humans.

549
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,200
Is that right?

550
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,040
You must've been bullied
since you were a kid.

551
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,440
That's why you don't open up
to new friends.

552
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:04,160
How harsh was the bullying, Aylin?

553
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,839
That's not the point, Ton.

554
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:12,680
Bullying and harassment, harsh or not,

555
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:18,359
always leave scars on people.

556
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,440
Aylin.

557
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:30,480
Do you know that those
who bully and harass people

558
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,520
are not actually humans?

559
00:44:33,759 --> 00:44:36,799
What are they, Sun?

560
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:38,359
Germs, I guess.

561
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,839
Or garbage that should be gotten rid of.

562
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Exactly.

563
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,640
But the amount of this type
of garbage is excessive.

564
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
So, how should we fix that, Alpha?

565
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:56,600
I guess all we can do is not abandon
those who are bullied like Aylin.

566
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,080
Right. Do not abandon your friend.

567
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,839
What are you doing?

568
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,400
Doing what friends always do

569
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,839
when their friend is down.

570
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,839
There, there.

571
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,120
Don't cry.

572
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,879
We will protect you, Aylin.

573
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,240
From this moment on,
you don't have to be alone.

574
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:47,120
You can hang out and eat with me,
Tinh, and Charoen.

575
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,120
Though we are in different classes,
we can be friends.

576
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,400
Thank you, human friends.

577
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,799
Jeez, Ton.

578
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,000
Are you crying?

579
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,960
I think…

580
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,759
I feel inspired.

581
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,040
I will not run
the Mysterious Stories Club anymore.

582
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:33,920
What?

583
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,319
What will you do then?

584
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,839
I'll set up a club for those
who have been bullied.

585
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,400
-I'll be their spooksperson…
-Spokesperson!

586
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,080
Yeah, that.

587
00:46:56,799 --> 00:47:00,120
I'll be the spokesman
for people who've been bullied.

588
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,000
Because I

589
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,080
love everyone.

590
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,440
Hey. She's smiling because of you, Ton.

591
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,600
That's new.

592
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,560
That's a good thing, right?

593
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,440
I can make her smile.

594
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
A round of applause for the man, please.

595
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,440
Good job.

596
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,040
You did great.

597
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,200
Whose is it?

598
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:14,440
"I hope you're not too dense
to figure out."

599
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,160
"From your secret admirer."

600
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:20,799
Who is it?

601
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,440
But this seems familiar.

602
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:28,400
Flower.

603
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,480
"Dense."

604
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:34,319
Wait. Is this…?

605
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,440
Do you get it now?

606
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,240
Teacher Nida, you like me?

607
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,799
That dense person you like is me?

608
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,680
That's right.

609
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:55,759
That dense person is you, Teacher Bambam.

610
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:09,879
Will you tell me now
if I'm out of the friend zone?

611
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,879
But I don't have the cards with me now.

612
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,120
I'm not asking the cards. I'm asking you.

613
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,400
Why are you putting the flower
behind your ear?

614
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,680
I am blushing.

615
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,680
You're blushing.

616
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,720
Does that mean

617
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,920
you like me too?

618
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,839
I'm not sure.
I'm gonna go ask the cards first.

619
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,879
Hold on. Your cards are over here.

620
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:20,839
Stop.

621
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:23,879
Good job.

622
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,399
Slowly.

623
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,440
All right. One, two, three.

624
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:36,359
You've mastered it, rider.

625
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,200
I have a good teacher.

626
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,920
-Where is it?
-Right here.

627
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,560
Okay.

628
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,520
Thank you for seeing me off, Miss Sun.

629
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,040
It's the duty of a good girlfriend,
Miss Ongsa.

630
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,160
Your hair is all messy, rider.

631
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,240
Do you still like me with this messy hair?

632
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,200
It's too late to back off now, isn't it?
I like you with all my heart already.

633
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:18,240
Sun.

634
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:20,879
I have something to say.

635
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,600
What is it?

636
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,799
I want you to join
the US exchange program.

637
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,440
Why?

638
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,520
But I don't want to go anymore.

639
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,600
It's a whole year.

640
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:41,920
I can't bear it.

641
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,799
Sun.

642
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,040
I don't want you to throw away your dream.

643
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,960
Don't tie our relationship to this.

644
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,680
Why would you say that?

645
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,200
Don't get me wrong.

646
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,200
I just want you to follow your dream.

647
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,960
Realizing your dreams
is one kind of happiness.

648
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Will you be able to handle
us being apart for a year?

649
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,319
Is everything all right, girls?

650
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,560
Hello, Mrs. Aor.

651
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,560
Hi.

652
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,879
Is everything all right over here?

653
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,040
Did Ongsa do something to you?

654
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,040
No, I didn't.

655
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,560
We were just talking.

656
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,560
Sun, you should go home.

657
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,680
It's getting dark.

658
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,720
I'll get going then.

659
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,480
Hold on, Sun.

660
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,160
Would you like to have dinner with us?

661
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,640
Of course.

662
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,759
-Do you like the food, Sun?
-I do, sir.

663
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:46,399
Eat up.

664
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,799
Alpha and Aylin
won't be joining us for dinner.

665
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:50,960
Alpha has a study group

666
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,440
and Aylin is having dinner at Luna's.

667
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,279
Luna also asked us to join them

668
00:53:58,359 --> 00:54:02,600
but Ongsa didn't want us to be
a third wheel, so we turned her down.

669
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,759
Aylin and Luna?

670
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,319
Seriously?

671
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:16,279
Yes, ma'am.

672
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,520
Since when?

673
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,520
I think

674
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,759
your food is so delicious today.

675
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:23,720
Right, Dad?

676
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:26,720
Aylin and Luna are dating?

677
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,200
Why didn't I know that?

678
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,680
You and Alpha never told me.

679
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:36,080
No wonder why Luna has spent
the night here a lot lately.

680
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,319
That's the reason.

681
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:41,240
What about my girl, Ongsa?
Are you dating someone?

682
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,960
-It's me…
-No! I'm not.

683
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,399
I'm not dating anyone.

684
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,080
What?

685
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:56,240
Why would you say that?

686
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,720
What is it?

687
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,480
What's going on here?

688
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,279
So, you're never going to tell
your parents about me?

689
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,600
About what?

690
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,480
I'm not following.

691
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,680
Ongsa, are you keeping a secret?

692
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,960
Well…

693
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,120
Ongsa and I aren't just friends.

694
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,600
We're girlfriends.

695
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,799
Why are you saying that?

696
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:50,319
No, why are you doing this to me?

697
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,200
Sun.

698
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,080
Sun.

699
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,279
Sun, wait.

700
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,560
Sun.

701
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,520
Sun, wait.

702
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:17,359
Sun.

703
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,960
Sun!

704
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,240
All this time, I've been trying
to understand you, Ongsa.

705
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:53,440
I think we should call it off here.

706
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,319
The Earth without the Sun is not livable.

707
00:56:58,399 --> 00:56:59,480
What's the matter?

708
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,359
Sun doesn't love me, Alpha.

709
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,799
What the heck are you doing
in the middle of the field?

710
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,680
There's only one sun left now.

711
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,560
At least I'm visible to this sun.

712
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,960
Ongsa, are you out of your mind?
Don't run.

713
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,000
Whatever you need, you can tell us.

714
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,680
I need Sun back.

715
00:57:20,759 --> 00:57:22,120
Can you give me that?

716
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,480
Do you want Luangpu Sek's holy water?

717
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,480
No.

718
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:28,759
Sun.

719
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,640
If you don't want to see me, fine.
But I want to talk to you.

720
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,440
It's late. Let's go home.

721
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,799
You can come back tomorrow.

722
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:37,000
Ongsa.
