1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I heard you're talking to someone, Sun.
Is it the guy named Earth?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,840
Why are you doing this, human?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,560
I also like what you like.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,200
MORNING.

5
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:12,080
Ongsa, are you Earth?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,400
How should I feel about you, Ongsa?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I must admit that I'm not sure.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,599
That's why I'd like to
get to know you again.

9
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,119
Hi. I'm Sun.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,919
I'm Ongsa.

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,439
It's nice to meet you, Sun.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,640
Hi, Ongsa.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Hi, Sun.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,600
Dear Lord! Can Thailand be any hotter?

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,479
It's a fact of life.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,880
Where are you heading?

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,840
The library.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,160
Where are you heading, Ongsa?

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm going that way to buy some Kanom Krok.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,479
Okay. I'll see you later then.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,080
You go this way.

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,280
I'm gonna go this way.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,919
Okay. I'll go this way.

25
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,120
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
What was that? What's up with those two?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We were standing here together.
How would I know?

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,880
Damn it. Why is it so hot today?

29
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
It's like it's preparing me for hell.

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,000
I think because the weather is scorching,
people are going insane.

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,799
Screw it. It's hot out here.

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,480
Let's go to class and get some air-con.

33
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,440
Ongsa? Can I sit with you?

34
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Of course. Why wouldn't you be able to?

35
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,560
What's going on? Are you blushing?

36
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,479
No, I'm not.

37
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,359
Yeah? Then why are you afraid
to look at me?

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm not afraid.

39
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,039
If you aren't, look at me.

40
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:47,240
Why are you smiling?

41
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,640
Because you're cute, Ongsa.

42
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,640
Don't smile. You're making me flustered.

43
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,120
Why would you be flustered?

44
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,919
You're pretty smooth in the chat,
but super shy in person.

45
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,880
Honestly, this is quite new for us.

46
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Sun.

47
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,039
What's up?

48
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,799
Sorry, I'm not as chill in person
as I am online.

49
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Don't be. You're also cute this way.

50
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,239
I'll try to be more chill like this
when we're chatting.

51
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Can I have your phone?

52
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,599
Can I have your phone?

53
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
What's the passcode?

54
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,239
2-2-0-6.

55
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,359
We're using the same passcode.

56
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,960
Really?

57
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:39,919
What a coincidence.

58
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,719
Totally not a coincidence.

59
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:48,080
I set your birthday as my passcode.

60
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,080
Sun, wait a minute!

61
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,799
This is

62
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,960
my photo.

63
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,799
Do you like me that much?

64
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,200
Yes.

65
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,120
But I'm afraid you'll feel uncomfortable.

66
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,000
Just tell me if you feel uncomfortable.

67
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,719
I don't.

68
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,599
Should we take it slow?

69
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,560
I…

70
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,799
I don't want you to feel uneasy
around me either.

71
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,319
Here.

72
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,000
Do you want some Kanam Krok?

73
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,120
Is it Kanom Krok-Sun?

74
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Charoen.

75
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Charoen, you devil.

76
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
Cha-roen. Charoen!

77
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm talking to you, Charoen.

78
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,720
Why are you not talking to me?
Charoen, Charoen, Charoen.

79
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,680
Charoen.

80
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,079
Yes, Ongsa?

81
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Can we please switch seats?

82
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,280
Why?

83
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,600
Is it a bad feng shui there?

84
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,959
It's not like that.

85
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,439
I just want to have a different vision.

86
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,720
I could use a different vision too.

87
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,199
Thank you.

88
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
Here I am. Your new vision.

89
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,720
It's all right.

90
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,439
I'm ready to take down a demon.

91
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,839
Did you just imply I'm a demon?

92
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,120
-Yes.
-Take me down if you can.

93
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,160
Have you eaten?

94
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,280
Class.

95
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,439
I have an update on our Sports Day.

96
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,360
You're looking forward to it, right?

97
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,439
-Yes!
-We are.

98
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,319
This year, our class will be on Team…

99
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Team…?

100
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,959
Team…

101
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
Team…?

102
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,839
Team…

103
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,439
Team…?

104
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,160
Blue.

105
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,560
Yeah!

106
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Our main duties are making the props
and decorating the bleachers.

107
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,120
-Class president, please look into it.
-Yes, ma'am.

108
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,120
Does anyone want to be a cheerleader
or a drum major for Team Blue?

109
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,160
-I do.
-Me too.

110
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,640
Okay. Dear and Vi, stop by the recreation
department and write down your names.

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,760
That will be all from me.

112
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,839
Hey.

114
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,040
Don't you want to audition
for cheerleader?

115
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
Are you nuts? Me?

116
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,760
Why not?

117
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,439
I don't dance.

118
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,000
And I don't have guts.

119
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm also not pretty.

120
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,680
I'll just help with all the shit jobs.

121
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,160
That's right. I agree.

122
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,240
I'll just do nothing but look at hot guys.

123
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,920
What a dirty soul.

124
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
All you care about is men.

125
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Stop talking. Don't let me catch
you also eying someone up.

126
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,959
-You're sinful.
-What do you want to do?

127
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,959
-No, you're sinful.
-I'm not. You are.

128
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,600
-You're shameless.
-What? You did not just say that.

129
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,120
You're foul-mouthed. That's sinful.

130
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
What are you smiling at?

131
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,520
Smiling? I'm not.

132
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
-You're not?
-No.

133
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,880
"No"?

134
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,240
Lying is a sin.

135
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,439
I saw you smile just now.

136
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,719
No, I wasn't.

137
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,560
Thank you for taking me home.

138
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,199
Ongsa, will you help?

139
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,719
Step on it.

140
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,520
One, two, three.

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
You don't want to go home just yet?

142
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,000
No, I don't.

143
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,160
But it's dark.

144
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,959
I don't want you to get home late.

145
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,920
It's unsafe and inconvenient for you.

146
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,880
Whatever.

147
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,920
I will take you home no matter what.

148
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,959
But…

149
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
No buts.

150
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,800
Especially when it's late like this,
I must take you home.

151
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,040
And my house is just over there.

152
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,719
But I'm afraid
you might get into an accident.

153
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,319
Well then,

154
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,880
why don't you let me spend the night?

155
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,920
What?

156
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:37,040
What about your clothes?

157
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,480
I can just wash them.

158
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,280
And while you wait for them to dry?

159
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
Well,

160
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
I can wear your clothes.

161
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm blushing for my shirt.

162
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,079
I'm kidding.

163
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm blushing too, you know.

164
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,079
So,

165
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,839
can I crash here?

166
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,959
Luna, where are you going?

167
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,160
Can you please let me spend
a few nights at your house?

168
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
My house?

169
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,880
This annoying human senior
likes to make me do things her way.

170
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm helping Aylin
with Sports Day stuff for her team.

171
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,400
I want Aylin to help her classmates,

172
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,199
but I don't trust her to do it on her own.

173
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,000
So, I'm here to keep watch.

174
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
And you two humans…

175
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,319
Are you girlfriends now?

176
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,560
Hey! No. It's not like that.

177
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,199
What's this assembly in front of my house?

178
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:03,800
Hey, Luna.

179
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
-Good evening, sir, ma'am.
-Hi there.

180
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,319
-We're talking about…
-Hey!

181
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,800
It's nothing.

182
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,120
Luna is spending the night here

183
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,920
to make sure Aylin takes part in
the Sports Day prep.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
See?

185
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,319
Aylin participates
in human activities now.

186
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,400
What? What was that?

187
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:34,599
Yes. We must celebrate. For Aylin.

188
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,880
Then I will throw you guys
a feast tonight.

189
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,360
I'm gonna go help my mom cook.

190
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,920
Hold on.

191
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,920
Come here.

192
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,359
Not so fast, little sis.

193
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,719
I heard something.

194
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,599
Are you two…

195
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:12,880
girlfriends?

196
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,479
Uh, well…

197
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,319
About that, you can ask Ongsa.

198
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm gonna leave now. Bye.

199
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,640
Ride safe, Sun.

200
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,079
Now. Tell me everything.

201
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,079
It's…

202
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,479
What's that?

203
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:43,560
This kid.

204
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,439
Come on in.

205
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,160
Ongsa!

206
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,760
So that's what it's all about.

207
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,040
You were depressed
and disappeared because of Sun.

208
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:03,439
Alpha, I'm sorry
for not telling you anything.

209
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,800
Next time, fill me in, okay?

210
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm actually annoyed

211
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,599
that my friend knows more
about my sister than I do.

212
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,639
Hey. Ongsa told me not to say anything.

213
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,240
Right. I asked Luna not to tell.

214
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,040
I was afraid you'd yell at me.

215
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,200
I'd yell because
you didn't tell me things.

216
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,680
You're lucky nothing bad happened.

217
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
So, what's up with you and Sun?

218
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,440
Exactly.

219
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
You like each other.
You have feelings for each other.

220
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,520
But you're not girlfriends.

221
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,360
Are you guys in a talking stage?

222
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,520
I think we're beyond a talking stage.

223
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,720
Are you, like, seeing each other?

224
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
Not yet.

225
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,040
So, what kind of
relationship status is it?

226
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,000
Then let's just call it a "question-mark"
relationship status, human.

227
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,879
I don't get why
you two are being unclear about it.

228
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:29,080
If you like or love each other,
put it out in the open.

229
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,600
Why are you hiding it?

230
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm afraid people will badmouth Sun.

231
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Besides, Sun has never dated girls before.

232
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,440
Are you saying that you're afraid

233
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,200
that people will have a low opinion of Sun
if she dates a girl?

234
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,720
And I'm not sure

235
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,280
that I'm good enough for her.

236
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,520
Sometimes I even think
Sun doesn't tell anyone

237
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,600
because I'm not good enough.

238
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,520
Don't say things like that.
Why wouldn't you be good enough?

239
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,679
Right. And Sun would never have
that kind of thought.

240
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,520
You're the one who knows her best.

241
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Then what should I do?

242
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,200
Why did you take me here?

243
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
Ongsa.

244
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
-Come.
-Sit down.

245
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,000
I heard from my pals that you,
my ex-girlfriend,

246
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,800
feel unconfident about your looks.

247
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:58,840
What?

248
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,800
I…

249
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:05,399
I will boost your self-confidence,

250
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,440
self-assurance,

251
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,840
self-esteem,

252
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,240
and self-love.

253
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,760
Huh?

254
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:15,840
So, what's your plan?

255
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,919
-I'll get her on the palanquin.
-What?

256
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,720
What palanquin?

257
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,840
Team Blue is still looking for
a pretty girl

258
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
who will wear Thai traditional dress
and sit on the palanquin.

259
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm gonna be your mentor

260
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,760
on your road to being the school star
on Sports Day, sweetheart.

261
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,520
Ton, no. Let's not do that.

262
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
I can't do it, Ton.

263
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,280
But I can.

264
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,520
Ta-da!

265
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,159
Are you going to war, Ongsa?

266
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,040
We aren't stationed
at a historical war outpost.

267
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Change the outfit, honey.

268
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,960
Now. Go.

269
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
Damn it.

270
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Lift her hair on that side.

271
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,360
-What?
-You're burning me.

272
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,040
Luna, don't you burn my sister.

273
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,560
-It was you.
-It was you.

274
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,639
Here we go.

275
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,639
Damn.

276
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,679
She looks like a banana tree ghost.

277
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,520
We're all set.

278
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,639
Luna!

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,919
-You said straight hair.
-I said curls.

280
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,040
You said straight hair.

281
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,919
-What are you talking about? I said curls.
-No, we had an agreement.

282
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,120
"Curl it" is what I said.

283
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,919
We're in the theme "Colorful" this time.

284
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,520
Every color is here.
Blue, yellow, green, and red.

285
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,520
But Ongsa is on Team Blue.

286
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,480
Go change.

287
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,520
-This is blue right here.
-And what is this color?

288
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Go change. Change.

289
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Okay. Let's start on this side.

290
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,520
Ongsa.

291
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,520
Ton, what are you doing?

292
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,760
I'm training Ongsa to be a school star.

293
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,320
You know how to do makeup?

294
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
Don't worry, Sun.

295
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,240
For Ongsa, I can do just about anything.

296
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,879
All right, Ton. I brought clothes
of every color from the art room.

297
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
You can choose.

298
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,679
Goodness! None of these colors is pretty.

299
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,360
-Go change.
-None of them are pretty?

300
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,720
No. Go change.

301
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,040
-Damn it.
-Why don't you go get what you want?

302
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,800
Hey, Sun.

303
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,280
What's wrong?

304
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You seem kind of mad.

305
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,240
No.

306
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm not mad.

307
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,560
Good then.

308
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,760
Can you help us pick the costume
for Ongsa?

309
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,720
Come on.

310
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,399
-Come.
-Sure.

311
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,240
Which one should we go with?

312
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,200
Sun, is something wrong?

313
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,360
You look stressed.

314
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,080
No, nothing is wrong.

315
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,159
I'm fine.

316
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,679
CLASS 6: NIDA'S MINIONS

317
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,439
IS THAT TON AND ONGSA?

318
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,639
-YES!
-ARE THEY GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

319
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,439
WAIT A MINUTE!

320
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,399
Goodness gracious!

321
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Sun, what's going on?

322
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Nothing.

323
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,919
There was a mosquito. So I hit it.

324
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
It was annoying.

325
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,000
You hit it so hard
even its soul must have been squished.

326
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,040
The Sun is burning strangely hot today,
don't you think?

327
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
Hot weather today.

328
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,679
Do you think?

329
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,439
Yeah? More like hot-headed.

330
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,639
What?

331
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:56,639
I mean

332
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,399
the weather is so hot that
my head feels hot too.

333
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,600
Right?

334
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,000
It's hot.

335
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,639
Ongsa, let me see the brows
Ton drew for you.

336
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,720
I think they look weird.

337
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,080
Next time, let me do your brows for you.

338
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,560
And from now on,

339
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:38,919
don't let anyone draw your brows for you
except me.

340
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,480
Got it?

341
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,639
Do you think

342
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,520
I can be the one on the palanquin
on Sports Day?

343
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
I don't feel confident anymore.

344
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,040
Of course you can.

345
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,000
You're beautiful and cool.

346
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You will kill
in a Thai traditional costume.

347
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,439
Ongsa, sweetheart.

348
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
Oops.

349
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,560
Sorry, Sun.

350
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,159
Can you please make room for me?

351
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,040
Scoot over.

352
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Scoot over now.

353
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,760
Thank you.

354
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
All right. Ongsa.

355
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,919
Trust me.

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,560
Team Blue is going the win
the Best Parade award.

357
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,600
You're exaggerating.

358
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:38,960
So?

359
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,040
My heart truly believes that
you're the most beautiful girl.

360
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,360
Ongsa!

361
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,520
Crash at my place tonight.

362
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,000
Ongsa.

363
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's get to class.

364
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:14,520
Come.

365
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:35,879
What do I do?

366
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm freaking nervous!

367
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,800
Ongsa.

368
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,439
Here. Let me try putting makeup on you.

369
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,399
All right.

370
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,720
What makeup tones do you like?

371
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,919
Orangish or pinkish?

372
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,120
Crap.

373
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,679
What are orangish and pinkish?

374
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,080
I don't know.

375
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,439
You pick.

376
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Okay. I'll do what I feel like.

377
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,800
I want you to be confident.

378
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,040
About what?

379
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,120
About yourself.

380
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,320
I don't want you
to feel inferior to anyone.

381
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,000
You're a beautiful,

382
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
cute,

383
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,879
and very good person.

384
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,600
But I don't know
if I'm good enough for you.

385
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,600
You are who you are

386
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,840
and that's more than enough for me.

387
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,199
Let's add more.

388
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
This is my favorite lipstick.

389
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,360
Yeah?

390
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,600
Nice color.

391
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,879
Let me put it on you.

392
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,560
I…

393
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,280
I haven't fed Latte yet.

394
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,720
I don't think I can crash here tonight.

395
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,800
I should go home.

396
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Ongsa.

397
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,120
Here, take it.

398
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,600
It's okay. It's yours.

399
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,399
But it looks better
on your lips than mine.

400
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,719
Thank you.

401
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,280
Should I take you home?

402
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,240
Oh, no, it's fine.

403
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,600
It's just nearby.

404
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
I can manage.

405
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,600
Oh, I forgot.

406
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,480
Bye.

407
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,959
Goodnight.

408
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,600
Bye-bye.

409
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,879
Let's get on TikTok.

410
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,280
Sun One Day Vlog.

411
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,520
Swoosh!

412
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,199
-Does Dear look kind of different today?
-What are you doing?

413
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
Shit. Ongsa's got a new look.

414
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,480
Wow, Ongsa.

415
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,199
What happened?

416
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,840
Is something wrong, guys?

417
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:29,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

418
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,560
Ongsa.

419
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,639
You look drop-dead gorgeous today, girl.

420
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,080
-What an overstatement.
-It's true.

421
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,959
What's your lipstick? It's so pretty.

422
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,000
Well…

423
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,719
Sun gave it to me.

424
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,199
-Ton.
-Hi, Ton.

425
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,679
How are you, Ton?

426
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,040
Ongsa, sweetheart.

427
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,719
The bougainvilleas are blooming.

428
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,839
So, I took some for you.

429
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,279
Ton, can I ask you something?

430
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:21,239
Of course, Dear.

431
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:24,239
Are you really hitting on Ongsa?

432
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,400
Please give me time to think.

433
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,120
Let's just say that
Ongsa is special to me.

434
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,560
Ton, people might get the wrong idea.

435
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,920
How can they get the wrong idea?

436
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,120
You really are special to me.

437
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
Thank you very much, Ton.

438
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Charoen.

439
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,319
Are you leaving?

440
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,520
Are you going to your class now?

441
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,360
That's right.

442
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,279
Come on, Tinh.

443
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,720
I'll see you later then.

444
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,600
-Ton, I love you.
-Ton!

445
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,759
See you, guys.

446
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,520
-Bye, Ton.
-Bye.

447
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,880
Ton!

448
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,080
What do you want to eat?

449
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,400
I should grab something to eat
after all my gaming.

450
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,400
Charoen, you're supposed to
make them even.

451
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
How about you do it yourself?

452
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,680
My duty is to make the pom poms.
Yours is to cut, so cut.

453
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,440
Do your job.

454
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,480
Ongsa? Are you okay?

455
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,480
Sun's been acting weird all day.

456
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
Do you know why, human?

457
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,759
-I think I know.
-Know what?

458
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,279
Sun doesn't like my new look.

459
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,960
I did it the way she taught me.

460
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,520
I wore the lipstick.

461
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
I did my hair.

462
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
Ongsa. Where are you going?

463
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:15,799
The bathroom.

464
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
So, she still has no clue Sun is jealous?

465
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,319
Damn. It's so obvious.
Even someone living on Mars could tell.

466
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,200
True.

467
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,960
The jealousy is brighter than xenon light.

468
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,920
Exactly.

469
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,240
It's clearer than the facts of life.

470
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,520
Humans are the cleverest
sentients on earth.

471
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,120
But sometimes,
they can be unbelievably stupid.

472
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,520
Hey, Aylin.

473
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,920
Aren't you on Team Green?

474
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,000
Why don't you go help your team?

475
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,799
Tinh.

476
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,640
I like this team.

477
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,319
Me too.

478
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
Mawin, where are Ton and Alpha?

479
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,520
They're rehearsing
their Sports Day opening speech.

480
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,040
Where is Ongsa?

481
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,040
She isn't here yet?

482
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,960
Human Aunt dropped her off
at four in the morning.

483
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,319
Guys.

484
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,480
-Ongsa.
-Whoa.

485
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,400
Is it not okay?

486
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,279
No!

487
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,480
It's not okay?

488
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
No one is more beautiful than you today.

489
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,720
You're killing it, girl.

490
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,880
Let's take some photos.

491
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,040
Hold on, Tinh.

492
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,240
Sure. Come on. Everyone, gather round.

493
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,319
Okay.

494
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,560
One, two, three.

495
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,200
One, two, three.

496
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Change your pose. One, two, three.

497
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,560
-Wow.
-You're stunning and charming.

498
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,359
You're so graceful, my lady.

499
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,680
Thank you.

500
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:52,200
Ongsa, you look good
in Thai traditional costume.

501
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,640
That's true. Trust me.

502
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,080
With you on the palanquin,
Team Blue is going to win.

503
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,600
In this Thai costume,
you look prettier than usual, human.

504
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,520
Thank you, Aylin.

505
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,000
You look gorgeous today, Ongsa.

506
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,279
Does it suit me?

507
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,319
It does.

508
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
So pretty.

509
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,799
Good luck today.

510
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,480
Hello, Ongsa.

511
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,720
Can I snap your photo for the school page?

512
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,440
Are you sure?

513
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,040
Please do. Snap all the photos you need
and pick the nice ones to post.

514
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,799
-You do it, Tong.
-Sure.

515
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Excuse me. Can you just…

516
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,640
-Let's move, guys.
-Move.

517
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,720
Look at the camera, Ongsa. Okay.

518
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,560
One, two, three.

519
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,279
-Can I get one more from the side?
-Let us help with that.

520
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,480
-You can start.
-This side, okay?

521
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,839
Turn a bit to the side.

522
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,080
Look at the camera. Okay.

523
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,880
Smile. Okay.

524
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,200
Thank you, Ongsa.

525
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,000
And since I'm from the PR team,
I'd like to announce

526
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,000
that I'm single.

527
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,400
-See you.
-Okay.

528
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:52,839
Sun, are you okay?

529
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,279
Sun.

530
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,400
What's the matter?

531
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,279
Nothing. I'm all right.

532
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm fine.

533
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,080
Can I get a photo with you, Ongsa?

534
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,279
Yes.

535
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,640
One, two, three.

536
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,560
Thank you.

537
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,560
Ongsa, you look stunning.

538
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,759
A photo with us, please.

539
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:25,319
Do you have an IG account?
I'd like to follow you.

540
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,200
-Ah, sure.
-Our friend is famous.

541
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,200
-Here.
-Ongsa!

542
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:38,400
Come on. Time to form the parade.

543
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,359
You look gorgeous today.
Like, lethally gorgeous.

544
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,480
-Come on. Time to go.
-Guys, don't forget to dance your ass off.

545
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,080
-You can do it.
-Don't embarrass our class.

546
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,040
I'll see you later.

547
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,359
-Let's go, Ongsa.
-See you.

548
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,400
Get it, girl.

549
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,680
Sun.

550
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,080
Easy there, okay?

551
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:08,520
You're ruining your Kanom Krok.

552
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,560
Let them be ruined.

553
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,120
Take a deep breath.

554
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,120
It'll help calm you down, Sun.

555
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,160
What's the problem, human Sun?

556
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
You seem frustrated.

557
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:30,080
I don't like Ongsa like this.

558
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,359
Like what?

559
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,160
Too pretty.

560
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:37,920
Too gorgeous to handle.

561
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,279
Isn't it good?

562
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,319
It's not like it's bad.

563
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:51,120
But when she turns pretty,
other people want to get to know her.

564
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,720
They want to approach her.

565
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,000
They want to hit on her.

566
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,319
And then there's Ton.

567
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,160
Are you afraid Ton and Ongsa
will get back together?

568
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,080
But it's not wrong, is it?

569
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,920
He has the right.

570
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,720
Ton is single.

571
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:17,440
Ongsa is single too, right?

572
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,600
-Yeah?
-Right.

573
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,759
That's right.

574
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,359
It's not against the precepts.

575
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,480
We won because we danced
our asses off, for sure.

576
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:48,240
Team Yellow danced pretty well,
but we were better.

577
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,600
Agree.

578
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,759
Ongsa.

579
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,720
Guys.

580
00:44:55,799 --> 00:44:57,920
-Hello, Alpha.
-Hi.

581
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:02,200
That's my little sister. Good job.
I watched you the whole time.

582
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:06,080
I told you Team Blue would win.

583
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:10,359
Ongsa, you're the best. Congratulations.

584
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,920
No. I didn't do anything.

585
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,200
We should thank those
who designed the parade.

586
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,480
To me, you're the best no matter what.

587
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,920
Should we take photos together
just to capture the memory?

588
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,440
-Every one of us.
-Let's do it.

589
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,799
Nack! Can you help take pictures for us?

590
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:29,520
Here.

591
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,200
Let's pose.

592
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,200
One, two…

593
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:36,200
Hold on one second!

594
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:37,759
Ton is coming.

595
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,040
Stop. Just stop.

596
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,759
Move.

597
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,080
Hey!

598
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,759
Sorry.

599
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:49,600
I just want to stand next to Ongsa.

600
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,520
Ready?

601
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,799
One, two, three.

602
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,720
One more.

603
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,920
One, two, three.

604
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,480
Cool. Thanks a lot.

605
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,720
How'd it turn out?

606
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:13,240
Ongsa, can we steal the trophy for a bit?

607
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,440
This background is nice.

608
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,920
Again?

609
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,960
I'm gonna go change.

610
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,960
You can go home.

611
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
I don't know how long it will take.

612
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,319
It's all good. I can wait.

613
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,640
I'll take you home.

614
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:32,160
-Go.
-Thank you.

615
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,839
-And then we…
-Ongsa.

616
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,640
Should we celebrate with BBQ Pork tonight?

617
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,520
My treat.

618
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,359
Sure. Who else is going?

619
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,720
Just the two of us.

620
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:51,200
Why just us?

621
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:57,120
Because I want to spend time
with someone I love.

622
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,720
Ton.

623
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,640
I don't like it
when you get close to Ongsa.

624
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,480
She is taken.

625
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,400
What?

626
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,640
Ongsa, are you taken?

627
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,680
Since when?

628
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,839
Since now.

629
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,200
She is mine.

630
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:25,960
Remember this, Ton.

631
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,319
Ongsa belongs to Sun

632
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,120
and Sun only.

633
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:34,879
Excuse me.

634
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,560
Come on.

635
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,359
Sun.

636
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,799
What did you just…?

637
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,359
How do you feel toward Ton?

638
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,120
What?

639
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,359
I asked how you feel toward Ton.

640
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,000
Well…

641
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,600
He's a good big brother
who always helps me.

642
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,319
Are you getting back together with him?

643
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,480
-What?
-Well, you're single.

644
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,000
Are you going back to him?

645
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,040
What about me?

646
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,680
Sun, I think you're misunderstanding…

647
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,920
I don't know what you think of him.

648
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,839
But I like you.

649
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,400
I like you so, so much.

650
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,160
I don't think I can like you more.

651
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,680
I want to be your girlfriend.

652
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,480
I don't like when other people
get close to you.

653
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,839
I don't like it
when other people touch you.

654
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,440
I want the right to be possessive.
To be jealous.

655
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,000
And I want you for my own.

656
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,799
I already spoke my mind.

657
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,040
What do you want to do?

658
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,160
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

659
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,279
Ongsa.

660
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,400
I like you, Sun.

661
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,000
I like you so much.

662
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,120
I've liked you
since before we knew each other.

663
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,000
And I'm not sure
I'm good enough to be with you.

664
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,799
But I want to be your girlfriend.

665
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,440
And I want you to be my girlfriend.

666
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,440
Will you be my girlfriend?

667
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,680
I asked you first.

668
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:28,520
You can't just ask me back.

669
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:31,960
What's your answer?

670
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,960
I will.

671
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,640
Of course I will.

672
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,720
Finally.

673
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:56,319
Sun and Ongsa like each other?

674
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
Yes.

675
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,399
I'll fill you in later. Okay?

676
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,399
My plan has been completed.

677
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,680
My sweetheart
has finally found her happy ending.

678
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,399
Please. You can't call her
your sweetheart anymore.

679
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,879
-Respect her girlfriend, will you?
-Yeah.

680
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,720
Yeah, that's true.

681
00:51:17,399 --> 00:51:20,960
From now on,
she should be called Sun's sweetheart.

682
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,680
Ongsa, my sweetheart.

683
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:25,960
Hey!

684
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,480
Sun's sweetheart.

685
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,560
She's all grown up.

686
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:36,560
So, we're girlfriends now?

687
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,240
-Great job!
-Good job!

688
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,920
Well done!

689
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,799
This Friday night,

690
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:15,040
I'm hosting a meteor shower watch party
at the school.

691
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,640
Any couple who watches meteor showers
together at school

692
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,640
will be lucky in love.

693
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,240
When people are in a relationship,
they go on dates.

694
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,879
The first date is mostly watching a movie,
and it should be a romantic movie.

695
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Yes! Shoot him! Aim and kill!

696
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,000
Well, that was unexpected.

697
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,200
So, this is how aliens ask someone
to watch stars with them?

698
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:43,000
It's cute.

699
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,759
It's almost time.

700
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,319
Why are the kids not here yet?

701
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:49,640
We can just watch the stars together then.

702
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,040
Luangpu, can you enlighten us on

703
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,080
how people in a relationship should act?

704
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,440
Do you think I'm a love guru or what?

705
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,000
Why did you come to me
regarding love issues?
