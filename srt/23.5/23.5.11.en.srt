1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,160
Ongsa, do you think one year
is a long time?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,439
I think it is.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,040
It's long enough
for many things to change.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,479
Why do you ask?

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,719
I'm thinking about taking a test
for the US exchange program scholarship.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,279
What did you say?

7
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,400
Ongsa, are you keeping a secret?

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,200
So, you're never going to tell
your parents about me?

9
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,280
I knew

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,359
that you'd be here.

11
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,519
Sun.

12
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,799
Sorry for what?

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm sorry for telling my parents…

15
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
that you're just a friend.

16
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,160
That's all?

17
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,720
Isn't that what you're mad about?

18
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,160
All this time…

19
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,959
I've been trying to understand you, Ongsa.

20
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,119
When I found out that you were Earth,

21
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,119
I should've been furious.

22
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,320
I should've even hated you
for lying to me.

23
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,320
But I forgave you…

24
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,920
because I already loved that person.

25
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,679
Whether it was Earth

26
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
or Ongsa,

27
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,039
a guy

28
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,719
or a girl,

29
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,120
it didn't matter.

30
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,400
I was already in love with that person.

31
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,240
Do you get me?

32
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,440
You asked for more time…

33
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,120
because you didn't want other people
to know we were together.

34
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,880
No matter how much I wanted it
to be in the open…

35
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,440
I agreed.

36
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,840
I did, even though I didn't care…

37
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,520
what other people thought of me
in the first place.

38
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,120
To me, us being together…

39
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,400
isn't something to be ashamed of.

40
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,800
As for the scholarship in the US…

41
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,719
I actually wanted you to come with me.

42
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,919
But I understood that you couldn't.

43
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,120
So, I chose not to go.

44
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,039
I decided to stay
so that I could spend time with you.

45
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:20,799
I know that following my dreams
is one kind of happiness.

46
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,599
But spending time with you…

47
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,599
also makes me happy.

48
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,039
I got up the guts
to tell my parents that I love you.

49
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,200
Do you know why?

50
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,599
Because I wanted them to know…

51
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,840
that there was someone good by my side.

52
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:21,960
I did my best at everything for you.

53
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,719
But why, Ongsa?

54
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,599
You act like…

55
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,200
what I've done is silly.

56
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,919
You act like our love is embarrassing.

57
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,200
It's not like that.

58
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,039
I didn't tell my parents

59
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,840
because I was afraid…

60
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,880
that they wouldn't accept us.

61
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,039
If that was the case,

62
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
it would be hard for you.

63
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,599
As for the exchange program abroad,

64
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,760
I really can't go with you.

65
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,559
But I don't want to hold you back
from following your dream.

66
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,079
I want you to do…

67
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
what you initially wanted.

68
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,040
Also, I hid our relationship…

69
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,120
because I was afraid

70
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,880
that people would criticize you…

71
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,400
for being with someone like me.

72
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
All the things you just said,

73
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,600
all the decisions you made,

74
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,280
you never asked me
if I was okay with them.

75
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,520
You always think for me.

76
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,920
You've never once asked for my input.

77
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,160
But somehow…

78
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm always the first…

79
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,600
to get hurt by you.

80
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,280
Sun.

81
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,439
What are you doing?

82
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,959
Let's just call it off.

83
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Ongsa?

84
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,319
Are you okay?

85
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,599
Can we talk later?

86
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Of course, dear.

87
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,959
We can talk later.

88
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,040
Thank you.

89
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,079
I'll go talk to her.

90
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,240
What should I do?

91
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,079
Sun. Sun…

92
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,400
It's okay, Ongsa. It's okay.

93
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,400
She doesn't want to be with me anymore.

94
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,120
I didn't mean for things
to turn out this way, Alpha.

95
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,479
It's okay, Ongsa.

96
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,240
It's all right.

97
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Just let it out.

98
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,719
Why are you giving me your pork, Mawin?

99
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,839
Because I know you like it.

100
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,079
Eat up.

101
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,360
Charoen, you should eat up too.

102
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,199
It's my meatless day today.

103
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,719
Humans.

104
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,719
Can I sit with you guys?

105
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,800
-Of course.
-Sit down. Take a seat.

106
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
-Come here, Aylin.
-Thank you.

107
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,199
"Thank you."

108
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,400
Hello, human senior Ton,
human senior Mawin.

109
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,920
Hi.

110
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Hello, Luna's girlfriend.

111
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, look. These single-ass people
are teasing us.

112
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,760
-Wow.
-That hurts.

113
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:18,760
Human senior, stop being clingy.

114
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,000
-Stop that cutesy voice too.
-Why?

115
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,599
-Don't bump your head against mine.
-But I want to.

116
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,199
People in love are making me jealous.

117
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,640
Right? When will we have what they have?

118
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,479
I would love to volunteer, sweetie.

119
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,280
Eat properly.

120
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,880
-Eat up. Just stuff yourself.
-No.

121
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,400
You cling to her like a monkey.

122
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Hey, Sun.

123
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,920
-Hey.
-Hey.

124
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,839
Eat with us.

125
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,240
Sit down. Take a seat.

126
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,959
I'm eating with Dear and the girls today.

127
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,199
Ah. Okay.

128
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,079
Why isn't she sitting with us today?

129
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
She always does.

130
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,399
Right.

131
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,079
Ongsa.

132
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,800
You all right?

133
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,520
Ongsa and Sun broke up.

134
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,560
-What?
-What?

135
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
How is that possible?

136
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,680
How come?

137
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,800
Tinh, what are you thinking about?

138
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,080
About something I can't quite figure out.

139
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,360
What are you talking about?

140
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,600
Do you think love is sustainable?

141
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,879
I think it is.

142
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,080
People say that love is the engine
that keeps lives going.

143
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,679
Whoa.

144
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Do we need to be so reliant on love?

145
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,760
It's just what I heard.

146
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:41,919
Honestly, I don't understand it either.

147
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,720
But my mom said that love
has an expiration date.

148
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,800
Like the love Dad gave Mom.

149
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,600
Once it expired,

150
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,960
they got divorced.

151
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
So the answer to your question is

152
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,280
love isn't sustainable, right?

153
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,399
I guess so.

154
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
But I don't think that applies

155
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,280
to Ongsa and Sun.

156
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,919
What do you mean?

157
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,840
Maybe even though your love
hasn't expired yet,

158
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,720
if you don't understand each other,

159
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,440
you still break up anyway.

160
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,280
Tinh, you're so cool.

161
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,960
Why the compliment all of a sudden?

162
00:19:56,399 --> 00:20:01,960
Your thoughts about love are so cool.

163
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,120
No wonder I like you.

164
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,919
What kind of "like" is that?

165
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,840
The kind that…

166
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
has no expiration date.

167
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
Though you like me as a brother,

168
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,840
I will like you this way forever.

169
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,560
Hey!

170
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,840
You again, Ton?

171
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,879
I picked a frangipani for you

172
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,159
because it's white and pure

173
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
just like your heart, Charoen.

174
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,320
But this flower is known
to be inauspicious.

175
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,560
Isn't that plumeria?

176
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,080
They're the same flower, Ton.

177
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, Ton. What are you doing here?

178
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,919
I'm here to hit on Charoen.

179
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,919
-What?
-What?

180
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,399
Ton! You like Charoenporn?

181
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,879
That's right.

182
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,399
Truly. Deeply.

183
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,560
Madly.

184
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,040
Then can I truly ask you a question?

185
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
Of course, Charoen.

186
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,399
What makes you like me?

187
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Everything about you.

188
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,520
Can you be more specific?

189
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:16,720
I like that you're a demure person.

190
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,840
Then you can also like Kongkwan.

191
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,480
She's more demure than I am.

192
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,879
But I like you
for your Dhamma-loving heart as well.

193
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,879
Then you can like a nun.

194
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,840
Why do you have to reject me so hard?

195
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,159
Because I don't understand
why you like me.

196
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,960
Love isn't easy like in romantic movies.

197
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,040
To me, love is like an art film.

198
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,200
How?

199
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,760
It's incomprehensible,
but you can tell it's good.

200
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:03,200
Wow. That's sharp.

201
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,720
Dear, Vi, Kongkwan,

202
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
am I heartbroken?

203
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:21,639
Why?

204
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
Why?

205
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,840
Why am I heartbroken?

206
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,960
Because you belong to everyone.
You shouldn't belong to just one person.

207
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,520
So that's what it is.

208
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,399
It's so hard to be me.

209
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,080
I love you all.

210
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,159
Don't look at her, human.

211
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
That's right.

212
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,360
Whatever you want, you can tell us.

213
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,120
I want Sun back.

214
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,399
Can you guys give me that?

215
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Tough one.

216
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,320
Do you want
Luangpu Sek's holy water instead?

217
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,760
No.

218
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,879
Let me console you.

219
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,040
I know a special spell
that can heal the downhearted.

220
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,240
What spell?

221
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,520
Hands.

222
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Susu sasa patangka patangki.

223
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
Susu sisi patangki patangka.

224
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,840
Why does your spell sound familiar?

225
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,600
Do you feel better?

226
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,520
I guess I do.
And your spell smells quite nice.

227
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
What kind of spell has a smell?

228
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,040
The kind that comes from this
seven-souled centipede lozenge.

229
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:56,760
It's my family's product.

230
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,159
It consists of Siamese cassia,
sickle senna,

231
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,760
sacred lotus, star fruit, papaya…

232
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,840
A forced proximity scene.

233
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,679
The main character is walking towards us.

234
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:36,919
Sun.

235
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:57,960
Damn. That hurt.

236
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,399
She's in a terrible state of shock.

237
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,520
Look after her.

238
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,120
I have class.

239
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,560
Hey. Aylin.

240
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
Aylin. Stay.

241
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,800
It's okay, Ongsa.

242
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,800
Let's just go.

243
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,520
The teacher might get mad.

244
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,520
Let's go retrieve the ball.

245
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,959
Why are you doing this, Ongsa?

246
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
Doing what?

247
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,000
Do you really think I don't see you?

248
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,840
You go up the rooftop.

249
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,480
The Earth without the Sun is not livable!

250
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,280
Hey, Ongsa.

251
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,080
What's the matter?

252
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,959
Sun doesn't love me, Alpha.

253
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,360
You were acting unhinged,
trying to catch the sun out in the field.

254
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,720
There's only one sun left now.

255
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,919
At least I'm visible to this sun.

256
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,240
-The sun!
-Ongsa.

257
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,399
-The sun!
-Don't run.

258
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,439
-The sun!
-Stop.

259
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,520
And you've sent me 768 messages.

260
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,159
Have you been counting?

261
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,360
Seriously?

262
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,080
I feel bad.

263
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,480
I want to say I'm sorry

264
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:45,919
but I don't know what to do.

265
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,800
I've never been heartbroken before.

266
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,720
So you do what characters in movies
or music videos do?

267
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Right?

268
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,439
Do you not care

269
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,000
how your actions will make me feel at all?

270
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,199
How do you feel?

271
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,600
Look up.

272
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,560
I said look up.

273
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,199
Ongsa.

274
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,879
Do you have any idea…

275
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,080
how much I love you?

276
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:48,000
If you do,

277
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,000
then why did you choose to leave me?

278
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,919
Because you've never understood me.

279
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,600
Not even once.

280
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,959
You don't understand what I want.

281
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,720
What can I do to earn your forgiveness?

282
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:20,199
Can you please tell me?

283
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:39,919
I just want you to love me…

284
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,120
like I love you.

285
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,800
I love you too, so much.

286
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,080
How is that different?

287
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,240
You don't understand me.

288
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,159
You've never understood me at all.

289
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,040
Ongsa.

290
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,879
Your mom and I would like to have a word.

291
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm tired today.

292
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,080
Can we talk some other time?

293
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,399
It'll take just a minute.

294
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,560
Have a seat.

295
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,080
What is it?

296
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,560
Alpha and Aylin told us about you and Sun.

297
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:03,719
-Dad, Mom, I…
-Ongsa, my dear.

298
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,919
Don't worry.

299
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:09,759
We're not blaming you for that.

300
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,719
Aren't you guys upset that
I was seeing Sun?

301
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,159
Why would we be?

302
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,480
We are okay with whoever you like or love.

303
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,400
We want to say, though,

304
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,639
that we don't want this to happen again.

305
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,600
I don't want you to lie
or hide things from me.

306
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,799
I am sorry.

307
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:08,120
I did it because…

308
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,680
I was afraid…

309
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,799
that you would be alarmed.

310
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,799
I was afraid…

311
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:30,319
that you would be disappointed in me
because I like girls.

312
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,120
Why would we be disappointed?

313
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:41,680
Ongsa.

314
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:47,520
You can always talk to us directly
about anything.

315
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,799
Don't come up with things on your own.

316
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,799
I know you care a lot about other people,

317
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,440
but I want you to stop thinking for them.

318
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,600
Stop being afraid
of what other people think

319
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,360
and be more considerate of yourself
and the ones close to you.

320
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,880
Maybe you will see something
you overlooked before.

321
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,040
Human, stop thinking for others.

322
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,400
And stop acting weird

323
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,319
and go get Sun back.

324
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,680
I understand now.

325
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,600
Sun.

326
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,440
Sun, it's me, Ongsa.

327
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
Please come out and talk to me.

328
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Sun.

329
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,319
Sun, please come out and talk to me.

330
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,480
Sun, come downstairs, please.

331
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,240
You don't have to say anything.

332
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:18,759
You can just listen.

333
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
Sun. Talk to me.

334
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,839
Please.

335
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:28,799
Sun. I'm at your gate.

336
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,120
I'll be waiting here.

337
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,560
Please pick up the phone.

338
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,560
Sun!

339
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Sun!

340
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,839
I'll be waiting right here
until you come out.

341
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,480
Sun.

342
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,640
Ongsa.

343
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,880
Alpha. Why are you here?

344
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,400
I came to see how you were.

345
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,200
How's it going?

346
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,120
You haven't talked to her yet?

347
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:34,799
Is she ever gonna talk to me?

348
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
It's okay.

349
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:43,799
Though you don't succeed today,

350
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,920
you can always come back tomorrow.

351
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,120
What if I don't succeed tomorrow?

352
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:59,000
Ongsa, constant dripping…

353
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,240
Wears away a stone?

354
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:01,319
…makes a stone wet.

355
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,160
What kind of joke was that?

356
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,040
I don't want you to feel so down.

357
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,960
Sun is still mad.

358
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,880
She might not be ready to talk to you yet.

359
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,279
It's late. Let's go home.

360
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,880
You can come back again tomorrow.

361
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,400
Don't forget to bring mosquito repellent.

362
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,400
There are lots of them here.

363
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's go.

364
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:38,120
There's no point in standing here.

365
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,319
Come back again tomorrow, okay?

366
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,240
Come on.

367
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,200
Go home.

368
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,520
Ongsa.

369
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,560
You talk to her.

370
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,880
I'll wait at home.

371
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,000
I came

372
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,160
because I wanted to apologize to you.

373
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,720
I'm sorry for acting like a crazy person
these past few days.

374
00:41:44,759 --> 00:41:46,200
I was silly.

375
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,200
But I know now…

376
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,799
that what I did didn't fix what I am.

377
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,720
Do you realize now…

378
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,359
what the issue is?

379
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,120
We broke up…

380
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,400
because I cared too much
about other people's opinions.

381
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:22,839
I was so afraid
of what others would think or feel

382
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:26,759
that I overlooked the feelings
of someone close to me.

383
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,400
The most important person to me.

384
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:40,839
I was so afraid people would think less
of you for being with someone like me.

385
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,520
So afraid that I decided
not to tell my own parents.

386
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,640
You must've felt so hurt.

387
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,560
I am sorry.

388
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,279
But I know what you want now.

389
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,600
I…

390
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,000
want to love you.

391
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,279
I want to believe in our love.

392
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm sorry…

393
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,560
for not understanding you at all.

394
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm truly sorry.

395
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,799
Ongsa, I…

396
00:43:57,879 --> 00:43:59,160
Sun.

397
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,400
Please forgive me.

398
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,080
Please allow me back into your orbit.

399
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,879
Aunt Aor, Uncle Nop,

400
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,240
this human senior
would like to spend the night.

401
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:25,960
She is studying with human cousin.

402
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,240
Good evening.

403
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,040
I hope you don't mind me sleeping over.

404
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,200
Not at all.

405
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,440
Where is Alpha?

406
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,160
She's out helping human Ongsa
reconcile with human Sun.

407
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,279
Aren't you helping them?

408
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,879
Human cousin told me to wait for you here.

409
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:51,400
Alpha was right.

410
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,520
You wouldn't be of much use
even if you went.

411
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,799
Are you saying…

412
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,400
I'm useless?

413
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:13,120
Aunt Aor, Uncle Nop, human senior
isn't spending the night anymore.

414
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Hey. I was just kidding.

415
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:16,240
Don't touch me.

416
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
You guys are so sweet
an army of ants is heading our way.

417
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,279
Seeing them like this reminds me
of back when I was hitting on you.

418
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,200
Back when you gave me flowers every day?

419
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:31,319
Cheesy.

420
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,600
Hey, she came around because I did that.

421
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,960
Uncle Nop, you are the best.

422
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,600
You're my idol.

423
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:47,799
Aylin, wait for me.

424
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,400
Wait.

425
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,120
I've been studying for hours.
It's exhausting.

426
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,720
I feel sore.

427
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,400
I'm wondering if anyone here
wants to give me a massage.

428
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,000
Aylin, aren't you going to respond--

429
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,600
What?

430
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,839
She's out.

431
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,480
Are you really sleeping?

432
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,080
Aylin?

433
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,680
Are you asleep?

434
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,279
THAI GENERAL APTITUDE TEST 5

435
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Human senior, what are you doing?

436
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,839
So, you've been awake?

437
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,200
I was really asleep.

438
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:18,359
But then your loud noise woke me.

439
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,440
When did you wake up?

440
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,120
When you called my name.

441
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,279
You poked my cheek.

442
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:28,640
Then why did you pretend to be asleep
when you were already awake?

443
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,640
I wanted to know
what you were going to do.

444
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,400
Do you know it now?

445
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,520
Just keep reading
and stop getting distracted.

446
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,400
How was that me getting distracted?

447
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,440
You're a bad girl, human senior.
You took advantage of me.

448
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,000
It's not taking advantage if you're awake.

449
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,960
Yeah?

450
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,319
Yes.

451
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,759
You took advantage of me.

452
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,560
It's not taking advantage if you're awake.

453
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:19,640
So, this is how you wanna play it?

454
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,040
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

455
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,440
I don't believe you.

456
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,720
-You did that.
-I'm sleepy.

457
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,319
You're not sleepy.

458
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,879
Aylin, get up.

459
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,640
-Human senior, stop annoying me.
-You sneaky little girl.

460
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,120
I want to sleep.

461
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,759
Sun, are everything all right?

462
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:10,400
Well, last night, Ongsa came to see me.

463
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,000
She apologized.

464
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,279
Isn't that good?

465
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,560
It is good, but…

466
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:21,839
-But?
-But?

467
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,359
I'm so devoted to love.

468
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,600
I'm willing to do anything
or even change myself for someone I love.

469
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,960
But if one day I feel like my love
is stronger than hers,

470
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,600
or like I try harder than her,

471
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,839
like when I decided not to join
the exchange program for her,

472
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,560
I will be the one who ends up feeling bad.

473
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,040
Ongsa and I will fight.

474
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:00,960
Then, we will break up again.

475
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,839
I don't want to feel that way
about Ongsa again.

476
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:12,640
Sun, I understand your commitment to love.

477
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,399
But a healthy love should allow you
to walk together at the same pace.

478
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:22,520
You don't have to entirely change yourself
for the other person.

479
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,560
You don't have to change to the point
where you become someone else.

480
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,440
When you love someone,

481
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,319
you should love who they truly are.

482
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,359
That's right.

483
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
You can be yourself

484
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,520
but also find a well-balanced approach.

485
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,000
If you completely change yourself
to be loved,

486
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,319
one day, you'll feel so uncomfortable

487
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:50,879
that you'll no longer want
the other person in your life.

488
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,640
You should learn to love.

489
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,600
Learn to love without losing who you are.

490
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,120
So, what should I do?

491
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,000
Every relationship comes with conflicts.

492
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,799
Your mom and I
have been married for 20 years,

493
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,440
yet, as you see,
we're still very much in love.

494
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,240
If two people truly love each other,

495
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,799
they'll eventually find a way
to work through their problems together.

496
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:30,920
So, what do you two think I should do?

497
00:52:36,399 --> 00:52:38,520
I'd like you to think it through.

498
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,160
You don't have to choose just one path.

499
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:49,440
You can love Ongsa
and follow your dream at the same time.

500
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,799
Come on. Let's eat.

501
00:52:56,879 --> 00:52:58,319
The porridge is getting cold.

502
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,799
Sun.

503
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:22,960
Have you been waiting long?

504
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
Not really. I don't mind waiting anyway.

505
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,839
I miss the first time we met here.

506
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,359
Do you recall?

507
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,200
I do.

508
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:49,839
You gave me the bracelet.

509
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,399
Which is back on your wrist again.

510
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,640
Without it,
I feel like something is missing.

511
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,640
It's become important to me.

512
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,759
I'm glad to hear that it's important.

513
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:17,160
Everything you've given me is important.

514
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:30,319
Ongsa.

515
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,319
I'd like to say sorry.

516
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,440
Sorry for what?

517
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:41,759
For being silly too.

518
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,080
All I wanted was for you to understand me.

519
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,120
I expected you to be who I wanted,

520
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,720
but I didn't understand you at all.

521
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,600
I tried to change myself for you

522
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,960
because I thought that if I worked hard,

523
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,200
our love would carry on.

524
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,200
But I was wrong.

525
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:22,240
I was so attached to you
that you felt uncomfortable.

526
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,200
But I know now what is right.

527
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:33,120
Ongsa.

528
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:39,319
I want to join the US exchange program.

529
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,720
I want to follow my dream.

530
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,720
That's great.

531
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,040
I'm glad you've decided to do that.

532
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,080
I believe you can do it.

533
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,000
And you will be happy doing it.

534
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,120
Thank you, Ongsa.

535
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,160
Sun.

536
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,279
Is something wrong?

537
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,839
There's one thing…

538
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,399
that I'm not so sure about.

539
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:48,279
What is it?

540
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:52,440
If I get the scholarship…

541
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,200
I'll have to live there for a year.

542
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:01,319
It's far away.

543
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,319
It's too far for you to come and visit.

544
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,160
How will we be?

545
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,799
The exams are finally over!

546
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:41,240
We'll see each other less next year.

547
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:46,480
Will you promise to be this lovely Aylin
for me forever?

548
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,560
I got the scholarship. I will be an
exchange student in the US, Ongsa!

549
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:53,759
So you won't get to see her for a year.

550
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:58,120
Even if Sun were to live in outer space,
I'd find a way to contact her.

551
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,680
You promise, Sun?

552
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,919
I promise.

553
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,440
Let's shoot a video
to capture memories for Sun.

554
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,040
Every moment?

555
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,960
Every moment,
especially the romantic moments.
