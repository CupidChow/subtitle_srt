1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,960
This term, you have a new friend.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,160
My name is Sun.

3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,199
What's yours?

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,039
My name is Ongsa.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,160
Nice to meet you, Ongsa.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,360
She's even cuter in person than she is
in photos.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,959
Stay out of it!

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,119
Even on the toughest day,
something good can happen to you.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,400
It depends on how you look at it.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,959
Hey.

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,279
Are you related to Napatsanun Ampornsopon?

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
You mean Alpha?

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,960
Alpha and I are siblings.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
-What?
-What?

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,760
Why are you guys so surprised?

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,320
Alpha is a renowned student president

18
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:49,839
and a member of The Fixed Stars,

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,040
the most famous group in S-Tar.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,400
The center of our S-Tar universe is
a group called The Fixed Stars.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,839
The first member: Alpha.

22
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,400
A beautiful student president

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,640
who excels academically
and enjoys participating in activities.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,160
The second member is Ton,
everyone's sweetheart.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,160
-The most beloved man in S-Tar.
-Smile at the camera.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
-He's handsome and loves us all equally.
-Oh. Hi there, Jonathan.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Hi.

28
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,720
Then there's Luna,
a sweet-talker with musical talent.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,520
Everyone has a crush on her
regardless of gender

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,360
because she's the perfect combination
of ultimate beauty and coolness.

31
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,119
And lastly, there's Mawin,
the student vice president.

32
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,759
Damn it. It's glue.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,080
Sheesh, me again.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,440
There's nothing much to say.
Mawin is Mawin.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,759
It's super glue.

36
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,800
To be honest, I have no idea
how he ended up in The Fixed Stars.

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,880
So that is it. The Fixed Stars.

38
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,800
-So, Ton is a member of this group.
-Hey.

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,479
You know Ton?

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,759
That's not unusual.

41
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,399
No, it's not.

42
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,320
Because Ton belongs to everyone,
everyone knows Ton.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,239
S_SSUNSHINE HAS SENT YOU 4 MESSAGES

44
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,079
Ongsa, why are you being weird?

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm not!

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,880
Who's being weird?

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,680
"I'm not"? That was so high-pitched.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
Look at you.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,040
See?

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,239
You keep getting that.

51
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,000
It's just spam.

52
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,840
A phone scam gang.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,359
I hate them.
They send me messages every day.

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
Musavada veramani.

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,280
What does that mean?

56
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:58,519
I have no idea.

57
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,679
You have no idea?

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
Liar.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,640
Who are you talking to?

60
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,000
You're smiling.

61
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,799
Is some guy hitting on you?

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,040
Not telling. It's a secret.

63
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,359
Let's do our homework.

64
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,880
What did the teacher say
about this part again?

65
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,200
She said lying is bad.

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
Next week, you will choose
one club to join

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,359
depending on your interests.

68
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,080
The leader of each club will set up the
registration table on the ground floor.

69
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,039
Take a look and decide which one to join.

70
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,200
Which club are you guys joining this year?

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,719
We Love Ton Club.

72
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,520
Huh? What club?

73
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,800
The We Love Ton Club.

74
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,640
Which club are you two joining?

75
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,159
The Catch a Liar Club.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Is there such a club?

77
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,760
Yes.

78
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,359
We founded it just now.
Do you want to join?

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,240
It's okay.

80
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,520
That's not my thing.

81
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,159
Not your thing, huh?

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Ongsa has put up walls.

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,599
I guess we need more time.

84
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
More time to wait for her to open up?

85
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,039
Nope.

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,159
More time to pry.

87
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,680
@S_SSUNSHINE SENT A PHOTO

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,599
I found a stray cat
out the back of my house today.

89
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,919
Cute, right?

90
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,000
Little baby!

91
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,200
You're a cat servant too, sir?

92
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,320
I serve anything that's cute.

93
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:19,960
Well, then…

94
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
You must serve me too, Earth.

95
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
Why?

96
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,039
Because you said
you serve anything that's cute.

97
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,199
Enough.

98
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,160
Ongsa, enough.

99
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,360
Stop replying to her.

100
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,959
You will not reply to her.

101
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,560
You're not Earth.

102
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,400
You're not a guy.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,560
But Sun is so damn cute.

104
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,319
Whoa. You went quiet.

105
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,120
Don't you think I'm cute, Earth?

106
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,360
Well…

107
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:17,720
okay.

108
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,800
"Well, okay."

109
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
What does that mean?

110
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,720
LOL

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
You're messing with me. You will pay.

112
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,319
Human, do you have… that thing?

113
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:44,439
That thing…

114
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:45,959
What is it?

115
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,560
The thing human females use
when they are on their period.

116
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,959
Wait a minute.

117
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,839
Thanks, human.

118
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,560
Hold on.

119
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,959
Uh… well…

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,560
Can I get some advice about school clubs?

121
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Say it, human.

122
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,120
What club are you joining, Aylin?

123
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,839
I'm not joining human clubs.

124
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah? Does…

125
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,680
the school have an Astronomy Club?

126
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
They used to.
It was canceled a long time ago.

127
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,520
I heard human beings say that
the club was cursed.

128
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,040
Cursed? How?

129
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,959
Whoever joins that club will be hapless.

130
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,560
Was it that bad?

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,319
Some human schoolers at S-Tar almost died.

132
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,040
Seriously?

133
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,640
The only way to break the curse
is to leave the club.

134
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to use this.

135
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,719
Almost died?

136
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,480
We have lots of clubs in school.

137
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,839
I don't highly recommend them though.
They're mostly boring.

138
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,439
How about the Music Club?

139
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:27,560
I guess musical activities
aren't your cup of tea.

140
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,520
Let's move on.

141
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
Which club are you two joining?

142
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,079
There.

143
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,520
The Student Committee?

144
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,319
What will you do?

145
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
It doesn't matter

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,959
because that club is full of school stars.

147
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Tinh just wants to be
in the spotlight, Ongsa.

148
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,760
And which club are you joining, Charoen?

149
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,360
That club.

150
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,160
Hello, ladies.
Step in and check out my club.

151
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
THE MYSTERIOUS STORIES CLUB

152
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,480
There's only one rule in this club.

153
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,760
It's that I belong to everyone

154
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,959
and I love everyone.

155
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,680
Saranghae.

156
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,439
Saranghae.

157
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,280
Gosh! I'm blushing right now.

158
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,360
Should we go now?

159
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,719
-I'm hunting the spotlight.
-I'm hunting ghosts.

160
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
Let's go.

161
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,760
Hello, Ton.

162
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,360
Hey. Hello, cutie.

163
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Hi, Ongsa.

164
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:46,160
Are you interested in joining
the Floral Design Club?

165
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
I don't know.

166
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm walking around just to see.

167
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,240
Me too.

168
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,680
Do you want to walk with me?

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,560
S-sure.

170
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,719
Just help me. Stop complaining.

171
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,599
Mawin! Be careful.

172
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,199
Yes, Miss Luna.

173
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,240
Always ordering me around.

174
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,240
ANNUAL SCHOOL CLUB FAIR
S-TAR SCHOOL

175
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello, everyone.

176
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,040
Gather round. Come on!

177
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,319
I have good news.

178
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,599
After being canceled for five years,

179
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,040
today, our Astronomy Club is back.

180
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,760
What?

181
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,959
What the heck?

182
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
Join us for an outer space adventure

183
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,640
by meeting in the club room
behind the basketball court.

184
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,760
I promise you'll have fun…

185
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,680
It seems like the only one
having fun is her.

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,680
…if you join the club.

187
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
People are shaking their heads.

188
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,120
Everybody, please come.

189
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,120
Don't forget it.

190
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,640
Please come. Don't forget it.

191
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:55,959
Will she even make it?

192
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,439
It's been five years, guys.

193
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,160
Tinh just joined our club, by the way.

194
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
What?

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,040
Luna, are you sure that
the Astronomy Club can be opened?

196
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,839
Of course.

197
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
If I have more than four applicants,

198
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,599
the club will be reopened.

199
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,719
And the leader of the club will be me.

200
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,280
What about the Astronomy Club curse?

201
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,400
It's nothing, kids.

202
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,439
There are no superstitions in space.

203
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,640
Right?

204
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,040
Don't forget to come.

205
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,760
Please. Please come.

206
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,920
You promise?

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
Promise?

208
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,959
Ongsa, do you want to check out
the Astronomy Club?

209
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,520
-Are you interested?
-Guys, you're joining Mysterious Stories?

210
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,680
-Let's go and see.
-They aren't real.

211
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,719
Join the Astronomy Club instead.

212
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,560
Why not?

213
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
Promise me you'll come.

214
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,680
Teacher Bambam, have you forgotten?

215
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,160
Five years ago,

216
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,360
ten of our students left
because of the Astronomy Club.

217
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:00,079
That doesn't include the janitor
who went into that room to clean.

218
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
They're all gone.

219
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,040
It's just you left.
You should've learned your lesson.

220
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,760
Your legs barely walk properly now.

221
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,880
What? What's wrong with my legs?

222
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,880
They always walk straight into table legs
and bump into everything.

223
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,319
Our table legs are all damaged.

224
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:18,120
That's not true.

225
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,560
It's just a coincidence.

226
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,520
See? It's what we just talked about.

227
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,319
It's the Astronomy Club curse.

228
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,040
Wait and see. More students will get hurt.

229
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm taking out
personal accident insurance.

230
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm buying it for the students too.

231
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,439
The Astronomy Club used to be here

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,160
but I'm not sure
if it's still the same place now.

233
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,359
I haven't been here in a long time.

234
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,959
ASTRONOMY CLUB

235
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,120
Are you two registering for this club?

236
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,240
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

237
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
Welcome to the Astronomy Club.

238
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,520
But it's a little bit messy.

239
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,560
Come on in.

240
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,599
Wait here.

241
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,599
Right here.

242
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,560
I'll be right back.

243
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,319
Here's your application form.

244
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,719
Luna, it's not just messy.

245
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,719
It looks abandoned.

246
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,200
Fill out the application form first.

247
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,000
Give it to me once you're done.

248
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,639
You can sit or stand anywhere.

249
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,319
Make yourself at home.

250
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,119
Wow.

251
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,480
Three students are taking
an interest in this club.

252
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,440
Don't worry about the curse that
people are talking about.

253
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm buying insurance for everybody.

254
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,760
Thank you, Teacher Bambam.

255
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,639
See?

256
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,560
There's nothing to worry about.

257
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,879
However, this club can't open yet.

258
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,919
The number of members
is still less than four.

259
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,639
We must find one more member
within the next week.

260
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,200
Do you know anyone
who might be interested in joining?

261
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,960
I think I know someone.

262
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,480
That's great.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,639
But…

264
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,639
What?

265
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,000
-Is your friend scared of the curse?
-It's not that.

266
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm just not sure if she wants
to join any human clubs.

267
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,480
Are you Aylin?

268
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,120
I'm Luna.

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm wondering if you want to join
the Astronomy Club.

270
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,720
Interested?

271
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,840
What's wrong with her?

272
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,440
You like aliens, don't you?

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,840
Me too.

274
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,440
Our club offers you lots of playthings.

275
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
We also have a telescope.

276
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,200
We even have an Apollo 11 rocket model.

277
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
Interested?

278
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,280
OUTER SPACE ENCYCLOPEDIA

279
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
-Why did you throw that at me?
-Because you won't talk to me.

280
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
So, I sent you the message.

281
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,159
PLEASE JOIN THE ASTRONOMY CLUB.

282
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,600
What?

283
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,159
Where did she go?

284
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Is she really an alien?

285
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,960
Sun, do you believe in the club's curse?

286
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,360
I live in a Shaman's house with a medium.

287
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,840
What do you think?

288
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,520
Really?

289
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,159
You mean a medium
who's possessed by ghosts?

290
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,440
Boo!

291
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,679
Did you really fall for that?

292
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,919
I'm kidding, Ongsa.

293
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,720
What are you playing at? You scared me.

294
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,840
I don't believe in that nonsense curse.

295
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you believe it's real?

296
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,480
I…

297
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm not sure if I should believe it.

298
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,440
You're not sure if you should believe it.

299
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,040
What kind of answer is that?

300
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,600
Ongsa, you're funny.

301
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm funny?

302
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,399
Just like someone I knew on Instagram.

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,879
He's so funny,

304
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,040
and I really like the pictures he takes.

305
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
Look at this one.

306
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:46,960
Read the caption.

307
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,639
"A cutting-edge man."

308
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,439
And the guy is holding an actual knife.

309
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,480
It's so funny and creative.

310
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,840
Yeah, he's funny.

311
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,760
Yeah. I want to see him so bad.

312
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,159
It's a shame he lives in Phuket.

313
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Shit.

314
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,439
Haplessness kicks in fast.

315
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:19,840
Come on.

316
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,040
Let's get to class.

317
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,840
We were choosing our club today at school.

318
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,439
Do you have that at your school, Earth?

319
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,520
We do.

320
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,200
Which club are you in?

321
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,800
The Stargazing Club.

322
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:04,720
Really?

323
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,399
I'm in the Astronomy Club.

324
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,159
Do you like stargazing, Earth?

325
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,439
Why?

326
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
Is there a reason?

327
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Because stars are the beauty
beyond the Earth at night.

328
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,960
But during the day,
the sun provides us with brightness.

329
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Despite its distance from the Earth,
it can send heat our way.

330
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,439
Are you teasing me?

331
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,919
No, I mean the actual sun.

332
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,639
I don't mean you, Sun.

333
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:49,360
So, what does the sky in Phuket
look like right now?

334
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,159
Is it full of stars?

335
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,879
You can see stars if you live out of town.

336
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,000
What about you?

337
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,520
Do you like stargazing too?

338
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,120
No.

339
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,840
I like the Earth
when it's surrounded by stars.

340
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:20,560
Earth.

341
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,520
Will you come to Bangkok, by any chance?

342
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,840
Yes.

343
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:30,919
Really?

344
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,120
If you come to Bangkok, can we meet up?

345
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:40,840
Holy shit!

346
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,600
Latte.

347
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,040
What should I do?

348
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,280
Crap.

349
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,040
What should I do, Latte?

350
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,600
I shouldn't have lied to Sun.

351
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,639
Just play along.

352
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,200
Deal with the problem later.

353
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,439
Of course.

354
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,679
I'll let you know if I go to Bangkok.

355
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm going to bed now.

356
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
I have to get up early
to make merit with my dad.

357
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,240
Goodnight, Sun.

358
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,960
Gosh.

359
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm sorry, Sun.

360
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
I cannot be your Earth anymore.

361
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,639
This is the only way, Ongsa.

362
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,600
Crap!

363
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,840
Why did I throw away my phone?

364
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,439
Ongsa, what are you doing?

365
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
Ongsa, where are you going?

366
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,760
Where did all the trash go?

367
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Ongsa, what are you doing?

368
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,919
And why are you still in your pajamas?

369
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,960
Alpha, where did all the trash go?

370
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,360
-The garbage collector must have got it.
-Oh no!

371
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,560
No!

372
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:02,560
Aylin!

373
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,560
NO HUMANS ALLOWED
WITHOUT PERMISSION

374
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,439
The iPad I lent you last night,
can I have it back?

375
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Aylin!

376
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,600
-Why is it not working?
-It's broken.

377
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
How did it happen?

378
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm bringing it to a human technician.

379
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,120
Alpha!

380
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,159
Alpha.

381
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,720
Hey, why haven't you showered yet?

382
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,439
Can I borrow your laptop?

383
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,439
You can only type.
You can't access the Internet.

384
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,240
Why not?

385
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,960
The WiFi receiver is broken.
I haven't got it fixed yet.

386
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,199
Maybe

387
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,040
the Astronomy Club curse
has now fallen upon me!

388
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,600
You want to quit the club?

389
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,439
Why?

390
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,439
I've changed my mind.

391
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm thinking of applying to another club.

392
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,639
Ongsa, whatever it is,
you can tell me honestly.

393
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
The curse of this club is real.

394
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,679
The thing Alpha told me this morning?

395
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,120
Is it true, Ongsa?

396
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
I thought Alpha was joking.

397
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,639
It's true.

398
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,919
The curse of this club…

399
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,879
is real.

400
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,360
What kind of curse, Ongsa?

401
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,399
Well…

402
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,639
I…

403
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,199
I faced unfortunate events.

404
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
What about you, Sun?

405
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,399
Did you encounter something bad?

406
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,760
No. Everything is normal for me.

407
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,080
See, Ongsa?

408
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,480
It isn't about the curse.

409
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,040
What happened to you is a coincidence.

410
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,760
How about this?

411
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,480
If you still feel uncomfortable,
I'll take you on a nine-temple trip.

412
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,199
Then we'll find the auspicious time
to get your insurance.

413
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,560
But…

414
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,520
Ongsa.

415
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,919
Ongsa, are you really quitting?

416
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,919
Well…

417
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,439
We joined this club together.

418
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,159
You can't leave me now.

419
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,000
Look at that.

420
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,199
You're so in trouble, Ongsa.

421
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,760
She is so damaging.

422
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,879
Please, Ongsa.

423
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,840
Please stay.

424
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,159
I'm begging you.

425
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,639
This club can't go on without you.

426
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,040
I…

427
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,760
Please, Ongsa.

428
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,639
Please, Ongsa.

429
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,040
Fine.

430
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,320
I'm staying.

431
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,360
Yeah!

432
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,760
Luna, we still need to find
one more member no matter what.

433
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,720
Sure, Teacher. I'm sure I can do it.

434
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,199
Come on, Ongsa.

435
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
The curse isn't real.

436
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,840
You will be lucky tomorrow.

437
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,760
Seriously, I don't think
it's about the curse.

438
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,399
You being hapless now
is just coincidental timing.

439
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,760
It's too much to be a coincidence, Tinh.

440
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,639
I lost my phone.

441
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:50,840
My iPad got broken.

442
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,760
I don't think that's about
the Astronomy Club curse.

443
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,520
You were hapless even before you joined.

444
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,840
I think it's all about you.

445
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,320
Wow, Charoen.

446
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,000
Thanks a lot.

447
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,240
She must be very encouraged now
after hearing that.

448
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,159
That's all right.

449
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,639
It's my pleasure.

450
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,040
I was being sarcastic.

451
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,320
If you're still concerned about that,

452
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,080
I have a solution.

453
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:26,919
This way, please, Luangpu.

454
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,879
Here he comes.

455
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,840
Receive the blessing.

456
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,159
Sukhī dīghāyuko bhava.

457
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,720
Abhivādana-sīlissa niccam vuddhāpacāyino

458
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
cattāro dhammā vaddhanti

459
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,320
āyu vanno sukham balam.

460
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,560
-Sādhu.
-Sādhu.

461
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:56,800
Bless you.

462
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,280
Could you please perform a ceremony
to ward off ill luck for my friend?

463
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,280
She's been so hapless lately.

464
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,639
There's no such thing as a ceremony that
wards off bad luck or haplessness.

465
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,000
Haplessness is what our minds create.

466
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,560
You must think clearly.

467
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:25,639
Everything in this world
happens for a reason.

468
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:29,600
Nothing happens without a cause.

469
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,840
Haplessness is what our minds create.

470
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,040
Hey, Ongsa.

471
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,959
Bird poo.

472
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,959
Don't touch it.

473
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,000
Get a tissue.

474
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,439
-Well, some things are, uh…
-Charoen, give me a tissue.

475
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,040
-Don't touch it.
-They're unexplainable.

476
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,439
I should get going now. Bless you.

477
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,399
-Yes, sir.
-Give me some tissues.

478
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,800
-What do we do?
-Is that enough?

479
00:32:56,879 --> 00:33:00,480
Walk faster or that bird
will poo on your head.

480
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,520
That stupid bird.

481
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,360
It embarrassed me.

482
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,520
I can't do this!

483
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,639
I must resign from the club!

484
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,240
What are you doing?

485
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,480
What are you doing?

486
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,360
Nothing.

487
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,439
I'm just asking.

488
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,719
You can't invade this premise. Get out.

489
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,159
It's not an invasion.

490
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,199
This is school property.

491
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,040
Don't talk about the club.

492
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,040
It's a waste of time.

493
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,240
I didn't come to talk about anything.

494
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,080
I'm just here to get some fresh air.

495
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,480
Why don't you get it somewhere else?

496
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,439
Darn!

497
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,440
Now I understand why
people call you Alien.

498
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,639
You know what?

499
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,799
When Galileo came up with
the round-Earth theory,

500
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,400
people thought he was a freak.

501
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,560
A heathen.

502
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,440
Some even thought he was mad.

503
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,080
Who would've known that
hundreds of years later,

504
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,679
his theory would be proven true?

505
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,199
Aliens. The stories about them.

506
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,480
Though it has yet to be proved

507
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,440
that there are living things like us
beyond the Earth,

508
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,279
I do believe aliens are real.

509
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:50,120
What you believe isn't insane or nonsense.

510
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:54,159
I reopened the Astronomy Club

511
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
because I, too, believe that

512
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,480
we are not the only ones in the universe.

513
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Exploring space on your own can be lonely.

514
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,040
Do you want to explore it with me?

515
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,279
Here. Apply now
and you'll get free insurance.

516
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm going then.

517
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,600
Don't forget to take a look at it.

518
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,560
Free insurance.

519
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,960
Aylin, it might get blown away.

520
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
I'm going now. I'm really going this time.

521
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm really going, Aylin.

522
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Don't forget to have a look.

523
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Bye.

524
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,720
ASTRONOMY CLUB APPLICATION FORM

525
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,600
GOODNIGHT, EARTH.
SAY HI TO ME WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

526
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,000
Girls, let's go. The break is almost over.

527
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,040
Sun, let's go.

528
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,720
Sun.

529
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:28,759
Sun?

530
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,000
Where is your mind at?

531
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,200
What's the problem?

532
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,759
Nothing. No problem.

533
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,960
Tell us what happened.

534
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,680
Well…

535
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,560
I've been talking to someone.

536
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,040
His name is Earth.

537
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,440
Huh? A guy?

538
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,560
Take it easy.

539
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,600
Well,

540
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,319
we are Insta friends.

541
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,359
We've been talking every day.

542
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,799
But he's suddenly disappeared.

543
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,000
He read my messages but he didn't reply.

544
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,359
Why?

545
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,600
Did you have a fight?

546
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,359
No, we didn't.

547
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
He…

548
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,600
He just disappeared

549
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,960
for no reason.

550
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,440
Sun, did you just get dumped?

551
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,359
Maybe

552
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,440
this is the Astronomy Club curse.

553
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,240
So, you two are quitting
because you're scared of the curse?

554
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

555
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,520
Actually, you don't have to quit

556
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:02,120
because if we don't get
one more member today,

557
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,839
the club can't open anyway.

558
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,359
Aylin.

559
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,359
Am I in time for the free insurance?

560
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,000
Yes! We have four members now.

561
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,839
The club can open.

562
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,600
Hold on, Luna.

563
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,759
We…

564
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:31,359
Aylin, there's a curse on this club.

565
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
Aren't you scared?

566
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Superstitions have no effect on aliens.

567
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,480
Okay! I'll get this club open and running.

568
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,200
Teacher Bambam will be so happy

569
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:47,880
when she gets back and learns that
after five years, the club will run again.

570
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,960
Where is Teacher Bambam?

571
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,960
She's in the hospital.

572
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,759
Why?

573
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,160
I heard that she fell down the staircase.

574
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,520
-What?
-What?

575
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:14,839
Can you slow down, Teacher Nida?

576
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,520
My leg hurts.

577
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,240
For God's sake.

578
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:19,799
Give me that.

579
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,839
It's good you only fell a few steps.

580
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,359
Any higher and your leg
would have been broken.

581
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,560
I warned you not to get involved
with the Astronomy Club.

582
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,319
Haven't you heard?

583
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,279
Where there's a will, there's a way.

584
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,359
No matter how many times I'm hospitalized,
I'll do what it takes to reopen the club.

585
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,240
As well as the doctor,
you should go see a monk.

586
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,520
Make merit. It might help.

587
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,040
You don't have to help me.

588
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,240
Do you want to help me again?

589
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,520
Fine then.

590
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,160
You didn't listen to me.

591
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:14,120
Slow down, please.

592
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
We're almost there.

593
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,319
Latte.

594
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,240
Why wasn't I born a dog like you?

595
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,640
That way, I wouldn't have to worry
about anything like this.

596
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:30,080
Ongsa.

597
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,279
Hey. What's wrong?

598
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:33,920
Why that face?

599
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,560
Hmm? What's wrong with her, Latte?

600
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
What's wrong with her?

601
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
I shouldn't have joined
the Astronomy Club.

602
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,080
I've been so damn hapless.

603
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,240
I lost my phone.

604
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,560
My iPad is broken.

605
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,279
Even your laptop can't get Wi-Fi.

606
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,560
A bird pooped on my head.

607
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,839
Nonsense. Here.

608
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,799
Hey!

609
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,240
This is my phone.

610
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,520
Of course it is.

611
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,720
The garbage collector left it with Mom.

612
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:15,799
He found it in the trash can
in front of our house.

613
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,600
Alpha.

614
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,440
Thank you, Alpha.

615
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,799
You're the best. Let me give you a kiss.

616
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,160
Don't.

617
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,720
Save your kisses for Latte.

618
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Alpha.

619
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,400
Latte, I got my phone back.

620
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,160
My sister and cousin are not normal.

621
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,520
But you are the cutest, Latte. Right?

622
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,279
FROM.THE.EARTH:
SUN

623
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,560
Sun.

624
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,640
You've been gone for so long
and now you want to come back?

625
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,640
I'm not gonna talk to you.

626
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:00,759
Sorry I've been gone for days.

627
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,000
I lost my phone.

628
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
I found it just now.

629
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,279
I didn't mean to read
and not reply to you.

630
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,680
I'm sorry.

631
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,720
READ

632
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,920
Be more careful next time

633
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,279
so you don't lose it again.

634
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
Did you really lose it though?

635
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,319
Or did you just want me to miss you?

636
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:57,440
Is it possible that the curse is gone?

637
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,839
But even if there are more curses,
it's still okay.

638
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,640
As long as Sun misses me.

639
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,799
I missed you too.

640
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,359
I'VE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL. I HAD CONGEE
AND CHINESE BREADSTICKS THIS MORNING.

641
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,279
SOUNDS YUMMY.

642
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,080
I HAD DIM SUM. I ATE SO MANY DUMPLINGS.

643
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:32,759
Ongsa.

644
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,480
Ongsa, are you safe?

645
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,440
Are all your body organs still intact?

646
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,400
I'm okay. I'm fine.

647
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,200
Did you hear that Teacher Bambam
fell down the stairs again?

648
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:45,640
What?

649
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,000
That's why we were worried

650
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,200
that the curse would be
more severe on you.

651
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,960
I've got something for you, Ongsa.

652
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,759
This is a Takrut amulet

653
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,839
and this is protection yantra.

654
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,640
Carry them with you so you'll be safe.

655
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,640
It's okay.

656
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,240
I think you should keep them, Charoen.

657
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,160
You can't do that.

658
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,960
Charoen and I both chipped in
to buy these for you.

659
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,160
Ongsa, keep them.

660
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,759
They will protect you.

661
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,600
Thank you so much.

662
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,640
Sādhu.

663
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:41,000
There are no amulets that can
protect you as well as I can.

664
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,560
Ton!

665
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,040
What's up, Ongsa?

666
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Ongsa, since when are you
friends with Ton?

667
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,120
Right. You didn't tell us
you two were close.

668
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,160
-Ton is…
-I'm Ongsa's ex-boyfriend.

669
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:03,080
-What?
-What?

670
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,120
Ongsa is the one who broke up with me.

671
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,319
-What?
-What?

672
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,799
Ton is Ongsa's ex-boyfriend?

673
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,520
Well, it's true but…

674
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,879
You and Ton were dating?

675
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,000
Shit.

676
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,759
The Astronomy Club curse
has struck me yet again.

677
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:46,080
Ongsa, listen to me carefully.

678
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,359
What you did today was so cool.

679
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,759
Ongsa, you didn't come home with Aylin?

680
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,759
Maybe Alien is looking for her friends.

681
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:58,319
If this is the light from a UFO,
it's the only chance to meet my friends.

682
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,520
-Aliens.
-Aliens.

683
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,720
The gates are locked.

684
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:02,799
We have no choice.

685
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:04,040
We must climb over.

686
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,400
Ongsa, you're cute.
