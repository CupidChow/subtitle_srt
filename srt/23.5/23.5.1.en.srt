1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,800
Remember this, Ongsa.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,160
There is only one tip
that will let you get a motorbike taxi.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,760
What tip, Alpha?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,959
Your fingertip.

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:16,880
The usual place?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,880
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,840
Good luck, human.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,400
It's literally your fingertip?

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, it literally is!

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,280
-Sir, where are you going?
-Wait a bit.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,760
-All the bikes are out.
-What?

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,160
What do I do?

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,559
I'm gonna be late.

14
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:57,839
Are you going to S-Tar?

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,599
Hop on.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
You don't want to be late
on your first day.

17
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:06,679
Hop on.

18
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,520
Senior, slow down.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,039
You wanna be late or what?

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,800
I don't, but…

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,880
We've arrived.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,360
You're hugging me so tight.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,199
I'm sorry, senior.

24
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,479
And thank you for the ride, senior.

25
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,520
You don't have to call me "senior."

26
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:02,800
Just call me by my name.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,479
You're in Grade 10?

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,479
I am.

29
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,919
You must be new.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
I'm in Grade 10 too.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,959
My name is Sun. What's yours?

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,079
I… name… my name…

33
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,280
What is it?

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,200
My name is Ongsa.

35
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,160
Nice to meet you, Ongsa.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,560
Has it ever happened to you?

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,160
You recognize someone because
you see them every day on social media.

38
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,519
You see their every move.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,519
You know what goes on in their life.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,679
It's like… you're close.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
She is cute in photos.

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,959
But in person, her cuteness is lethal.

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,679
Ongsa.

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,679
Where have you been?
Why didn't you answer my calls?

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
Ongsa.

46
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,640
What are you looking at?

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,959
Ongsa, are you okay?

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,799
Ongsa. Do you know where
the Grade 10 building is?

49
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,239
Do you know which class you're in?

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
You're absent-minded.

51
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
ONE MONTH EARLIER

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
My name is Ongsa.

53
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,760
I'm an up-country girl
who moved to Bangkok.

54
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Here comes the last box.

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
-Mom and Dad told me…
-Are you sure it's the last?

56
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,400
…that it was just traveling
from one city to another.

57
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,760
-Where's Latte now?
-Where do you want to sleep?

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
But to me, it's more like
traveling to a different universe.

59
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm moving to a universe I don't know.

60
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,120
In this universe,
I must start over from scratch.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,039
Let's lie down.

62
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,919
-New house, new life, and a new school.
-Heavy?

63
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,120
She's Sun.

64
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,359
The Sun of the universe.

65
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,760
Should I follow her?

66
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,800
Hmm, Latte?

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,159
Go downstairs to eat
once you're done talking to the dog.

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,400
Go get Aylin for me.
I don't want to communicate with her.

69
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,640
Did she just say "communicate"?

70
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,640
"Press the button to call."

71
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,960
Gosh!

72
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,560
What is it, human?

73
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,280
Alpha says it's time to eat.

74
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:47,640
Okay, human.

75
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Here comes the hot soup.

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
How are you doing, Ongsa?

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,840
You and Aylin are in Grade 10 this year.

78
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,280
You guys must study really hard.

79
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Especially you, Ongsa.

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,520
If you feel like you're falling behind,
you can ask Alpha for help.

81
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,719
Right.

82
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
Ask me anytime.

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,159
Yes, Alpha.

84
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,159
Eat up.

85
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,239
Alpha, you're my hope.

86
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,960
Yes, Mom.

87
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,359
Ongsa.

88
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,479
Now that you're in Bangkok, try to adjust.

89
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,719
Don't let it be like it was in Phuket.

90
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,680
Try to make lots of new friends.

91
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,359
Can you do that?

92
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,239
I will try, Dad.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Good.

94
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,640
Eat up.

95
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:54,440
Eat some veggies too.

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,760
Mom, look at her.

97
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
Aylin.

98
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,400
Eat some vegetables too.

99
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,520
Your mom told me to make sure of it.

100
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,880
If you don't eat them, I'll tell her.

101
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Tell her, Mom.

102
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,359
Aylin thinks she's an alien.

103
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,520
But aliens don't eat crispy pork.

104
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,400
It's weird here, Latte.

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
You're no better than her.

106
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,079
She's an alien and you talk to dogs.

107
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,360
All I can hope for

108
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:47,439
is that my life in this new universe
runs smoothly.

109
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
But the universe
might have missed my prayer.

110
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,959
It seems like this universe is more
difficult to live in than I thought.

111
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
It's filled with predators.

112
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,400
Come on in. Hey!

113
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,240
-Hey!
-Look. It's like this.

114
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:11,160
One, two, three, four.

115
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,480
One… One, two, three.

116
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's jump as well.

117
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,640
One, two, three, four.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
-Run.
-Yes. From the top.

119
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,000
One, two, three.

120
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,880
Well, let's see.

121
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,560
Two million. Well, I…

122
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Hi…

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,920
Hi, guys. You're back with me,
Tinh, once again.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,199
I got up so early.

125
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,560
It's such a beautiful morning.

126
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,959
What are you all doing?

127
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
-Araham sammā-sambuddho bhagavā…
-Come on. Smile at the camera.

128
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,600
Buddham bhagavantam abhivādemi.

129
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,000
Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo…

130
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,480
-Is this seat taken?
-Dhammam namassāmi.

131
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,120
Supatipanno bhagavato sāvakasańgho,

132
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,959
Sańgham namāmi.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,079
The ecosystem here is cruel.

134
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
It's almost unlivable.

135
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
Just dance.

136
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
Hi, kiddo.

137
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,760
Hey!

138
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,520
This is…

139
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,160
a hi-touch.

140
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,839
Hey!

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,839
Is she dead?

142
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:23,959
I think we might need some help
from Luangpu Sek's holy water.

143
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,079
LUANGPU SEK'S HOLY WATER

144
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,439
She's awake.

145
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,439
Ongsa.

146
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,319
How are you feeling?

147
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,560
Are you okay?

148
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
She's still pretty.

149
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
What?

150
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,199
Pretty, no, I mean… I'm pretty unlucky.

151
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,680
But I heard you say she was pretty.

152
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,920
Well, I guess I'm a little lightheaded
and I said it wrong.

153
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,520
So, why am I here?

154
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,160
You suddenly fainted, so we put you here.

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,439
Slow down, will you?

156
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Take it easy, Ongsa,

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
or you might faint again.

158
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:34,880
My glasses.

159
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,920
Here.

160
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Are you all right?

161
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,520
I'm scared.

162
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,719
What?

163
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,839
Did I scare you?

164
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,360
You're so cute that I…

165
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,079
What?

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,680
You're so cute that I hiccup.

167
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,319
Oh God! What should I do?

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
What did you just do?

169
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,640
This is a new school.
Why is everything still the same?

170
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:47,719
Ongsa! Why are you such a loser?

171
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
Damn it!

172
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
Student.

173
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Girl, are you okay in there?

174
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
Hi, ma'am.

175
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Are you all right? I heard you scream.

176
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,400
Are you sick or something?

177
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm all right.

178
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,680
Please excuse me. I'm going back to class.

179
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,640
Goodbye.

180
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,800
What's your name?

181
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,520
I need your first and last name,

182
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:34,160
date of birth, class, and student ID.

183
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,560
What do you want with those, ma'am?

184
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,599
To tell your fortune.

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,959
Tell me. I'm going to check it for you.

186
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,520
My name is Nunnapat Ampornsopon,

187
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:49,880
I'm in Class 6, Grade 10.
I was born on July 31, 2007.

188
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,760
My student ID is 406235.

189
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,400
You got number 8.

190
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,520
Gosh!

191
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,520
It's truly a misfortune.

192
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,719
Am I going to die?

193
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,400
Possibly.

194
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,240
If you skip class
on your first day like this,

195
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:14,640
there's a very high chance
that you will perish.

196
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,479
It's so good. Unbelievable.

197
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,439
What? I don't even know when it will be.

198
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,640
Hello to you all
on the first day of the new term.

199
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,560
Welcome to the first step
of entering Grade 10.

200
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,439
My name is Nida.

201
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,959
I'm your English teacher.

202
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,439
You all know that already.

203
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,280
But this year, English isn't
the only responsibility of mine.

204
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
That's because I will also be
your homeroom teacher.

205
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,920
I believe you all know each other well

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,520
because you've been classmates
since middle school.

207
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,839
But this term, you have a new friend.

208
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,880
Let's not waste more study time.

209
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,920
New student, please stand
and introduce yourself.

210
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
-You.
-You.

211
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
That's you.

212
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,959
Uh, I…

213
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,560
Sit down, please. It's okay.

214
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,280
Give your new friend a big clap.

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
It's the first day of school.
She must be nervous.

216
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,159
Come to me if you need help, Nunnapat.

217
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,040
Yes, Teacher.

218
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,319
So, what language
are we speaking, exactly?

219
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,760
English is fine.

220
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,440
Be quiet.

221
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,560
You guys.

222
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,919
She's your classmate.

223
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,200
You should take care of her,
not laugh at her.

224
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,560
Honey.

225
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,840
I'm thinking of enrolling Ongsa in math
at the same cram school Alpha attends.

226
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,399
It's an excellent institution.

227
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,639
Even Alpha admires
this tutor's teaching skills.

228
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,320
I don't think her education
is what you should worry about.

229
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:04,760
You should worry about her social skills.

230
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:06,840
Social skills?

231
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,560
Why?

232
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
What's the problem?

233
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,600
If you look closely,

234
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,720
you'll see that Latte is
the only one Ongsa talks to.

235
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,480
Hello, Aylin. Where are you?

236
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,240
I'm on the bench in front of Building 3.

237
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,520
Hello. Can you hear me?

238
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Aylin?

239
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,919
Aylin!

240
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
I don't talk to humankind.

241
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,360
What?

242
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,000
What the heck? Hello?

243
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,399
All right, guys.

244
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
We're going to hit on S-Tar girls today.

245
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,600
Let's see how hot they are.

246
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:57,760
Come on.

247
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,080
What's up, girl?

248
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,440
What are you doing all alone?
Aren't you lonely?

249
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,960
If you're lonely sitting here,
you can sit in my heart instead.

250
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,919
Damn. That was dope.

251
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,919
Of course, man.

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,679
I…

253
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,600
I, ah…

254
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
So? What do you say?

255
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,919
I'd like to go home. Goodbye.

256
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,879
Bye.

257
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Not so fast. Let me take you home.

258
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
That's okay. I'll be going now.

259
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,040
-Come on. Don't go just yet.
-What are you doing?

260
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,280
-Let me take you home.
-What are you doing?

261
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,919
Don't be scared.

262
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,840
We're good people.

263
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,800
We don't want you to get lost…
unless you get lost in my heart.

264
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,919
Ooh! That's a good one.

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,440
Record it.

266
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
Excuse me.

267
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,399
I don't think so. I'll take you home.

268
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,879
Stop! What the heck are you doing?

269
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,280
Let her go.

270
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,879
If you don't stop, I'll tell the teachers.

271
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,480
Did you hear that?

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Look, guys. The student vice president
wants to be a hero.

273
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,679
Come here, hero. You wanna be a hero, huh?

274
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,840
-You wanna be a hero, huh?
-Senior, let him go.

275
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,800
Senior!

276
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,080
-Stay out of it, girl.
-Go!

277
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,480
-Holy shit!
-Whoa!

278
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,800
Nice shot.

279
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,679
Let me see.

280
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,679
Let me see.

281
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,320
Oh, that's cool. Record every bit of it.

282
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm gonna edit it real nice.

283
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,679
-Keep filming.
-Stop it.

284
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,679
That's enough.

285
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Get closer.

286
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,080
Damn.

287
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
-Don't film me. I don't like it.
-Enough already.

288
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,159
Get closer.

289
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,520
Ongsa, hop on.

290
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,480
-Go, girl.
-Ongsa, now. Quick.

291
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,879
-Hop on, Ongsa.
-Go, girl.

292
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
Go, girl.

293
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,919
Keep rolling.

294
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,320
That's enough. Stop recording.

295
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,280
Buzz off!

296
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,560
Teacher Nida will hear about this.

297
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,240
Don't follow me.

298
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:54,800
Follow him. Go.

299
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,919
-I said don't follow me.
-You're dead!

300
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,800
Teacher, huh?

301
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,399
Is this you, Ongsa?

302
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,320
Yes.

303
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,240
Okay.

304
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,120
Let me help.

305
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,399
Thank you.

306
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,080
Hey, Ongsa!

307
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,040
Blood.

308
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,240
Blood?

309
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Don't use your hand. It'll get messy.

310
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay. It's gone.

311
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:51,760
Thank you.

312
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
I'll wash it.

313
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
Tough day today.

314
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,040
What are you talking about?

315
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm talking about school.

316
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,320
I don't want you to feel discouraged.

317
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,320
I get you.

318
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,280
Moving to a new school,

319
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,560
meeting new friends,

320
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,159
and adjusting to a new society

321
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,320
is difficult.

322
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,280
I was like you in middle school.

323
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,879
I felt like school was not for me.

324
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,679
It was like I was in the wrong place.

325
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,800
But I'm telling you, you will get past it.

326
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,200
Even on the toughest day,

327
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,320
something good can happen to you.

328
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,919
It depends on how you look at it.

329
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:11,360
Like the sky today.

330
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,159
Beautiful, isn't it?

331
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,800
I'm gonna go now. See you at school.

332
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,040
Thanks for the ride home.

333
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,639
Get home safe, Sun.

334
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,919
Bye. See you around.

335
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,480
So, how was the first day of school?

336
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,679
Good.

337
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,639
Teacher Nida is
our homeroom teacher this year.

338
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,480
I'm also in the same class as Dear,
Vi, and Kongkwan.

339
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,439
Aha, Vi.

340
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,000
That's all the gang.

341
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
Don't chat too much in class.

342
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,159
Come on, Mom. I pay attention.

343
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,280
Don't worry.

344
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm even more concerned after
hearing you talk like that.

345
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,960
I agree.

346
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,960
Our daughter here is sassy.

347
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Oh please, Mom.

348
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,159
Oh, we have a new friend
joining us this year.

349
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
Is that so? Did you guys talk?

350
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,919
We did more than talk.

351
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,560
I gave that friend a ride home.

352
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,600
That's my girl. I'm so proud.

353
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,520
Like father, like daughter.

354
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,040
Isn't it the trait
that made you fall in love with me?

355
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,639
Right?

356
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,280
Not just me.

357
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,120
Many girls fell for that.

358
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,439
Let's just eat.
This restaurant has great food.

359
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,520
You just changed the subject

360
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,439
Latte.

361
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,320
Hey! Latte!

362
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,159
Latte, look at that!

363
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
The moon is smiling at us.

364
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,159
Something good actually happened.

365
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Pretty, right?

366
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,040
Let's post it.

367
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,919
SHARE A PHOTO OF THE SKY
FROM YOUR PHONE

368
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
FROM THE EARTH ADDED A STORY TO "SHARE
A PHOTO OF THE SKY FROM YOUR PHONE"

369
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,560
Hey! The smiling moon!

370
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,959
I MUST TAKE IT FAST CUZ IT'S SO "EXPRESS."

371
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,280
SHADOW-SORROW

372
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,959
WOW! YOUR HEART GOT ME HOOKED.

373
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
"Your heart got me hooked."

374
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,439
That's creative.

375
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Latte, I don't wanna do homework.

376
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:43,199
@S_SSUNSHINE
HAS STARTED FOLLOWING YOU

377
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:52,760
Gosh!

378
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,720
Latte!

379
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,480
Sun is following me.

380
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,000
Sun followed me. Look.

381
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,720
She's following me.

382
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,159
Latte!

383
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,639
What should I do?

384
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,520
If I send her a greeting message,

385
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,919
that should be okay, right?

386
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,879
Hello…

387
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,080
Is that weird?

388
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,560
What are you doing?

389
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,600
Is that nosy?

390
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,800
Are you doing fine?

391
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,159
She looked fine.

392
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,520
Goodnight.

393
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Shit!

394
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,679
GOODNIGHT

395
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,720
READ

396
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,040
Sun read it.

397
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,439
What should I do?

398
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Latte!

399
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,080
Sun.

400
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:15,080
Please don't think I'm weird.

401
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,760
I'm nobody.

402
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
Someone like Sun won't reply to me.

403
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,639
SUN: GOOD MORNING

404
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,560
Hey. She's famous now.

405
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,919
Ongsa.

406
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,280
Ongsa!

407
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,199
We've been looking for you.

408
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,879
What's going on?

409
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,760
Have you seen the video?

410
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,319
What video?

411
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
Show it to her.

412
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,159
Go.

413
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,600
S-TAR'S GEM

414
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,560
She didn't realize.

415
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:49,080
-It's okay, Ongsa.
-Ongsa, calm down.

416
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,600
-Ongsa, where are you going?
-Ongsa!

417
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,520
Ongsa, calm down.

418
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,839
What should we do?

419
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,080
I don't know.

420
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,160
Once again, I'm a joke in people's eyes.

421
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
It really sucks.

422
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,560
Why am I always cursed like this?

423
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,560
This is not fair at all.

424
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,520
You're invading my territory.

425
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,440
Aylin.

426
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,400
What are you doing?

427
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,279
Searching for aliens.

428
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,799
What?

429
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,920
What are you doing here?

430
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,200
I've got a problem.

431
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Just don't care if human high schoolers
like you or not.

432
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,960
Be yourself.
Don't give a rat's ass about anyone.

433
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,640
What if those friends don't like who I am?

434
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,640
What should I do?

435
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
They're not friends.

436
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,360
Human beings are mean.

437
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,839
Don't be friends with them.

438
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,480
You can be friends with aliens.

439
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,839
Have you seen them, Aylin?

440
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,880
Aliens, I mean.

441
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,799
No. I'm trying to search for them.

442
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,480
Human high schoolers don't get it.

443
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
They call me Alien.

444
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,160
How can you put up with
being viewed as a joke by everyone?

445
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm being myself.

446
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,759
I'm not a joke.

447
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm fine.

448
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,279
I don't care.

449
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,000
You two dared to bully my little sister?!

450
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,680
You had no right to do that!

451
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:22,480
-I…
-Go apologize to her.

452
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,680
I didn't know she was your sister.
I'm sorry.

453
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,160
You have no right to do that to anyone,
regardless of if they're my sister or not!

454
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,799
I get that you two have no brains,

455
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,080
but at least have a conscience.

456
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,240
How could you do that?

457
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,640
You had no right to bully her!

458
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,880
-You bullied your classmate's sister.
-We're sorry.

459
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,640
-We didn't know.
-You didn't know, huh?

460
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,240
Guys, please calm down.

461
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,640
How can I calm down?

462
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,000
We can take this to Teacher Nida.

463
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,799
Didn't you see the video?

464
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,359
He bullied my little sister.

465
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,839
Phone out!

466
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,120
Delete that video
or I'll punch you in the face.

467
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,160
Let me.

468
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,480
Where's the other phone?

469
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,759
-That's all I have.
-Liar!

470
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,240
-We don't have another.
-Give the phone to me.

471
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,880
-Give it up.
-We used only one phone to record.

472
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
-I'm not lying.
-Of course you have it.

473
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,600
Let me see.

474
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,880
She isn't here yet.

475
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,440
Right. What are we gonna do?

476
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,279
Class is about to start.

477
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,120
Hey, will you stop watching that?

478
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,359
So entertaining, huh?

479
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,839
Ongsa, where have you been?

480
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,799
Now.

481
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,640
Are you okay, Ongsa?

482
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,759
Let's just go.

483
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:52,080
Ongsa, are you all right?

484
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,560
Are you sure?

485
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,200
Ongsa, don't pay attention
to those assholes.

486
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:05,200
Right. I asked everyone
to help report that video.

487
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,880
It should be deleted soon.

488
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,839
Ongsa, I will deal with them…

489
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,600
Everybody, take your seat.

490
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,160
I'd like to have a word.

491
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,080
About what happened yesterday,

492
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,480
your seniors would like to say something
to you, Ongsa.

493
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,880
I am sorry.

494
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,839
We truly are sorry.

495
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,920
Sorry I was mean to you.

496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I won't do it again.

497
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,240
I'm really sorry.

498
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,080
I know that shooting photos or videos for
social media content is common these days.

499
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,759
However, you have no right to film those
who refuse to grant consent.

500
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,920
That's a violation of their rights
regardless of gender.

501
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,759
Remember, manners are more important
than content.

502
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,520
Do you understand?

503
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,319
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

504
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,279
I ordered them to have the video deleted.

505
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,279
If there are any more problems,
you can come to me, Ongsa.

506
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,279
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:34,480
Sun was right.

508
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,920
You two, follow me.

509
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,359
Even on the worst day…

510
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:41,920
You okay?

511
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,000
…something good can happen to us.

512
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
I'M ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU, PEACH.

513
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,560
Peach? That's a good one.

514
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,799
SENT YOU A MESSAGE

515
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,080
Goodnight.

516
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,839
That's the only word you know?

517
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,720
Well, then…

518
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,040
sweet dreams.

519
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:21,319
Are you messing with me?

520
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,720
No.

521
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,560
It's late.

522
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,200
I don't want to keep you up.

523
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,600
It's not that late. It's only eight.

524
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,920
My family members go to bed at eight.

525
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,720
Super healthy.

526
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,880
Where are you from?

527
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,640
Phuket.

528
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,720
Hey! I've been to Phuket before.

529
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:57,160
I loved it.

530
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:05,640
We've been talking for so long,

531
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,080
yet I still don't know your name.

532
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,640
I'm Sun.

533
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,600
Just call me Earth.

534
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,160
Your name is Earth?

535
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,480
No.

536
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:37,960
Then…

537
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,279
why do you want me to call you Earth?

538
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,640
Well, the Earth is the Earth.

539
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,839
So?

540
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,560
It revolves around the Sun.

541
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Are you flirting with me?

542
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,080
I'm kidding.

543
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,600
You're a shy guy.

544
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,680
A shy guy?

545
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,279
Guy?

546
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:32,359
Guy!

547
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,359
Me?

548
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:44,200
Nice to know you, Earth.

549
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:51,839
Can the world just explode right now?

550
00:44:06,759 --> 00:44:10,120
I've decided to reopen the Astronomy Club.

551
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Ongsa, do you want to check out
the Astronomy Club?

552
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:14,879
Are you Aylin?

553
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,120
I'm wondering if you want to join
the Astronomy Club.

554
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,560
Ongsa.

555
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,080
We joined this club together.

556
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,480
You can't leave me.

557
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,400
Ongsa, you're funny.

558
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,400
Am I funny?
