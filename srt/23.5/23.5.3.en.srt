1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,359
I've decided to reopen the Astronomy Club.

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:05,960
You want to quit the club?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,400
Ongsa.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,920
We joined this club together.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,959
You can't leave me now.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,799
What's up, Ongsa?

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,279
Ongsa, since when are you
friends with Ton?

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,080
-Ton is…
-I'm Ongsa's ex-boyfriend.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
-What?
-What?

10
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,720
Ton is Ongsa's ex-boyfriend?

11
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,720
Ongsa, so you and Ton used to date?

12
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:34,800
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it dating…

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,280
Dating Ongsa

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,400
was such an incredibly memorable
time for me.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,440
It's a shame we only dated for three days.

16
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,000
Three days!

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
Too short, isn't it?

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,360
-It's too long.
-It's too long.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,279
What?

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,879
Ongsa, ever since we've known Ton,

21
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,160
he's never dated anyone
for more than a day.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Really?

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,679
That means you're a special one
for me, Ongsa.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,720
From the moment I met you,

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,679
I knew right away

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,479
that you, Ongsa, were the one.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
Songkran festival last year,

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,160
Alpha and I planned to play
water-spraying games together.

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
It was the first time I met Ongsa.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
Then, a random group of bad guys turned up

31
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,440
and violently applied powder
to Ongsa's cheeks.

32
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,559
Ongsa was terrified.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,720
Hey, stop!

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,199
That's too much. Enough already.

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,160
Hello, Mr. Handsome. Can you please help?

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
Then my instinct told me…

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,399
Hey!

38
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,720
Hey! Stop it now.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
Help.

40
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,479
-Ouch.
-Who is he?

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
Hey!

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,239
Hey.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,239
Go! Get lost!

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,160
When I saw those innocent eyes of yours,

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,519
-I fell in love with you instantly.
-You should wash your face.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
You've got a powder stain.

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
I wondered…

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,200
-Thanks, Ongsa.
-…if that was the magic moment of love.

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,720
After that, we went out.

50
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,560
We dated for three days
on public holidays.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,239
Ongsa, would you like to be my girlfriend?

52
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,600
Yes, I would. I guess.

53
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:58,640
Really?

54
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,280
Ton, you can let go now.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
I can't.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
Please, let go.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,399
I reluctantly let go of her hands

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,320
so she could go back to Phuket.

59
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,840
It's hard to forget
your first love, isn't it?

60
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,679
Ton.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,079
Ongsa,

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,679
though we broke up,

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,000
this brother of yours
still loves and cares for you.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,200
You're the coolest love I've ever had.

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,359
You know that?

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
Ton!

67
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,920
Wow! That's romantic.

68
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,880
Sun.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,399
Oh, hey! Guys.

70
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,679
Can you please keep this story a secret?

71
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,519
Because I know I'm famous.

72
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,280
The security guard has been seeing
this green light for two days.

73
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,840
When he went up to check what it was,
it was gone.

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,359
What do you think it is?

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,080
I don't know.

76
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,880
It's hard to pinpoint what it is.

77
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,240
It could have been generated by anything.

78
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,120
Maybe it's the reflected light
of an object

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,400
or just

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
an ordinary light bulb.

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,919
I don't think it's from a light bulb.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,680
If so,

83
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,800
it should stay in the same spot
whether it's on or off.

84
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,359
If we want to find out what it is,

85
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,080
we should check it out ourselves tonight.

86
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,240
Are you nuts?

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,039
We just need one of the teachers
to sign a permission slip.

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,479
We're the Student Committee.

89
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,159
It shouldn't be that hard, right?

90
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,840
And what reason would you give?

91
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,479
To figure out the source
of a mysterious light?

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
I doubt you'd be permitted to.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,520
You might even get scolded.

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Mawin is right.

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,280
Don't risk it.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,919
Just forget it.
It doesn't matter what the light is.

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,200
-True.
-Fine.

98
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,840
Alpha.

99
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,880
Aylin, why didn't you knock
before coming in?

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,440
Alien wants to borrow a charger

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,240
for this thing.

102
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
You're borrowing my phone charger?

103
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,080
I don't have it, Aylin.

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Why don't you go borrow Ongsa's?

105
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,159
What. A. Waste.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,719
Hey, Aylin!

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Be careful with those.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,200
You're wrinkling them.

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,159
Maybe this is

110
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,239
a friend.

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,919
Don't mind her.
She's also like this at home.

112
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,400
-It's normal.
-Normal?

113
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,159
Students.

114
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
We're voting for the class president,

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,000
the class vice president,
and the treasurer.

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,039
You should all be fairly well-acquainted
with each other by now.

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,880
Let's start with the class president.

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
Nominating Sun.

119
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,359
Sun.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
Sun, as well.

121
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,640
-Me too.
-Yes.

122
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,599
-Sun.
-Sun.

123
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,799
Let's start voting then.

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,320
Raise your hand if you want Sun
as our class president.

125
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,280
That's unanimous.

126
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,200
Sun, can you be the class president?

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,919
I can.

128
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,000
Can I be the class vice president
so that I can help her?

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,880
Sure. What do you all think?

130
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

131
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
So, we have the treasurer position left.

132
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,760
Any volunteers?

133
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,160
I'd like to volunteer.

134
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
Ongsa. No.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
That's great.

136
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you for your sacrifice.

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,680
Please cooperate with them, everyone.

138
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, Ongsa.

139
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,720
The school needs a 100 baht sports day fee
from each one of you.

140
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,840
Please collect it
and hand it to me tomorrow.

141
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,880
Guys, what should I do?

142
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,959
I still need to collect money from
over half of the students in our class.

143
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
I don't know how to ask them.

144
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,120
I've never demanded money from anyone.

145
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,280
Even when a vendor gives me
the wrong change,

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm not bold enough to complain.

147
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
What should I do?

148
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,199
Who told you to volunteer?

149
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,959
You raised your hand with confidence,
but now you're depressed.

150
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,800
This duty doesn't suit you a bit.

151
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:04,280
If I were you,
I'd ask them civilly and politely.

152
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,800
For example.

153
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,120
Greetings, my friend. Kindly pay up.

154
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,480
If they paid willingly,

155
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,959
I would give them blessings.
I'd wish them wealth.

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,839
Thank you, my friend.
I wish you wealth and prosperity.

157
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,720
Come on! If you do that,
you will never get the money.

158
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
You must play hardball.

159
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,439
Roll up your sleeves.

160
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,839
Stare them down.

161
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
If you don't have cash, pay by scanning.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,439
If you don't have money,
pay in installments.

163
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,240
If you don't pay installments,

164
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,839
you're dead, exploiter!

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
That's it. I guarantee
they will pay quickly.

166
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Are you sure?

167
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Hey!

168
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
The Nestlings admin has an update.

169
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
"Nestlings"?

170
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,800
Ton's fandom name.

171
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,800
What does it say?

172
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
Holy crap!

173
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,480
What's going on?

174
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,040
You should see this.

175
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,560
TON'S 3-DAY EX

176
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,920
-SHE MUST BE SO COCKY
-THAT'S ALPHA'S YOUNGER SISTER

177
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
I wondered if that was
the magic moment of love.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,319
There's a video too.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,880
Hey. Is that her?

180
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,280
-Ongsa. Here's the sports day fee.
-Ongsa. Here's the fee.

181
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,040
SPORTS DAY MONEY

182
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Thank you.

183
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,280
How did you manage to date Ton
for three days?

184
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,480
I've never seen anyone
last longer than a day.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,800
We just met by chance.

186
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,400
Because you're Alpha's
younger sister, right?

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,079
But you and Alpha are so different.

188
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,600
You think so?

189
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,120
I need to collect more money.
I'll talk to you later.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Blossom, will you please pay
the sports day fee?

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,880
If you don't have it today,
you can pay tomorrow.

192
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,959
But it can't be later than tomorrow.

193
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Even if I had it, I wouldn't freaking pay.

194
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,719
You can't do that.
Teacher Nida told us to pay.

195
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
Why are you asking me to pay when
you're the one with the profit?

196
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,120
What profit?

197
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,240
You dated Ton.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Roll up your sleeves. Stare them down.

199
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,280
If you don't have cash, pay by scanning.

200
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,680
If you don't have money,
pay in installments.

201
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,599
If you don't pay installments,
you're dead.

202
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,560
You…

203
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,079
I said I won't pay!

204
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,319
You must! It's unfair to others
if you don't pay.

205
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,199
It was unfair too that you dated Ton.

206
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,160
What does that have to do
with the sports day fee?

207
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,079
Right!

208
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,719
It doesn't have anything to do with that.

209
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Blossom, you should pay.

210
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,280
I wish you…

211
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,079
You want me to pay?

212
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,040
Fine.

213
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,719
How about a one-on-one basketball game?

214
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,040
If you win, I'll pay.

215
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,280
Got the guts?

216
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
How can she win?

217
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
-You're on the school team.
-Exactly.

218
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
That is

219
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,319
wrong, Blossom.

220
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,839
Okay. Fine!

221
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,079
It's not fine!

222
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,120
I will compete with you tomorrow.

223
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:05,959
I guess.

224
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
That's it.

225
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,680
Ongsa.

226
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,400
Hello, everyone.

227
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:34,640
This is Tinh. I'm now a member
of the Student Committee Club.

228
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,479
Today is a good day

229
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,839
to take you on a tour
of our S-Tar Student Committee room.

230
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,640
There's an activity board.

231
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,560
Oh, look! Look at them.

232
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
It's Alpha, our student president.

233
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,240
She looks beautiful
both in photos and in person.

234
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,800
All right.

235
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,319
And this is an activity schedule.

236
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,439
Wow.

237
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,800
It's jam-packed.

238
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
But let's move on
to the next interesting thing.

239
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
This is our trophy shelf.

240
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,400
Look.

241
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
We've received numerous honors
across multiple fields,

242
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
including education,

243
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,079
academics, sports,

244
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,959
and music.

245
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,079
Wow!

246
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
All right then.

247
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,640
Moving on to the next one.

248
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:26,640
This is our school's long table
for meetings.

249
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,880
Whoa. How is it?

250
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,800
Hey.

251
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,400
Will you stop following me?

252
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm not.

253
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,560
The table is dusty so I am cleaning it.

254
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,280
Then, if you're done cleaning,

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,160
please step out of my frame.

256
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,560
Okay.

257
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Thank you.

258
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
All right. Let's carry on
with our tour, guys.

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,800
Look at these trophies.

260
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,760
We're not done yet. Let's keep exploring.

261
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,199
Mawin.

262
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,479
What are you doing?

263
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,479
Why were you being weird with him?

264
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,959
I wanted to get to know Tinh

265
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,680
but I didn't know what to do.

266
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:19,800
Mawin. I know you like him.

267
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,240
Just muster up the courage to talk to him.

268
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,479
Be confident.

269
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,959
Remember. It's best to be yourself.

270
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
Trust me.

271
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,359
When I'm being myself,
you call me a freak.

272
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,479
Who wants to hunt
the filth-eating spirit with me?

273
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,439
-Me.
-I do. I do.

274
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,719
What filth-eating spirit?

275
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,280
Well, that mysterious green light that
was captured by the security guard.

276
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,680
Stop it, Ton.

277
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,160
You're being nonsensical.

278
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,599
And you're persuading them
to be nonsensical too.

279
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,159
Everybody, listen. You are the members
of the Student Committee.

280
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,520
You abide by the rules.

281
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,200
You must be role models
for other students.

282
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,599
Mawin, what's the punishment for those
who sneak into the school at night?

283
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,159
Those who enter school after 6:00 p.m.

284
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
will immediately be placed on probation

285
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,760
and have to complete social work
for the entire semester.

286
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,399
So stop being obsessed
with the green light.

287
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,080
If I find out any of you have broken
the rules, you're doomed.

288
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:40,480
Why do you have to be so fierce, Miss Al?

289
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,040
You are frightening my juniors here.

290
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,280
Stop talking, ass.

291
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
Back to your club. Go.

292
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
Come on, Miss Al.

293
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
Miss Al, please listen to me.

294
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,520
-I'm not listening.
-Look around you.

295
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
-Just leave, Ton.
-Everyone wants to join in.

296
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,600
-Miss Al. Miss Al…
-Go.

297
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,480
Go back to your club.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,560
Ton. Ton!

299
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,080
Hi. What's up, handsome?

300
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,520
Are you still up for
the filth-eating spirit hunt?

301
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,520
How can I not be?

302
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
Otherwise,

303
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,560
my reputation would be ruined as leader
of The Mysterious Stories Club.

304
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,600
Can I please join you then?

305
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm so drawn to the word "light."

306
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,360
I also have a YouTube channel
called TinhTinh.

307
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,000
Ah, a channel called TinhTinh.

308
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Let's do it.

309
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,760
-Your friend Charoen is going too?
-Yeah.

310
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
The more the merrier.

311
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,280
But you cannot let Alpha know
that this was my idea

312
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,520
or I'll get completely chewed out.

313
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:46,480
-Okay?
-Sure.

314
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
Let me see your channel.

315
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,919
Hey, Ton. Ton!

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,639
Can I come as well? Can I join in?

317
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,679
What's going on now?

318
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,240
You were against me going just now.

319
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,919
I know.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,360
And you are terrified of ghosts, Mawin.

321
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,800
Yeah, you're right. But I…

322
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
I want to learn its anatomy.

323
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,679
Anatomy?

324
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,000
Then, meet me here at 7:00 p.m.

325
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,000
If we don't see the light
or the filth-eating spirit,

326
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,120
we don't go home.

327
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,480
Right.

328
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
Filth-eating spirit.

329
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
What do you think this light is,
human teacher?

330
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,720
This is like…

331
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,360
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

332
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,200
It's a UFO light.

333
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,879
I must see with my own eyes.

334
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,879
Please.

335
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,440
DOCUMENT OF AUTHORIZATION
FOR OVERNIGHT STAY AT S-TAR SCHOOL

336
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,280
I can't sign this for you, Aylin.

337
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,840
You are aware that it is against
the school's rules.

338
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,480
If I do, the principal
will certainly fire me.

339
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
You are a mean human teacher.

340
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,760
This is the only way that
Alien will see her friend.

341
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,080
What are you doing?

342
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,280
You like to ask weird questions, human.
You can clearly see what.

343
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,960
Hey. I won't allow you to crash
in the club room.

344
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,879
You must go home.

345
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,040
Alien doesn't care
what a human being orders.

346
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,280
But if the teacher on duty finds you,
you won't be the only one in trouble.

347
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,240
Teacher Bambam and I
will be in trouble too.

348
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,480
Please.

349
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
Don't cause trouble.

350
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,200
You told me what I believe isn't nonsense.

351
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,879
Why are you going back
on your word, human?

352
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,320
Come on. It's different.

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,639
If the teacher on duty catches you,
you'll be on the probation list.

354
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
But this is important.

355
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,159
If this is the light from a UFO,

356
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,720
it's the only chance to meet my friends.

357
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
A person with lots of friends like you
wouldn't get it, human senior.

358
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,679
If you want to tell the teachers,
go ahead.

359
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:02,040
You don't care that you'll be punished?

360
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:03,760
No.

361
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,800
Then I'm coming with you.

362
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:11,960
Why?

363
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,679
I want to see more aliens.

364
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,639
See if they are stubborn
like the one right here.

365
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,399
Did I spook you?

366
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,320
Come here.

367
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,679
How are you doing?

368
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:03,560
Difficult, isn't it?

369
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,960
You don't know how
to play basketball, do you?

370
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,399
It's like I've already lost
even before the game started.

371
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:13,800
I shouldn't have accepted her challenge.

372
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,040
I think I might have to pay for her.

373
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,760
You can't do that.

374
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,320
You will just be spoiling your classmate.

375
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,000
What if Blossom doesn't want
to pay again next time?

376
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,879
What if she comes up with another excuse?

377
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,679
Will you keep paying for her?

378
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,399
No way.

379
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,800
Ongsa,

380
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:38,399
listen to me.

381
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,879
I believe you can do it.

382
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,679
How can I do it?

383
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,480
I don't even know how to shoot this thing.

384
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I'll show you the ropes.

385
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,600
Sun…

386
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,480
Why are you making that face?
You don't trust me?

387
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,120
It's not that. I…

388
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,560
I was a champion in primary school.

389
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
That's awesome, Sun.

390
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Here. Let me teach you.

391
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,840
Hold the ball like this.

392
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,919
Palm open.

393
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:27,280
Fingers apart. Okay.

394
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:30,800
Right. Yes. A bit more.

395
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,280
Then use your left hand
to help hold the ball.

396
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Now, try again.

397
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,280
Open your right hand. Okay.

398
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,080
Like this.

399
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
Hold it up. Arm upright.

400
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:47,520
Right.

401
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,000
Use your left hand to support the ball.

402
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
When you shoot, bend your knees a little.

403
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,960
Down.

404
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,800
Down. And then throw it with force.

405
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,919
That's okay. You almost got it.

406
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,879
Arm upright.

407
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,800
This time throw harder.

408
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
As hard as you can.

409
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:19,960
You can do it.

410
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,840
One, two, three.

411
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,960
I never knew human hearts
could be this fast.

412
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:53,679
Mine is beating so hard
I'm afraid Sun might find out

413
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,679
what I think of her.

414
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Get up slowly, Ongsa.

415
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:07,320
-Are you okay?
-I'm so sorry, Sun I'm so sorry.

416
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,600
Are you hurt, Sun?

417
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,159
Hey, I'm fine.

418
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:13,439
Are you all right, Ongsa?

419
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
I'm okay.

420
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,080
Why is your face red?

421
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,879
Are you sick?

422
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,480
Do you have a fever?

423
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
I…

424
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm hot.

425
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:35,639
I've been practicing
and the sun is burning bright.

426
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm hot.

427
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,399
Ongsa,

428
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,280
you're cute.

429
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:47,280
Where is the ball?

430
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,760
Over there.

431
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,800
You asked for trouble, Ongsa.

432
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,199
Why did you volunteer?

433
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,399
I thought it was one way
to be close to Sun.

434
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,399
If I had known I'd be in this position,

435
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,439
I wouldn't have dared.

436
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,320
Where are you going, Latte?

437
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,199
Earth, is everything all right?

438
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,879
Why do you sound sad on your Stories?
You can talk to me.

439
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:18,960
It's nothing.

440
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
I just feel like
I am not good at anything.

441
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,399
I fail at whatever I do.

442
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,480
I don't know what you just experienced,

443
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:35,600
but I believe that you can do it.

444
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,919
Thank you, Sun.

445
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,879
You don't have to thank me.

446
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,320
I will always send you support.

447
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,720
Ongsa. Aylin didn't come home with you?

448
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,439
No. I came home by myself. Why?

449
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,080
Aylin isn't in her room.

450
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,080
She isn't picking up my calls.

451
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,040
I don't know where she is.

452
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,879
Have you talked to her at all?

453
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
She isn't an irresponsible kid, usually.

454
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,959
Where did she go?

455
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
Is Alien looking for her friend?

456
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,439
Get up. Let's go find Aylin.

457
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,000
Dammit. Latte, do you want to go too?

458
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,080
There are no motorbike taxis at all.

459
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,040
That's okay. I'm going to book a cab.

460
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,000
Sun?

461
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,959
Ongsa, Alpha.

462
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,600
What are you two doing here?

463
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,439
We are going to school.

464
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,560
Right now?

465
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,840
Aylin didn't come home.

466
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,199
So, we think she might be at school.

467
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I think she is hunting down

468
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,439
the green light
captured by the security guard.

469
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,159
She must think it's her alien friend.

470
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,240
Can I give you guys a ride then?

471
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,919
No, that's fine. Alpha is calling a cab.

472
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,679
Thank you, Sun. We do need your help.

473
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,240
Ongsa, you hop on first.
I'll take the back.

474
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,040
Why should I get on first?

475
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,679
If you sit at the back,
you might fall off the bike.

476
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
Come on.

477
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:44,600
Hurry up.

478
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,639
Scoot over a little.
There's not enough room.

479
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,080
Hold on tight.

480
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,919
Let's go.

481
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,600
Let's move. Be careful when you walk.

482
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
Hi, guys.

483
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm still at S-Tar.

484
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,000
My friends and I are hunting down
the filth-eating spirit.

485
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,399
Let's see if it's real.

486
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,919
Let's go.

487
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
Shit! The teacher. Hide.

488
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,120
Almost busted.

489
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,840
If we get busted, we will all be expelled.

490
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,399
Then don't get busted.

491
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:53,719
Walk closer.

492
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,439
You might get lost.

493
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,240
I've attended here since I was a kid.
I can get around with my eyes closed.

494
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,600
You can trip if you close your eyes.

495
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,800
Poor humans.

496
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
What are you doing?

497
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,439
You might get lost. Come on.

498
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,560
I can walk myself.

499
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,320
Don't be stubborn. Come on.

500
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,600
Let's go.

501
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
Gosh. Move already.

502
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,000
This kind of feeling…

503
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,000
What is it?

504
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,040
Thank you, Sun.

505
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,959
The gates are locked.

506
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,439
Alpha, don't you have a spare key?

507
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,959
I am the student president,
not the school owner.

508
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,439
How would I have the key?

509
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,439
We have no choice.

510
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,280
I think

511
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,679
we should climb over.

512
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,360
Sun, are you serious?

513
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:16,760
Damn.

514
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,600
She's so cool.

515
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,679
If you're not gonna move,
then I'll go first.

516
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
Hey.

517
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,040
Ongsa, come on.

518
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,840
Ongsa,

519
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:34,840
if you don't climb over now,
I'll leave you here.

520
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Alpha, wait a second.

521
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,240
-I'm coming.
-Up.

522
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,080
A bit more. You can do it, Ongsa.

523
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,679
Be careful, Ongsa!

524
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:52,959
Ongsa.

525
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,279
Are you hurt?

526
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,480
Ongsa? Are you all right?

527
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,080
You okay?

528
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,319
What are you all doing here?

529
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
Good evening, sir.

530
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,520
Hey, it's you.

531
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,360
-Aren't you the student president?
-I am.

532
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
What are you doing in school
this late at night?

533
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,480
I forgot something in the committee room

534
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,319
and I really need to use it.

535
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,799
Next time, you can just let me know.

536
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,839
Don't climb the school gate like that.
You might get injured if you fall.

537
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,799
Sure. I'll remember that.
Thank you so much.

538
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,120
Thank you.

539
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,040
Let's go. Come on.

540
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,520
Ongsa, move.

541
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
-Alien!
-Alien!

542
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,160
My friend.

543
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,440
Where is it, Ton? The filth-eating spirit.

544
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,640
Not so loud, Tinh. We'll be caught.

545
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:25,839
Hey! It's there.

546
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,839
Hey.

547
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,120
Let's go.

548
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,960
Oh, gosh!

549
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,640
-Ton!
-Luna!

550
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,120
-The filth-eating spirit is gone.
-The alien is gone.

551
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,000
Filth-eating spirit?

552
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,360
Seriously, Ton? How on earth
did you come up with that?

553
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,240
Alien isn't much better.

554
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:48,440
-Filth-eating spirits aren't real.
-You are talking as if aliens are.

555
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,560
They're more likely to be
than filth-eating spirits.

556
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,799
Damn it, you guys.

557
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
Why didn't you listen to me?

558
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,799
I told you to ignore this stupid light.

559
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,279
Especially you guys, Mawin, Ton,

560
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,319
and Luna.

561
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,920
You guys are Student Committee members,
but you are the ones breaking the rules.

562
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,640
You are old enough to know better.

563
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,480
Instead of stopping the young ones,
you are leading them here.

564
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,759
And this stupid light is nonsense.

565
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,080
It's not real.

566
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,480
Hey! That's…

567
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,480
The spirit!

568
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,440
My friend.

569
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,960
-Ton.
-Ton.

570
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:43,200
So, the mysterious light is you guys.

571
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,960
What are you three doing here?

572
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,920
We are here to make light sticks
for Ton's fan club.

573
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:52,480
Tomorrow is Ton's birthday.

574
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,120
We hoped to finish them and surprise him
by the end of the first period.

575
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
Why didn't you guys do it at home?

576
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,520
Why in school in the middle of the night?

577
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,000
People thought the light was an alien
or a fifth-eating spirit.

578
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
Thank you so much

579
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,480
for sacrificing your precious time for me.

580
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,560
Though I didn't find
a filth-eating spirit,

581
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,480
I found your love.

582
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,799
That's enough to make me feel whole.

583
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,680
Students, what are you all doing in here?

584
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,720
TON'S FC

585
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,600
Guys, run!

586
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,560
Hurry!

587
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
Go on. Run. Keep running.

588
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,200
Students, stop it.

589
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,359
Students!

590
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,319
Guys, move, move! The teacher is coming.

591
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,000
-Move it!
-Students!

592
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,040
-Go! Run!
-Move!

593
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,960
-Quickly! Run!
-Get up.

594
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,000
Hurry up!

595
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,080
Students.

596
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,279
Students.

597
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,279
-Ouch!
-Hey, Ongsa.

598
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,799
Let's hide in there. Get up slowly.

599
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,480
Students.

600
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,000
Show yourselves.

601
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,920
Students.

602
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think he's gone.

603
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,200
I thought we would get caught.

604
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:02,160
We should go.

605
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,480
Can you walk, Ongsa?

606
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:14,279
Get up slowly.

607
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,000
Aylin, let's go.

608
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
I will take you home.

609
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,920
Hey, why are you crying?

610
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,960
Everything's gone wrong.

611
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,839
I thought I would get to see my friend.

612
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,400
Turn this way look at me. Aylin…

613
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Aylin.

614
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Why are you poking me?

615
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,080
Poke out your finger.

616
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,680
Let's be friends.

617
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,080
I don't wanna be your friend,
human senior.

618
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
Who said I was human?

619
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,400
I am a moon.

620
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,359
Can an alien be friends with a moon?

621
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,880
Well?

622
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,000
So, we're friends from now on, Aylin.

623
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:37,640
Come on.

624
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,400
Let's go home. I'll take you home.

625
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,400
Give me your hand.

626
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,839
Hey.

627
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,600
Come on, let's go.
Quickly, or the teacher will catch us.

628
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
Put on your school bag.

629
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,600
Come here. You!

630
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,560
You!

631
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,560
And you!

632
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:11,960
You're on the Student Committee, but you
are the ones who breached the rules.

633
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,040
What are the rules for
if you don't keep them?

634
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,880
You're lucky no one caught you

635
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:21,720
or all of us would be screwed.

636
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,080
But Miss Al,

637
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,799
we didn't get caught, did we?

638
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,279
Stop back talking!

639
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,200
Even though you didn't get caught,
I, as the student president,

640
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,400
will punish you guys myself.

641
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,279
Every one of you

642
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,120
must clean the Student Committee room
for the whole semester.

643
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,480
Don't let me see PM 2.5 dust in here.

644
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,000
-But…
-No buts.

645
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,480
Unless you want toilet-cleaning duty too.

646
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,600
Do you want that?

647
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,080
Hello. Good morning, seniors…

648
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:14,040
I guess you guys are busy.

649
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,279
I'll leave you to it then. Goodbye.

650
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:17,440
You too, Tinh.

651
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,240
Come here.

652
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,279
Hey, Alpha. Don't punish him.

653
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,920
We seniors should take responsibility.

654
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,000
Fine.

655
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,920
There will be no punishment for you
because you're younger.

656
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,200
Really?

657
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:40,400
But

658
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,120
you must be Mawin's assistant
for the whole semester.

659
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,560
Though I got through last night
without punishment,

660
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,600
there's still a big deal
waiting for me today.

661
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:11,200
I almost forgot that I have
a basketball game with Blossom.

662
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,000
How's your foot?

663
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,960
Does it feel any better?

664
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,000
It's been better.

665
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Ongsa.

666
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:41,240
Are you really competing with Blossom?

667
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,279
I must collect all the fees.

668
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,680
How about I try to talk to her?

669
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,040
It's okay.

670
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,400
I'll handle it.

671
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,359
But your foot hurts.

672
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,000
You can't play.

673
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:06,720
Why am I always the one
who gets help from Sun?

674
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,160
Thank you, Sun,

675
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,920
but this time,

676
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,600
I want to try it myself without any help.

677
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,480
Then do your best.

678
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,600
I'll be cheering for you.

679
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,680
I hope Sun develops
a more positive opinion of you, Ongsa.

680
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,680
Ongsa, do your best.

681
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,560
Fight hard, girl. Don't back down.

682
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,040
-Ongsa!
-Go Ongsa!

683
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:53,200
-Go Ongsa!
-You can do it!

684
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:56,160
-Ongsa!
-Ongsa, keep fighting.

685
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,319
Ongsa, hang in there.

686
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,680
-Ongsa, go!
-Go, girl!

687
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,520
-Ongsa, go!
-Ongsa, keep going.

688
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,080
Ongsa, keep fighting.
I'm giving you blessings.

689
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,720
-Ouch!
-Ongsa, go, go.

690
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,920
One point for Blue.

691
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,839
Go, Blossom!

692
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,640
Blossom, you did great.

693
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
It's okay, Ongsa. Try again.

694
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:21,240
You can do it. Start over.

695
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,480
Go, Ongsa.

696
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,600
-Ongsa, keep fighting.
-Go Ongsa.

697
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,759
Keep fighting, Ongsa.

698
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:29,960
Keep fighting.

699
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,560
Hey!

700
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,560
-How is she this good?
-Two points for Blue.

701
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,720
Ongsa, are you hurt?

702
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,839
Ongsa, keep going. You can do it.

703
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,560
Ongsa, fight her.

704
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,000
-Ongsa, keep fighting.
-Ongsa!

705
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,279
You can do it.

706
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,480
Ongsa, keep fighting.

707
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:08,080
-Keep trying, Ongsa. You can do it.
-You can win, Ongsa.

708
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,920
Hey!

709
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,400
-Hey!
-Blossom, are you okay?

710
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,319
Ongsa, the ball.

711
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,120
-Get the ball.
-The ball!

712
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,520
Ongsa, hurry up. Shoot.

713
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,600
-Ongsa, you can do it.
-You can do it!

714
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,319
-Give her blessings!
-Go Ongsa!

715
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,359
-Ongsa, go for it.
-You can do it.

716
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,759
Fight!

717
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,160
-Keep fighting.
-Don't back down, Ongsa!

718
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,200
Keep going, Ongsa.

719
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Game over.

720
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,000
Blue wins 8-0.

721
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,400
In the end,

722
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,799
you're still a loser as always, Ongsa.

723
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,279
Here. The fee.

724
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,400
But I lost.

725
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,279
How could an amateur
beat a member of the school team?

726
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:19,120
Your leg is also injured.

727
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,680
I was impressed you could steal
the ball from me at all.

728
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,279
For such a timid person,

729
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,080
you're one hell of a fighter.

730
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,080
Here.

731
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:29,879
Thank you.

732
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,200
At least you did it, Ongsa.

733
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,080
You collected all the money.

734
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Can you hear me?

735
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:02,839
I guess you can.

736
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,400
I'm done with the basketball game.

737
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,759
I'm waiting for you
in front of Building 3 as always.

738
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,440
Do you hear me?

739
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,920
You do.

740
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,319
See you.

741
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,680
Ongsa.

742
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:35,399
See? I told you you could do it.

743
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,160
But I lost.

744
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,799
I could only collect all the money
because Blossom was nice to me.

745
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,240
But it's because you didn't give up.

746
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,640
What you did today was so cool.

747
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,759
Cool?

748
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,080
Did she just say I was cool?

749
00:50:57,879 --> 00:50:59,399
Why are you making that face?

750
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,960
Don't you believe me?

751
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,799
No one has ever said I was cool before.

752
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,000
Really?

753
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,000
Then listen to me carefully.

754
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,879
What you did today was so damn cool.

755
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,720
So cool

756
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,759
that if you were a guy,

757
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,080
you'd attract all the girls in our school.

758
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,319
Right. I forgot.

759
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,600
You're not a guy, Ongsa.

760
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,879
You're exaggerating.

761
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,200
It's true. I'm not exaggerating.

762
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,799
Ongsa, you're the coolest.

763
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,279
I'm heading home now.

764
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,399
See you tomorrow.

765
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,160
Get home safe.

766
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,879
Are you all right, human?

767
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:32,480
It's nothing.

768
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Is it about Sun?

769
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,480
Hey!

770
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,879
How did you know that?

771
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,960
I took a wild guess.

772
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,879
Aylin.

773
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,560
Please don't tell anyone about this.

774
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,720
-About human Ongsa liking human Sun?
-Hey!

775
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:58,799
What? Ongsa, you like Sun?

776
00:52:58,879 --> 00:52:59,960
Hey!

777
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,000
The Astronomy Club will be holding
astrological fortune readings.

778
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,399
You two must be the fortunetellers
on Club Fair Day.

779
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,120
Aylin and I?

780
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,480
For our Astronomy Club, keep fighting.

781
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,359
Borrowing power from the stars
to foretell someone's fortune

782
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,560
requires you to sell the power
of your own soul.

783
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,040
Ongsa, do you want my help with Sun?

784
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,240
Would you like your fortune told?

785
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,480
-I was born on a Friday.
-Ongsa was born on a Tuesday.

786
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,520
That's why I felt like
we hit it off especially well.

787
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,000
Our fortunes are compatible.

788
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:53,600
Let's say I like someone.

789
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,000
How likely is it that the person
will reciprocate my feelings?

790
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:00,120
Very likely.

791
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,200
That person must like you very much.
