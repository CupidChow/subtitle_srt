1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,720
I'm sorry for
not understanding you at all.

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:11,000
Please allow me back into your orbit.

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,160
If I get the scholarship,
I'll have to live there for a year.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,279
How will we be?

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Sun, listen to me.

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,040
No matter how far apart we are,

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,120
our relationship will stay tight.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,080
It will remain the same.

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
Even if you relocate to outer space,

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,480
I will find a way to contact you.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,360
I'll do it no matter how hard it is.

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,759
I promise.

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,440
This version of you is so cool.

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,920
Don't make me shy.

15
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,360
Thank you, Ongsa.

16
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,079
I went home to look for the book I
borrowed from you, but I couldn't find it.

17
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
I knew it.

18
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,880
I'll buy you a new one.

19
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
Buy one for me too. I don't have it yet.

20
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,440
Wow, these two.

21
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
Luna.

22
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Goodness. Love has transformed you
into a different person.

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
What can I do? I'm madly in love.

24
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,040
I guess everyone is the same.

25
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,959
Not true.

26
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
Aylin is still herself.

27
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:39,920
It's only you who's being clingy.

28
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,679
I despise you so much right now.

29
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,959
Listen to yourself.

30
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,959
Now you know how we feel having to watch
you act pretentious every damn day.

31
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
We despise you too.

32
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,079
Well said, Mawin.

33
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,679
Charoen, I hope you don't despise me too.
Right, sweetie?

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't feel that way about you.

35
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,200
Aw.

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,679
You're the best girl.

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,119
But I don't love you either.

38
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,920
I can't believe you've met
someone like her.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,839
Yeah.

40
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,959
-You've got yourself a challenge, dude.
-Right.

41
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,039
Good job, Charoen.

42
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,599
Ton, you should go back to
belonging to everyone.

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,159
Don't just belong to her.

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,280
-She likes you better that way.
-Exactly.

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,400
By the way,

46
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,560
what exactly is going on
between you and Tinh?

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,159
That's right. Spill the tea.

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,479
Well…

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,440
Well…

50
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Guys, look at that.

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,000
Whoa.

52
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
Look at them walking hand in hand.

53
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,120
What's up with you two?
Are you back together?

54
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,800
You didn't tell us anything, Ongsa.

55
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,919
We are back together.

56
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,159
You're so cool, Ongsa.

57
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,280
You finally made up with her,
human cousin.

58
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,760
Which is what you should've done
in the first place,

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,320
instead of those unhinged things you did.

60
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,200
Come on. I didn't know what to do.

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,320
I've never fought with
a girlfriend before.

62
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,840
You're such a fool, Ongsa.

63
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,159
No more teasing, please.

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,919
But you're the cutest fool ever.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
-Oh, please.
-And the Earth tilts again.

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
All right.

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,200
So, what's exactly going on
between you and Tinh?

68
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,479
Well?

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,719
Right.

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,840
Well…

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,560
We're okay.

72
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,359
Does "okay" mean you're dating?

73
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,280
Mawin told me he wanted to focus on
his college applications first.

74
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,719
We can sort out the rest later.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
Right.

76
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:01,479
The important task for us seniors
is to study hard for college.

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,640
From now on, there may be less time
for us to hang out together.

78
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,080
We need to study.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,159
Right. We will have less time together.

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,280
You study at my house anyway.
Doesn't sound that much less.

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Gosh. You're not like this with friends.

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
Stop it.

83
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,400
Let's go eat.

84
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm so done with you guys.

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,200
What? You're taking the test
for the scholarship to study in the US?

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,039
To study in the US?

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,080
But I'm not sure if I'll pass the test.

88
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
But I'm sure you can do it.

89
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,120
You're smart. You'll get it for sure.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,440
Exactly. You will pass.

91
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,960
I'll ask Luangpu
to give you his blessings.

92
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,320
So we won't get to see you for a year.

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,919
We'll miss you very much.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,120
That's right. I'm sad.

95
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,560
Hey!

96
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,719
Should we make a video capturing memories
from Class 6 for Sun?

97
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,719
Let's do it.

98
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,680
You can watch it when you miss us.

99
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,280
That's a great idea.

100
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,080
Charoen and I will film every moment
of Sun from now on.

101
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,520
Every moment?

102
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,719
Every moment.
Especially the romantic moments.

103
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
You down?

104
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,280
Aren't you gonna eat?

105
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,239
One bite. So you'll have the energy
to do your homework.

106
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,560
-Take a bite.
-It's good.

107
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
Lesson 20.

108
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:01,840
ASTRONOMY CLUB

109
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,799
If Sun gets the scholarship
to study abroad,

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
our Astronomy Club
will have fewer members.

111
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,760
Will our club be terminated, Teacher Nida?

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,320
Sun will be an exchange student,

113
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,159
not transferring to a different school.

114
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,400
She is still an S-Tar student.

115
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
Her name will remain under
the Astronomy Club.

116
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
That's a relief.

117
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,719
What are you guys doing?

118
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:32,280
We are filming stock footage.

119
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,600
Foot… what?

120
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,400
Footage. They are filming a video.

121
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,959
They want to capture good memories
among their classmates for Sun.

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,079
That's right.

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,240
We are filming the daily life
of Sun and friends.

124
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,480
What are you doing?

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
Alien wants to be in the video.

126
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,839
Do you like to be filmed, Aylin?

127
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
No.

128
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:24,360
I'm not in the same class as you.

129
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,480
You only see me at this club.

130
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,600
Being in the video will remind you
of this alien.

131
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,920
Aylin, you're not an alien.

132
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,439
You are a friend to everyone.

133
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
Come on.

134
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,360
We're blessed.

135
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
One, two, three.

136
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,160
What pose am I supposed to do?

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,839
This, ma'am.

138
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,079
-Like this?
-A heart at your cheek.

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,360
Doesn't it look like I've got the mumps?

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,600
It's like you have a chubby cheek.
It's cute.

141
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Thank you so much, guys.

142
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,959
I will never forget this moment.

143
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,079
You won't forget. It's just one year.

144
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,160
Charoen, you're blocking me.

145
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,240
-I'm sorry, ma'am. Tinh is blocking me.
-Move.

146
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
Ready?

147
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
One, two, three. Say cheese!

148
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,800
I'll have to study hard from now on.

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,199
But you always study hard.

150
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,920
Then I must study even harder.

151
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,439
It'd be nice to get
some moral support from you, Ongsa.

152
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,600
You are smart.

153
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
You can do it, Sun.

154
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,520
I don't think that was quite enough.

155
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,199
Ongsa, Sun, hello.

156
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,959
Can I get some more support?

157
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,600
Something small but impactful.

158
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,560
I didn't mean this.

159
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,360
What? What do you want me to do then?

160
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I want to eat something you cook.

161
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,040
You want me to cook for you?

162
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,520
That's right.

163
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,640
Can you do that?

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,680
But I don't know how to cook.

165
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,079
That's exactly why I want it.

166
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,000
Please. It can be anything.

167
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,640
It can be whatever you like. I'll eat it.

168
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,959
-Shit.
-Shit.

169
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,959
-What a fucked-up moment.
-What a fucked-up moment.

170
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,719
-I don't think she can handle it.
-True.

171
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,680
How is it, Dad?

172
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,560
Is it that bad?

173
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,079
It's not bad, dear.

174
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,599
You just can't cook at all.

175
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,240
Dad.

176
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,000
She can't be that bad.

177
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,319
I once asked her to boil eggs.

178
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,079
Uncooked eggs are common.

179
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,479
Everyone makes that mistake.

180
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,599
But Ongsa exploded them.

181
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,360
If boiling doesn't do it,
why don't we try frying?

182
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,520
Frying, steaming, poaching,
we've tried everything.

183
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:35,240
But nothing was edible.

184
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,120
Even Latte wouldn't eat my food.

185
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,560
Let's not lose hope.

186
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,640
Why don't we start with something easy?

187
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,959
Isn't boiling eggs easy enough already?

188
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,000
We can start with something basic.

189
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,839
Which is?

190
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,719
Using a rice cooker.

191
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:07,199
How, Alpha?

192
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,560
Easy-peasy. There's only one tip.

193
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,680
One tip again?

194
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,520
Aylin, do you want to try?

195
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,680
Let me.

196
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,719
-Are you sure, Mom?
-Yes.

197
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,319
Come on.

198
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,240
-Aylin.
-Come and taste it.

199
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:34,719
Aylin, Alpha, try it.

200
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,760
No!

201
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,439
Charoen.

202
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,199
-Charoen?
-Yes?

203
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,719
Where's Tinh?

204
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,280
In the bathroom taking a dump.

205
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,400
You wanna check in on him?

206
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,760
What did you make for me, Ongsa?

207
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,359
Um, it's…

208
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,040
rice.

209
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,199
Fried rice?

210
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,560
Why don't you open it?

211
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Huh?

212
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,359
Why is it only plain rice?

213
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,599
I know. I get it, Ongsa.

214
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,640
What is it, Ton?

215
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,959
The main meal
might be stuck under the lid.

216
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
There's no main dish.

217
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,160
There's only rice.
That's the only thing she could make.

218
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,319
I'm happy with just this.

219
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,000
Really?

220
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,920
Yes. You put effort into making it for me.

221
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
I brought some seasoning powder.

222
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,480
Come on, girl.
Why don't you give her fish sauce too?

223
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,359
I do have fish sauce.

224
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,159
Ongsa. Charoen was being sarcastic.

225
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,680
Don't you want to add anything?

226
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,480
Nope.

227
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,800
Your plain rice is good enough.

228
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:39,760
Human senior.

229
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
Don't you ever give me plain rice alone.
I want crispy pork too.

230
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,760
No. I'll make you
Stir-fried Morning Glory.

231
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:50,520
Let me handle my own food choices then.

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
What? You should learn from Sun.

233
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:57,040
She eats anything her girlfriend cooks.

234
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,879
What are you looking at, Ms. Ongsa?

235
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,639
How could you see I was staring at you?

236
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,639
I thought you were focusing on your study.

237
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,399
I don't need to see it

238
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,679
because I know that the Earth
revolves around the Sun.

239
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,720
What do you mean?

240
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,399
Are you taking the Earth for granted?

241
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,600
No, I'm not.

242
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm just saying
we are meant to be together.

243
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,240
Your sweet words
can change the color of the Earth.

244
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
Change the Earth to what color?

245
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Light red.

246
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,879
I'm shy.

247
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
-No more homework.
-What?

248
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
Sun.

249
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,200
You can continue studying.
I won't bother you again.

250
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,200
No. I want to see the Earth
changing its color.

251
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:39,639
And now it's changing from
light red to vivid red.

252
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,320
Really? Let me see.

253
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,399
You still look normal.

254
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,080
What if…

255
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:53,919
I do this?

256
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,800
Will you still say I'm normal?

257
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,399
That was just one kiss.

258
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,120
The Sun wants more.

259
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,360
How much more?

260
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,320
How about this?

261
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,080
How will we be…

262
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,760
if we stay apart for a year?

263
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,320
No matter how many light-years
we are apart,

264
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:46,600
we will be fine.

265
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,280
In the end, our orbits
will bring us to meet again

266
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:57,200
because the Earth
is meant to be with the Sun.

267
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,080
Like you just said.

268
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,120
Right. It's just one year.

269
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,159
Yes. It's just one year.

270
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,760
Will you miss me, Sun?

271
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
Exactly. Should I miss you?

272
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:20,800
You're not gonna miss me?

273
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,720
You're not gonna miss me?

274
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:35,600
Let me think about it.

275
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,800
Say you will miss me.

276
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,000
Say it.

277
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,760
Say it.

278
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:46,000
-Say it.
-Ongsa, don't.

279
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,760
-Don't tickle me.
-Are you going to miss me?

280
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,320
Are you going to miss me?

281
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,399
DAYS LATER

282
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Aylin, Alpha, I am off to school.

283
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,600
Oh, Sun.

284
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,399
Ongsa.

285
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,320
Are you here to pick me up?

286
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,760
Or has something happened?

287
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:13,200
Well, I…

288
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,720
I…

289
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,320
I got the exchange student scholarship.

290
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm going to be a student in the US.

291
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,159
I did it. Are you happy?

292
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,080
Yes, I am.

293
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,960
-You did it, Sun.
-Yes.

294
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,320
Will you miss me, Ongsa?

295
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:38,520
I sure will.

296
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,439
I am so thrilled.

297
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,200
Should I start packing now?

298
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,560
How many clothes
should I bring for a whole year's stay?

299
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,200
Should I do some more shopping?

300
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,679
Gosh, I'm so excited.

301
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
Don't knock on it.
This is your fault. It's all gone.

302
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,720
-What are we gonna do?
-I'll return the book later.

303
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,120
-I left it at home.
-Yes, return it. I need it for my study.

304
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,240
Hey, Tinh, Charoen.

305
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,919
What's the matter, guys?

306
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Damn it. We just had a fucked-up moment.

307
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:36,320
This is ominous.

308
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,919
Ominous?

309
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,000
What is?

310
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
Are you guys okay?

311
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,679
Everything is ruined.

312
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,159
And it's all ruined because of that
Luangpu Sek holy water of hers.

313
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,159
What does Luangpu Sek's holy water
have to do with this?

314
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,720
And what is ruined?

315
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,159
The hard disk containing Sun's footage.

316
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,639
Charoen dropped it in holy water
and it no longer works.

317
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,919
We lost the video we were making for Sun.

318
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,240
Did she just spill the water on it?

319
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
No.

320
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,399
She literally dropped it
in this holy water basin.

321
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,840
Holy shit!

322
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,480
But why did you bring
this holy water basin to school?

323
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,800
I just wanted to bring good luck
to Sun, Ongsa, Aylin,

324
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:35,399
Luna, Alpha, Mawin, Ton,
Teacher Nida, Teacher Bambam,

325
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,840
and all my friends from Class 6
who want it.

326
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,600
Wow. Charoen, you have
such a generous mind.

327
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,280
I was so right to choose you.

328
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,120
I have a good eye for that.

329
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,439
Stop it, you.

330
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,199
Would you like me to try
restoring its memory?

331
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,320
Right. Mawin might be able to help.

332
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,560
Ouch.

333
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,840
Are you sure you only dropped it
in the holy water basin?

334
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,240
How long was it in there for?

335
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,520
A day.

336
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:14,520
A day?

337
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,520
I just found out today
when I brought this basin to school.

338
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,639
It was bathing in the holy water.
It must be so sacred now.

339
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,399
I think you're right.

340
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,480
Do you think you can fix it?

341
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,399
I don't.

342
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,159
Help them, please.

343
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,840
-We're so careless.
-Sorry, Sun.

344
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,639
-We really are sorry. We didn't mean to.
-We should've taken better care of it.

345
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,760
-Get up.
-Hey, don't. Get up.

346
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Don't do this.

347
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:49,879
Don't do it.

348
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,280
-It's enough. Stop apologizing.
-We're sorry.

349
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,280
No. Don't do this.

350
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,439
Don't clasp your hands like that.
It's too much.

351
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,800
Tinh, Charoen,
you don't have to make me a video.

352
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,240
We do. You'll be away for a year.

353
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,320
We don't want you to forget about us.

354
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,879
I'll never forget about you guys.

355
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,919
Never.

356
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,720
That's right.
Sun isn't the type to forget.

357
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,399
We're sorry anyway.

358
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,720
The final exams are approaching
in a few weeks.

359
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,000
We won't have time to make
another video for you.

360
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,120
I'm so sorry.

361
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
Well, we can make another video,

362
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,720
but in order to get a good edit,
we need time.

363
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,439
We're just sad that all the good moments
we captured are gone.

364
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,919
Everything was in there.

365
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:48,600
Tinh, Charoen, listen to me.

366
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:55,320
I keep all the good moments
of us friends in here

367
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,040
and in here.

368
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,639
We don't need video clips,

369
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,280
music videos,

370
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,080
good films, or nice photos

371
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,560
because I keep our love and friendship

372
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:15,720
in my heart and my memories always.

373
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,840
When I feel discouraged or lonely,
I'll just think about them.

374
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:25,000
I'll think of our good moments,

375
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,800
happiness, and laughter.

376
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
Guys, we only turn 16 once.

377
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,959
So, what are we gonna do next?

378
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,199
Study for our exams.

379
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:49,120
Exactly. We're taking our exams
in a few weeks.

380
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,320
We have a lot more to do.

381
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,040
That's true.

382
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm so afraid I'll fail.

383
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
That's more of a reason you should study.

384
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,399
We should all go.

385
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,000
-Shall we?
-We shall.

386
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,199
-Come on. I'll help you guys study.
-Go.

387
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,399
Yay!

388
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
We're taking English first, right?

389
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
Charoen, are you not going to…?

390
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,919
Not sure.

391
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,439
I must have slept in the wrong position
last night.

392
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
I told you not to study in bed.

393
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm already behind schedule.

394
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,040
Gosh. This is frustrating.

395
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,399
What are you doing?

396
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,480
Massaging you.

397
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,480
Aw. How lovely you are.

398
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:57,080
Right here. I feel tense here.

399
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,360
You're a good masseuse.

400
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,959
From now on,
when you're too tired to study,

401
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,600
I'll read it out loud for you.

402
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,159
And human, if you use headphones,
you'll memorize things better.

403
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:26,120
Thank you.

404
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,760
You're the best.

405
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,280
I've got something to show you.

406
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:41,959
How do I look?

407
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:44,720
We have the exact same alien cap.

408
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,159
Cute?

409
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
It's cute

410
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,360
in an alien-like way.

411
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,720
But I'll be a university student
next year.

412
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:10,959
Are you going to be all right?

413
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,040
I am.

414
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,360
I have friends now.

415
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,720
You don't have to worry, human senior.

416
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:23,520
Then we won't get to meet
as much as before.

417
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,240
But I promise you will always see me.

418
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,280
Are you about to say the moon joke?

419
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,600
I know it.

420
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,120
Can you promise me though?

421
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,679
Promise you what?

422
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,480
Promise…

423
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,879
to be the Aylin
who is happy around her friends.

424
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,199
The Aylin who values friendship.

425
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,600
The Aylin who isn't lonely anymore.

426
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,439
And…

427
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,240
to be my lovely Aylin like this forever.

428
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,320
I promise.

429
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:32,199
And I promise to love you forever.

430
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,199
Your thumb too.

431
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,840
Alien, are you blushing?

432
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,600
This alien is blushing too.

433
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,399
LAST DAY OF FINAL EXAMS

434
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,280
The exams are finally over.

435
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,760
We must celebrate.

436
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,639
-Should we hit that buffet hot pot place?
-We should.

437
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:13,159
-Let's go.
-Can we do a buffet BBQ instead?

438
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,199
I want crispy bacon.

439
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,800
-Sure. Let's go.
-Well, well, well.

440
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,719
What are you guys arranging, juniors?

441
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,120
Aren't you gonna invite this hot,
handsome, and charismatic man

442
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:27,040
to go with you?

443
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,600
We should all go. Think of it
as a farewell party for you seniors.

444
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,840
Charoen, I bet you will miss…

445
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,240
Just focus on studying for college, Ton.

446
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,800
How did you do on the exam, Tinh?

447
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,840
Pretty good, I think,

448
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,159
thanks to you tutoring me.

449
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,439
My grades this semester
will shoot right up.

450
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,120
How did you guys do, Ongsa, Sun?

451
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,679
It was fine.

452
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,560
Don't worry about them. The one you
should be worried about is right here.

453
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,879
Me?

454
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:02,199
I bet my ass he just got it over with.

455
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,000
But you usually give support
to your junior fans after exams.

456
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,960
Are you not doing your duty today?

457
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,719
Yes! You're right.

458
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,360
Will you excuse me, Charoen?

459
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,440
I am going to go and perform my duty.

460
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,560
I'll be right back for you.

461
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,600
Just go wherever you like, Ton.

462
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,600
Sure.

463
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,880
I'll be back.

464
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,520
I like you, Charoen.

465
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,360
Hello, my lovely young fans.

466
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,319
Ton!

467
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,440
I have a special candy for you guys.

468
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,759
Prepare to catch it.

469
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,799
One, two, three.

470
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,239
Ton! What did you just do?

471
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,520
Let's just say it's a piece of my love.

472
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,639
A piece of love?

473
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,520
How about you get a piece of me?

474
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
Get over here!

475
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,680
Now, with Sun's impending departure…

476
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:07,560
-You want this?
-Alien!

477
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,759
…I'm honestly uncertain about
our future relationship.

478
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,279
What? Free food?

479
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,640
Ongsa.

480
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,080
I'm going to say goodbye to Dear, Vi,
and Kongkwan. I'll catch up with you.

481
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,319
Sure. Should I wait?

482
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,040
It's okay. You go ahead.

483
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,240
See you in a bit then.

484
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,480
Promise me, Sun?

485
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,520
I promise.

486
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:44,799
I'll be right with you.

487
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,640
But in the end,
overthinking things doesn't help.

488
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,600
At some point, all we can do is

489
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,120
live our own lives.

490
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,080
GRADE 11

491
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,160
Hello.

492
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,600
It's seven o'clock now.

493
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,120
You're not up yet?

494
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
Sun, I'm sleepy.

495
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,799
How long are you gonna let me
look at your ear?

496
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,400
Ear?

497
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm sorry, Sun.

498
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,720
I wasn't fully awake.

499
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:00,799
I stayed up late last night reading.

500
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,120
You've been studying harder lately,
Ms. Veterinarian-to-be.

501
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,880
I must study hard.

502
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,839
I'd be devastated if I failed the exam.

503
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,279
Did you just come home?

504
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,240
Yes. I went out shopping
with my host family.

505
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:24,080
It's eight now.

506
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,319
It's about time for me to study.

507
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,279
Get up already.

508
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,560
Go take a shower.

509
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,200
You don't want to be late.

510
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:34,319
I'm taking a shower now.

511
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:38,359
Good. Have fun at school.

512
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,000
Pay attention in class.
Don't chat too much.

513
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
Have fun studying too, Sun.

514
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,880
Good night in advance.

515
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,560
It'll be too late for me to say it
when I get back from school.

516
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,799
Sun.

517
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,640
I miss you.

518
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Be a little more patient.

519
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,520
I miss you too.

520
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,720
I'll be back with you in no time.

521
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,720
Right now, Sun and I live
more than 14,000 kilometers apart.

522
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,880
Our times are 12 hours different.

523
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,279
Though my life in Grade 11
doesn't have Sun…

524
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,839
Write it down. It'll be on the test.

525
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,960
…I have Aylin
who joins our class this year.

526
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,000
We're exploring
ultraviolet radiation today…

527
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,799
She is getting closer to becoming human.

528
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:40,720
Pay attention in class. I love you.

529
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,319
I love, love, love, love you.

530
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,680
From your moon.

531
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,319
Is that from Luna?

532
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,839
-Did Luna write you that?
-Hey!

533
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,359
Aylin! You can't eat that piece of paper.
Spit it out.

534
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,880
She's eating paper again.

535
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,640
-Does it taste good though?
-A bit astringent, I guess.

536
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,279
But I love the fact that Aylin is unique.

537
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,520
Spit it out.

538
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,200
Our seniors have all graduated
and are now university students.

539
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,960
If you want to do Communication Arts,
you can apply many different ways.

540
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,480
But many of them swing by
to visit us often.

541
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,080
I have prepared this for you.

542
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:25,160
As for Teacher Bambam and Teacher Nida,
they are lovely, like always.

543
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,839
I just don't get why I'm always hapless.

544
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,640
Because you are careless.

545
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,160
You were peeling a mango
while watching a video.

546
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,400
But I still don't get it.

547
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,440
You don't get what?

548
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,799
I should've gotten a knife cut
from peeling a mango.

549
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Instead, I got smashed on the hand.

550
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,120
You didn't listen to me.
I warned you to be careful.

551
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I was smashing a santol with a hammer,
but you had to stick your hand there.

552
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,120
You could've just thrown it on the floor.
Nobody smashes them with a hammer.

553
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
If I'd thrown it on the floor,
it would've hit your foot anyway.

554
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,520
See? I'm always considerate
when it comes to you.

555
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
Though they always bicker…

556
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,839
How do we get in?

557
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
…they love each other so much.

558
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,200
This hand of yours is working fine.

559
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:11,440
Can't you just open the door for me?

560
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,520
You used to do everything for me before.

561
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,440
All right, all right.

562
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,799
You remind me of a santol sometimes.

563
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,080
Because I'm sweet?

564
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,440
Because I want to smash you.

565
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,759
Let's go in.

566
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,720
Let me peel it for you.

567
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,279
I wish to pass each subject
on my final exams.

568
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,799
I need good grades
for my college applications.

569
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,839
-Sadhu.
-Sadhu.

570
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,640
Hey. What are you doing here, Ton?

571
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,240
However, there is one pair where
I can't tell if they're in love or not.

572
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:41,440
-Charoen and Ton, to be exact.
-I came to wish

573
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,279
for us to be together forever.

574
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,480
What?

575
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,359
Even though I'm in your friend zone
or brother zone, I am totally okay.

576
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,960
All I want is for you to let me love you.

577
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,799
Because my love stands stronger than
a banyan tree in this temple.

578
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,720
There's no banyan tree in this temple.

579
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:08,880
But there's always the tree of love
I planted for you in my heart.

580
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,880
Reason and logic don't work on them.

581
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,359
Neither does superstition
because they're so unpredictable.

582
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,920
These youngsters.

583
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,520
PHYSICAL SCIENCE

584
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,920
As for Luna and Aylin,
they're still madly in love.

585
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,319
Human senior, I've got a question.

586
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,600
What is the difference between
university life and high school life?

587
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,319
I think they aren't that different.

588
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,240
It's just that you have more freedom.

589
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:50,480
You can manage your own schedule.
There's no morning assembly.

590
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,560
And your classes don't finish
at the same time every day.

591
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,680
But you must be more responsible.

592
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:58,960
And you must work harder.

593
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,000
That sounds difficult.

594
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,240
Are you scared?

595
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,319
A little.

596
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,359
Actually, it isn't that scary.

597
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,279
What can I do
to keep you from being scared?

598
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:24,880
There's a way.

599
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
A way?

600
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,480
What way?

601
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,440
I'm not scared anymore.

602
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,279
You're naughty.

603
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,000
Although Luna is in university
and Aylin is in high school…

604
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,839
love always tilts the Earth
and brings two people closer together.

605
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,839
Aylin.

606
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,920
As for my love,
its definition is still the same.

607
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,080
Waiting for the Sun to come back
as promised.

608
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,879
I've been waiting for almost a year.

609
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,520
Is she sleeping?

610
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,240
Human.

611
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,040
Time for breakfast.

612
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,759
Have you talked to Sun lately?

613
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,120
The other day.

614
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,080
Why?

615
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,359
It's weird.

616
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,640
She normally gives me wake-up calls,

617
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:41,160
but now she isn't even
picking up my calls.

618
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,120
You guys, it's time to eat.

619
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,640
It's a new school year. You don't want
to be late on your first day.

620
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,680
You guys are seniors now.

621
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:53,000
Alpha, Sun isn't picking up my calls.

622
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,879
She might be sleeping.

623
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,839
But she always takes my calls.

624
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,000
Ongsa, don't overthink it.

625
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,920
Good morning, guys.

626
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:11,000
I prepared you a glass of orange juice.

627
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,560
Human senior, when will you go home?

628
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,560
But I'm not the same Ongsa anymore.

629
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,720
The one who was scared,

630
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,000
insecure,

631
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,440
and who only cared about others' opinions.

632
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,400
I'm now the Ongsa who is strong
and gets lots of love from the Sun.

633
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,160
And now,

634
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I'm a girl with more confidence.

635
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,799
Will I make it to school on time?

636
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,240
Did you just move to Bangkok?

637
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:50,560
That's right, senior.

638
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,960
There's only one tip
that will let you get a motorbike taxi.

639
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,879
What tip?

640
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,920
Your fingertip.

641
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,319
Hey. You're so cool.

642
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,319
Remember the tip and use it next time.

643
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,600
Thank you.

644
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,400
-S-Tar, please.
-Hop on.

645
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,920
Just wait for a bit. We are all out.

646
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,480
Sure.

647
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,600
Are you going to S-Tar?

648
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,480
And my wait is finally over.

649
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:58,640
Sun!

650
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,440
How have you been? Did you miss me?

651
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,319
Of course I did.

652
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,359
I missed you so much.

653
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,319
I'm back.

654
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,920
I don't know how our future will play out…

655
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,600
My name is Sun. What's yours?

656
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,319
Nice to meet you, Ongsa.

657
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,799
Even on the toughest day,
something good can happen to you.

658
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,720
…but as long as the Earth
revolves around the Sun,

659
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,720
I shall remain Ongsa, degrees,
the unit of measurement for angles.

660
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,279
Ongsa who is part of the zodiac.

661
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,720
Ongsa who is like a round object
in the sky.

662
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,720
Ongsa who knows the size
and temperature of the Sun so well.

663
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,960
I don't want you to think you are
inferior to anyone.

664
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,759
What you did today was so damn cool.

665
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,920
Because my world revolves around her
who is like the sun.

666
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,759
My world that tilts 23.5 degrees.

667
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,200
I don't know what the destination will be.

668
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,560
But can you please stay with me
until we reach it?

669
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,520
Ongsa whose axis tilts
just to match Sun's orbit.

670
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:12,480
And it will stay like that on repeat
every year for the rest of my life.

671
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,480
Ongsa, it tickles!

672
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:37,400
You've become better at this.

673
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,920
Of course. I learned from the best.

674
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,160
Did you have a passenger while I was away?

675
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,080
I didn't. No one was my passenger.

676
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,720
My passenger can only be you.

677
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,600
Eyes on the road.

678
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,759
Ongsa.
