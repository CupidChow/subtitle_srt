1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,119
So, what's up with you and Sun?

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,120
-You like each other.
-What are you doing?

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,399
But you're not girlfriends.

4
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:09,200
So, what kind of
relationship status is this?

5
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't like Ongsa like this.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,399
She's too pretty.

7
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,920
-Too gorgeous to handle.
-Wait!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,759
-I don't know what you think of him.
-Stop. Just stop.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
But I like you.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,119
I already spoke my mind.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,000
What do you want to do?

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,200
I like you, Sun.

13
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,599
Will you be my girlfriend?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,720
Alpha!

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,040
Alpha!

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,239
I need your help.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,199
Slow down, girl.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,559
What is it?

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,280
Can I borrow a sheet mask?

20
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,960
Sun is video-calling me soon.

21
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,120
A sheet mask?

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
Human, can I borrow…

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,119
There's a panda in the house!

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,840
What was that?

25
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:33,880
Hello, Sun.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,839
Crap! I forgot.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,679
Well, well. Using face masks now, huh?

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,759
Like you're not pretty enough already.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,440
I was preparing my skin for your call.

30
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:00,479
My girlfriend is always cute
regardless of how she looks.

31
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,000
Cute?

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,720
I'm… I'm not cute.

33
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,799
You're so flustered, you're stuttering.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,799
Don't tease me then.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
Fine. I'll stop teasing.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
The stars are beautiful tonight.

37
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,519
Do you see them, Ongsa?

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,799
They're shining so bright.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
I saw them.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,799
They really are beautiful tonight.

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,040
But I think

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
no stars are more beautiful
than my girlfriend.

43
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Hey! You're making me blush.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,320
I'd love to stargaze with you.

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,440
Guys.

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Can you please keep the thing
between Sun and me a secret for now?

47
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,760
It should be known just among us.

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,919
You're with Sun.
Why don't you want people to know that?

49
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,320
If they know someone like me
is dating Sun,

50
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
what will they say?

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,440
But what's wrong
with someone like you, Ongsa?

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,599
Sun is attractive, smart, and athletic.

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
She excels at all she does.

54
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:16,880
Now look at me.

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
I'm a loser. I suck.

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
I excel at nothing.

57
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,360
Humans always have complicated
and useless thoughts.

58
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,960
Listen to me.

59
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
Sun chose to date you.

60
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,080
You should care about her feelings
more than those of others.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm stressed.

62
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,000
It was hard enough before the confession.

63
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,200
Now that we're together, it's even harder.

64
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,560
And what do people
in relationships even do?

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
I don't know how to act.

66
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,440
It's so awkward.

67
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
I get her.

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
She's never been in a relationship before.
It can be difficult.

69
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,440
You humans
had never been in a relationship?

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,440
I know someone who can advise us.

71
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
He was once called

72
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,719
the master of worldly concerns.

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,039
Greetings, Luangpu.

74
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,200
Bless you all, my niece and her friends.

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
What is going on?

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

77
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,520
Is someone hapless again?

78
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,320
It's not haplessness this time.

79
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
It's love.

80
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:42,320
Luangpu, can you enlighten us on how
people in a relationship should act?

81
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Do you think I'm a love guru or what?

82
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,560
Why did you come to me
regarding love issues?

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,919
But my mom told me you were
really something back in the day.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,359
You're a man with years of experience.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,719
Your mom exaggerated.

86
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,080
I've divorced myself
from worldly concerns.

87
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:11,320
But can you please recall your memories?

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,719
We don't know who else to turn to.

89
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,120
You're our last hope, Luangpu.

90
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,840
Love is all about feelings.

91
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,039
When you're committed
to being in a relationship,

92
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,719
nourish and take good care of
your significant other.

93
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,200
No lies.

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,159
But Mom told me that you…

95
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,560
Stop it. Don't talk.

96
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,000
People make mistakes sometimes.

97
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,719
But remember this.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,479
Where there is love, there is lament.

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
Human monk?

100
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,520
Can we get something practical?
Something visually clear?

101
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,039
This is a worldly concern.

102
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,640
I can't help much.

103
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,359
However, in Buddhism,

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
there's a teaching for householders.

105
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,960
It's called The Four Principles
of Gharavasadhamma.

106
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
These are sacca…

107
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,479
-Goodbye, Your Holiness.
-Goodbye, Your Holiness.

108
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,799
Oh my. They're fast.

109
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,120
I wasn't finished speaking yet.

110
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
You said we'd get something.

111
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,799
All we got was a sermon.

112
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,000
I honestly thought Luangpu could help.
I didn't know it'd be like this.

113
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,319
We came all the way here.
What a waste of time.

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,959
He must have truly divorced himself
from worldly concerns.

115
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,120
MERIT TIFFIN BOX

116
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,120
By the way…

117
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,959
You. Alien.

118
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Why did you tag along?

119
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
Well,

120
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:02,160
I wanted to study the behavior of humans
when they're in relationships.

121
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,280
MERIT POSTBOX

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
That's Ton.

123
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,520
Hey, Ton. What are you doing here?

124
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Hey.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,240
My juniors.

126
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,319
I'm here to make merit
for my dedicated fans.

127
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,360
To celebrate 50,000 subscribers
on my channel.

128
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Congrats, Ton.

129
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,480
Right. Thanks.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,560
So, what are you guys doing at the temple?

131
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,680
Are you here for social work?

132
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,959
No.

133
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,920
I took Ongsa to Luangpu to get some advice
regarding worldly concerns.

134
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,959
Worldly concerns?

135
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
-Ongsa wants to know…
-Hey.

136
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,760
Let's not talk about it, Charoen.

137
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,880
What exactly do
people in relationships do?

138
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,839
Ongsa has no clue how to act around Sun.

139
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,400
You've just met the right person,
youngsters.

140
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,520
I, Mr. Ton, will teach you
just what people in relationships do.

141
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
Okay.

142
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,600
We've found a way, Ongsa.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,480
What are you two doing?

144
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,959
Why are you looking so down?

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,920
Ton said

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,600
people in relationships go out on dates,

147
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,920
and that the first date
typically involves watching a movie.

148
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,280
And?

149
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
And it must be a romantic movie.

150
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,959
So?

151
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,560
When the crucial moment comes,

152
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:17,600
you strike.

153
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
Strike?

154
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
Put your mouth on the other person's.

155
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,199
Kiss.

156
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,199
What the heck, you guys?

157
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,160
I thought it was something serious.

158
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,640
This is ridiculous.

159
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,680
Why would humans
put their mouths on others' mouths?

160
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,760
The exams are approaching.

161
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,000
Sun might not be up for dating.

162
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,319
Ongsa, want to see a movie
at my place tomorrow?

163
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,760
What's the matter now?

164
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,160
Sun asked me to watch a movie
at her house.

165
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,120
Is this like a date?

166
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,079
It's our first date, isn't it?

167
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,439
Alpha, what should I do?

168
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
What should I do?

169
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,360
Alpha, why would humans put their mouths
on the mouths of other humans?

170
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,760
A meteor shower watch party at the school?

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,920
What are you thinking?

172
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:42,880
This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity
to see a meteor shower clearly.

173
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,400
If we don't set up the activity for this
Friday, we'll miss the chance.

174
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,079
It's unsafe to let students
come to school at night.

175
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,400
What if something bad happens?

176
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,680
I will ensure their safety.
It's my duty to do so.

177
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,160
You can't even ensure your own.

178
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,000
You're hapless and unlucky.
You trip and fall.

179
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,079
You can't take care of
a bunch of students.

180
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,599
Only members of the Astronomy Club
and the Mysterious Stories Club

181
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,920
will be allowed to come.

182
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,439
That amount, I can monitor.

183
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,439
That's still a lot.
You can't take care of them.

184
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,800
So because I'm hapless,

185
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
the students won't get to see
the meteor shower.

186
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,640
How about this?

187
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
If you want to set up this activity,
I'll help supervise.

188
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,520
Why would you help me?

189
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
You are unlucky, and I am lucky.

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,240
I can balance out your bad luck
and keep bad things from happening.

191
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
That's absurd.

192
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,120
How would that help? I don't believe you.

193
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,199
If you don't believe me,
walk out of this room and see.

194
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,120
Sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry.

195
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,280
See? Believe me now?

196
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,439
You need me, Teacher Bambam.

197
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,479
I'm so glad we're watching
this movie this evening.

198
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,839
I didn't watch it before
because I wanted to watch it with you.

199
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,479
Is it that good?

200
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,719
Yes.

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,120
I read the reviews.
Everyone says it was fantastic.

202
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,360
It made their hearts beat so fast
the entire time.

203
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,959
It must be really good for our souls.

204
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,240
Based on that info,

205
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,120
it's a romantic movie for sure.

206
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,199
Watching a romantic movie alone with Sun…

207
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,400
The thought of it…

208
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,479
makes my heart pound.

209
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,920
Today is full of good things.

210
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
One happens to be
this choc mint ice cream.

211
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,520
I love choc mint.

212
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,280
Is it that good?

213
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,479
Yes.

214
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,479
Have you not had it before?

215
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Wanna try?

216
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,120
Holy shit.

217
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,959
This is like

218
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
an indirect kiss.

219
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:40,920
Well…

220
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
It's good.

221
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,880
Right?

222
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,520
Only people with good taste
love choc mint.

223
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,719
Ongsa.

224
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,199
Do you know that I never feel embarrassed

225
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,599
about being with you?

226
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,839
And I don't care about
what other people think.

227
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,560
I only care about you.

228
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,719
But if you're not ready
to tell other people yet, it's fine.

229
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,319
We don't have to tell anyone yet.

230
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:34,160
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
just because we're together.

231
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:41,599
Actually, I'm worried that
I'm not a good girlfriend for you.

232
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:47,839
But I don't really know about the things
that people in relationships do.

233
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Well,

234
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,680
just those things…

235
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,719
that people in relationships do.

236
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,040
Like what?

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,280
Is there anything you want me to do?

238
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,119
Anything?

239
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
Yes, anything.

240
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,200
I want…

241
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,159
I want you to

242
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
make a move on me.

243
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,080
What?

244
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,639
Make a move?

245
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,879
Come on, Ongsa.

246
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,800
Fight. Be bold.

247
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,399
Make a move?

248
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,240
Of course.

249
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,200
Once we get to the crucial moment,

250
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,200
the romantic scene,

251
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,320
prepare for it, Sun.

252
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,680
I will just get closer to her

253
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,440
and strike hard!

254
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,399
Yes, shoot them! Shoot them down.

255
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,240
That was unexpected.

256
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,000
Shoot it! Go left. Left.

257
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,440
Bang, bang, bang. Yes!

258
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,919
I didn't know you liked action movies.

259
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
I thought you meant a romantic movie.

260
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:39,800
You said it made people's hearts pound.

261
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,120
It does.

262
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,960
Isn't your heart pounding?

263
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,520
My heart is beating crazy fast right now.

264
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,399
Feel it. It's an adrenaline rush.

265
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,080
The crucial moment…

266
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,120
If you can't find it,

267
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,399
you can just make it, Ongsa.

268
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,080
Do it.

269
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
Make a move!

270
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,840
Shoot!

271
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,399
Sun.

272
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:13,919
I want…

273
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Why did you slap me?

274
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
A mosquito. It was biting your cheek.

275
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
The first attempt failed.

276
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,000
Move on to the second.

277
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,440
Start over. Keep fighting, Ongsa.

278
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,639
You can do it.

279
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
Sun,

280
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,240
look at me.

281
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes.

282
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey.

283
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
Your brows are growing.

284
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,679
What?

285
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,040
Your eyebrows are spreading.
Should I trim them for you?

286
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,840
Sun, don't look at my brows.

287
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
Look into my eyes.

288
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,600
Hey.

289
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,760
Your lips are so dry.

290
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,320
-Mission failed. No kiss tonight.
-Let me grab some lip balm.

291
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,120
Done.

292
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

293
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,520
Ongsa, you're pretty good
at taking the initiative.

294
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,240
This Friday night,

295
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,879
I'm hosting a meteor shower watch party
at the school.

296
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:09,120
This is a miraculous event,

297
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,000
as it's the most visible meteor shower
we've had in 80 years.

298
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,320
It will be so bright that even people
in Bangkok will be able to see it.

299
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,760
So, I'm inviting you all to watch it
with me at school.

300
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,000
If it's bright enough
to be seen in Bangkok,

301
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,280
why not watch it at home?

302
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Please let me finish.

303
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,120
There's a reason for this.

304
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
According to school tradition,

305
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,080
couples who view a meteor shower together
are said to have a lucky love life.

306
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,080
Our first school principal

307
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,520
got married to the one he confessed
his love to during a meteor shower.

308
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Really?

309
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,639
Really.

310
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,399
You have to find out for yourself.

311
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,600
Humans are gullible.

312
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,360
So you're not coming?

313
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,200
-I am.
-What?

314
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,639
The first date was a failure. That's fine.

315
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
On the second date,

316
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
my kiss will make you weak in the knees.

317
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,919
I don't get Teacher Bambam.

318
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,480
Why would she want to host
a meteor shower watch party at school?

319
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,480
Right.

320
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,600
And Teacher Nida actually let her.

321
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,960
They're usually on opposite sides.

322
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,760
Teacher Bambam must have been
very persistent with her.

323
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,560
But what I don't get is, why at school?

324
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,960
I don't get that either.

325
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,480
That's because of
our school's mysterious tale.

326
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
That's why.

327
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,720
What tale are you talking about, Ton?

328
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,280
The tale that might give you a chance.

329
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:31,760
Chance?

330
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,159
What chance?

331
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Mawin, my dear friend,

332
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,960
your chance is here.

333
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,919
What chance?

334
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,480
The chance for you and Tinh to happen.

335
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,960
Do you know anything
about the school tale?

336
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,679
No. What tale?

337
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:57,800
It's said that if we watch
a meteor shower with someone we like,

338
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,159
our love wish will be granted.

339
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,000
Who said it?

340
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
"Who said it?"

341
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
Teacher Bambam did.

342
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:10,480
Mawin.

343
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,720
This is a great chance for you

344
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,600
to get together with the person
you've had a crush on forever.

345
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
Ask him to watch it with you.

346
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
After that meteor night,

347
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,560
you and Tinh will become boyfriends.

348
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:28,120
Mawin, I hope you don't
believe this nonsense.

349
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,159
Mawin.

350
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
-Damn it, my friend.
-That's my boy.

351
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,120
Human.

352
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,679
Human senior.

353
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,800
How should I say it?

354
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,720
WA…

355
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,040
Why is it so hard to be human?

356
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,760
Hey! What are you…?

357
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,480
WATCH THE STARS WITH ME.

358
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,800
Oh, look. You're back.

359
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,760
Do you have to look that serious?

360
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,879
What do you say, human senior?
Wanna watch the stars with me or not?

361
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,480
Is this how aliens ask someone
to watch the stars with them?

362
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,800
I guess.

363
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,639
Pretty cute.

364
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,679
You want to watch
the meteor shower with me?

365
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,000
If I do, will you watch it with me?

366
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,480
Of course.

367
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,360
I want to see it with you too.

368
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,240
It's not every day that you get to see
stars with an alien, right?

369
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,720
How can I miss it?

370
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,360
Let's watch it on the rooftop.

371
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,679
Just the two of us.

372
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,320
Just the two of us.

373
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,159
This is like a date.

374
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,360
It's just stargazing, human senior.
Don't assume things.

375
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,000
Hey!

376
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,439
Will it really work?

377
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,120
Of course it will if you trust me.

378
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,919
-Are we really doing this?
-We are.

379
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,240
Trust me.

380
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,560
-Let's go. Go!
-All right, fine.

381
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,520
Tinh.

382
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Oh, hey, Mawin.

383
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,199
What is it?

384
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,959
I… you…

385
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
It's…

386
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,720
"It's…" what?

387
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,600
Would you like to watch
the meteor shower with me?

388
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,240
You're asking me to watch
the meteor shower with you?

389
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,959
Right.

390
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,919
But if you don't want to, it's fine.

391
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,080
Why are you asking me?

392
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,040
Because…

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,360
Well, I…

394
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,080
-I…
-You what?

395
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,240
Well…

396
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,720
For your online content.

397
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Content?

398
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,600
Um, content like…

399
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:39,000
Content like, "Watch the meteor shower
with the student vice president."

400
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,560
Hey, that's actually interesting.

401
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:45,760
Can I think about it first?

402
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,159
Of course.

403
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,919
Bye.

404
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,520
-He said…
-He said…?

405
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,800
-He would think about it.
-He would think about it!

406
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:03,840
-He didn't…
-He didn't reject you.

407
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,439
METEOR SHOWER DAY

408
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,560
Sadhu.

409
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,399
Angels high above, can you hear me?

410
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,199
It's the meteor shower day today.

411
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,080
Please come down
and give everyone your blessings.

412
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,800
Dear angels,

413
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,639
can you all hear me?

414
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,439
-Today is the meteor shower day.
-Who's chiming the bell so loud?

415
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,600
Please hear my prayer.

416
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,600
Hey.

417
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,439
Hey, Ton.

418
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,399
Ton.

419
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,199
Charoen.

420
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,679
Ton.

421
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,080
What are you doing here, Charoen?

422
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
My mom asked me to bring Luangpu
this tiffin box.

423
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,679
He's not out
to receive food offerings today.

424
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
And you?

425
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,280
Why did you come here to chime the bell?

426
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,840
It's a noise disturbance.

427
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,040
It's the meteor shower night tonight.

428
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,159
So I came here to chime the bell,

429
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,800
asking the angels to come down
and grant everyone's wishes tonight.

430
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,240
I think you've
misunderstood something here.

431
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:39,320
What have I misunderstood?

432
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,199
Luangpu said

433
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,959
chiming a bell
is a kind of meditative practice,

434
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,800
not a way to summon angels
like you believe.

435
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,719
But according to my research,
it's what it's all about,

436
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,120
and those who told me were old people.

437
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,840
But you can't chime the bell
non-stop like this in the morning.

438
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,240
I can do it whenever I want

439
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,360
because I am Ton.

440
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,800
Do as you please then.

441
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:12,840
Will you excuse me?

442
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,679
Hold on.

443
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:22,199
Do you have a partner
to watch the meteor shower with?

444
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,919
No.

445
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,199
No one asked me.

446
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,480
But that's fine.

447
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,840
I plan to see it by myself at home.

448
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,959
Aw, poor Charoen.

449
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,120
It must be so lonely
to spend time by yourself.

450
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,280
No way, Ton.

451
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,040
You can't let Charoen, who's been gushing
over your handsomeness for so long,

452
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,679
be lonely on such a lovely day.

453
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,000
If we're done here, please excuse me.

454
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,959
I have to bring this to Luangpu
for food offerings.

455
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Hold on, Charoen.

456
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,919
Tonight,

457
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:05,600
will you go watch
the meteor shower with me?

458
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:07,639
Oh, dear Lord.

459
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,439
It's almost time.

460
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,040
Why are the students not here yet?

461
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,360
It's because you told them

462
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:38,240
that they'd be lucky in love
if they watched meteor showers at school.

463
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,639
Not to mention bring up
the former principal's wife.

464
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,360
They are out watching the meteor shower
in pairs now.

465
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,560
What about our activity?

466
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,399
Bummer!

467
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
I brought a camera hoping to capture
some moments with the children.

468
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,280
It's just the two of us now.

469
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:01,879
Well then,

470
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,800
should we watch the shower together?

471
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,240
Sure.

472
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,839
Since we're here,
let's snap some photos together.

473
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,120
Move closer.

474
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,400
Teacher Nida,
what's with that look on your face?

475
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,600
Smile.

476
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,319
Right.

477
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,719
This is a bit hard.

478
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,520
How about I take the photos?

479
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
You're pretty clumsy.

480
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,679
Sounds good.

481
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,319
Where are the falling stars?

482
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,920
Move it over here.

483
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,920
There. We can see the stars now.

484
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,120
Ready.

485
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,159
Pretty.

486
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,639
We captured lots of stars.

487
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,720
But you need a bigger smile.

488
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,759
You have cute smiles.

489
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:01,759
Sure.

490
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,160
Hey, look. We snapped it
when the stars were falling.

491
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,279
Do you think
the tale Teacher Bambam told is true?

492
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,279
Humans are usually delusional.

493
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,799
It's good for humans
to be delusional sometimes.

494
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,319
Look! The falling stars.

495
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,799
Let's make a wish.

496
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:49,240
What are you doing?

497
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,480
Why are you writing on the ground?

498
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm making a wish.

499
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
What?

500
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,000
By doing this?

501
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,960
Yes.

502
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,440
I'm making a wish in Morse code.

503
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:12,160
What are you wishing for?

504
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,000
Translate it if you want to know.

505
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,880
If what the human teacher said is true,

506
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,080
tell me how you feel, human senior.

507
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,120
Well, how do you write "2" in Morse code?

508
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,799
Dot, dot, dash, dash, dash.

509
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:25,480
Now read it again.

510
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,880
Human senior!

511
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,799
What?

512
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,600
When humans confess their love,
this is what they do.

513
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,040
This is it.

514
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,920
The benefits of being human.

515
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,120
Do you want to try?

516
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,799
Charoenporn.

517
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,279
Knock, knock. Is Charoenporn here?

518
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,120
Hey.

519
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,319
Charoenporn.

520
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,080
It's not the time for superstition.

521
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,920
What? But…

522
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,920
We're here to make a wish upon
the meteor shower, right?

523
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,960
There's nothing as magical
as these bougainvilleas from me.

524
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,120
Why are you giving me bougainvilleas?

525
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,160
Don't you know

526
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,040
bougainvilleas become more lively
in hot conditions?

527
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,279
Yes.

528
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
So?

529
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,799
You are so hot.

530
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,319
If these bougainvilleas are near you,

531
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,520
they must be lively,

532
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,600
and spectacularly beautiful.

533
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
What the hell are you saying, Ton?

534
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:36,080
From this moment on, I, Ton,

535
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,440
will not belong to everyone anymore.

536
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,640
Because I will belong only to you,

537
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
and you forever.

538
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,200
Something must have gone wrong.

539
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,080
Will you be my girlfriend?

540
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,759
No. I like it better
when you belong to everyone.

541
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,960
-Ton. Don't belong to me. Let go, Ton.
-Listen to me.

542
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,640
Let go. I said let go!

543
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,720
Goodbye.

544
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,240
Mawin.

545
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,520
Yes?

546
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,759
Where is your precious Tinh?

547
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,200
He's not coming.

548
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:35,799
He messaged me saying
he's binge-watching a TV series.

549
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,040
Teacher Bambam must have fooled us.

550
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,520
The tale isn't real.

551
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,600
But why are you here?

552
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,319
Well, I…

553
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,319
I came to give you these flowers.

554
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:33,480
So beautiful.

555
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
Yes, they are.

556
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Are you cold, Sun?

557
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,319
I am.

558
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:47,480
It might be because
we're in the middle of a field.

559
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,520
An open space.

560
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,799
This is totally a scene
straight out of a romantic movie.

561
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,000
It's truly the crucial moment.

562
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,319
Why did you give it to me?
You must be cold.

563
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,440
It's okay.

564
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
I'm not cold.

565
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,960
Thank you.

566
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,160
What a handsome move, Ongsa.

567
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,920
But it's getting a little cold here.

568
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,240
Are you sure you're not cold?

569
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,000
I swear.

570
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
You don't have to swear.

571
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Thank you.

572
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,000
If we kiss under a meteor shower,

573
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,799
it will be a super romantic scene.

574
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,520
Ongsa, you're so cold
your teeth are chattering.

575
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,279
Oh, gosh! You suck, Ongsa.

576
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,600
You can't even create a romantic scene.

577
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,680
What a loser.

578
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,240
Let's get warm together.

579
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,879
Is the Earth tilting or what?

580
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:47,279
Yes.

581
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,720
At a very good angle.

582
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,920
I don't mind it tilting more often then.

583
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:56,160
Ongsa,

584
00:43:58,279 --> 00:43:59,520
I have something to tell you.

585
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:02,400
What is it?

586
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,879
Remember when you asked me

587
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,080
how people in relationships should act?

588
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:14,960
I think you can just be yourself

589
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
as you are right now.

590
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,319
You don't have to act cool
like heroes in movies.

591
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,600
Just be yourself.

592
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,120
Be who you are.

593
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,160
It's enough

594
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,319
to make me want to kiss you.

595
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,879
What did you just say?

596
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:45,920
Well,

597
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:49,319
what I'm saying is…

598
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,920
Hey. Falling stars!

599
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,240
Wow.

600
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,319
Though there may have been
some hiccups earlier,

601
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,600
this first kiss was so damn romantic.

602
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,640
You look extra pretty today.

603
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,200
Well, this is suspicious.

604
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:13,879
Aylin and I are girlfriends.

605
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,120
What?

606
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,000
My mom and dad asked you to come over
and have a meal with us.

607
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,799
And why did you only just tell me now?

608
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,920
Why are you up so late tonight?

609
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,960
You're usually sleeping by now.

610
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,080
I guess I'm so happy
that I don't want tonight to end.

611
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:32,240
-What time is it now?
-Human cousin is being weird today.

612
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,440
What's the matter?

613
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,160
Alpha must be tired.

614
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,200
Despite how she appears,
she's very stressed.

615
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:41,240
Why am I always the last person
to know things about you guys?

616
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,319
I know less than Luna does.

617
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,120
The student exchange program in the USA
that you asked about

618
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,240
is now accepting applications.

619
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,000
-Ongsa, is this how you want to play?
-Ongsa is crazy in love.

620
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,920
I can't imagine her not seeing you
for even just a few days.

621
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,480
I'm sure she would be devastated.
