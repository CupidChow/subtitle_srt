1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,880
Then listen to me carefully, Ongsa.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,159
What you did today was so damn cool.

3
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:08,760
If this is the light from a UFO,

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,799
it's the only chance to meet my friends.

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:14,280
So, we're friends from now on, Aylin.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,760
Are you all right, human?

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,599
-Is it about Sun?
-Please don't tell anyone about this.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,119
About human Ongsa liking human Sun?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,320
-Hey!
-What?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
-Ongsa, you like Sun?
-Hey!

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Tinh, Ongsa likes Sun.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,559
You're missing it.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
Serves you right. You're a sinner.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,199
It's karma for not joining me
for the evening prayer.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm hanging up. The end. Bye.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,960
It's not like that.
You're misunderstanding.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,120
High-pitched voice.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,680
You definitely like her.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,040
Guys,

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,239
please don't tell anybody about this.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
Please.

22
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:55,400
I already told Tinh.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,839
But we won't tell anyone else.

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,919
We're friends.
We keep each other's secrets.

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,399
Love is normal for humans.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
You can like or love
anyone you want, human.

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,759
But isn't it weird

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,520
that I…

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,280
like Sun?

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,200
How is that weird?

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,800
Well,

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
because I'm a girl

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,240
and Sun is also a girl.

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,800
That's not weird at all.

35
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,399
Tinh once told me he liked men

36
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,720
and I like everyone.

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,479
But I don't like any human being.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Ongsa, do you want me and Tinh
to help you with Sun?

39
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:42,800
Hey! No!

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,720
No!

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,199
Can I have your date of birth?

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,759
What do you want with it?

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,280
I'm using it to check your horoscope
to see if it matches Sun's.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,440
What? No!

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,640
No! No way. Nope.

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
Humans are credulous.

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, Aylin.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
-Aylin, wait.
-Hey.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,920
Hey! Ongsa, wait.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
Give me more updates! I want to know!

51
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,679
Club Fair Day is around the corner.

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,119
Think of the activity your club will host.

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,480
What activity is your club hosting, Alpha?

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
No activities
for the Student Committee Club.

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,119
Our job is to maintain
the orderliness of the event.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,160
What about your club, Ton?
What will you do?

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,679
It's the Mysterious Stories Club.
We're doing a haunted house, of course.

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,399
Wait and see.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
Everyone is going to want
to visit my club.

60
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,679
I guarantee it.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,000
By the way,
what will the Astronomy Club do?

62
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,560
I don't know yet.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,839
You don't know yet?

64
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,680
Are you sure you can run the club at all?

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,479
Hey!

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
How about you just terminate it?

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,159
Ton, you'll see.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,800
My Astronomy Club will get more attention
than your stupid superstitious club.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Can you actually do that?

70
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,640
Of course I can!

71
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,640
-If you think you can, bring it on.
-Game on.

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,120
-That's fierce.
-You…

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,599
Hey! You missed.

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,039
Be prepared.

75
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm going to overthrow you this year.

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Long reigning champion, huh?
This year, I'm going to be the winner.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,240
-Hey! Don't hit me with that. It hurts.
-Got it?

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,719
-Put it down.
-I'm hitting you with two books now.

79
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,599
This is the pride of the Astronomy Club.

80
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
We believe in science.

81
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,000
We'll never let any superstitious clubs
look down on us.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,440
So what do you want us to do, Luna?

83
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,719
The goal is to get as many people
to visit our club as possible.

84
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,400
More than the number that visit
Ton's haunted house.

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
But the haunted house is hosted every year

86
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,039
and has always been
the most successful activity.

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,000
Based on that fact, Luna,

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,599
I don't think we can beat them.

89
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,640
Hey, don't be afraid.

90
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,919
Don't be discouraged.

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sure there must be a way.

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
You guys have any ideas?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,599
How about an astronomical exhibition?

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
It would fit well in academic events,

95
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,280
but this is the club fair.

96
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,440
It must be something fun.

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,200
It must draw a huge amount
of attention from students.

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,960
That's difficult.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Let's do this.

100
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
You guys go home and think about it.

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,799
Tomorrow, we'll discuss
your thoughts, okay?

102
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,560
Okay?

103
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,960
Ongsa.

104
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,120
Ongsa. Look.

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,080
Hey, Tinh, don't. Don't film me.

106
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't you want to be in my vlog?

107
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,359
No. Your channel is full of weird stuff.

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
Ongsa! What day did your birthday fall on?

109
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,400
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, or Sun?

110
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,039
I was born on a Tuesday.

HOROSCOPE AND ASTROLOGY

112
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,479
"People born on a Tuesday
are straightforward.

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
They are bold and brave.

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,880
They have a strong personality
in others' opinions.

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,840
People born on a Tuesday are givers.

116
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,280
When in love, they are madly in love.

117
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,719
They are clingy and always like
to spend time with their loved ones.

118
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,400
They are good caretakers of their lovers."

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Hey! Can you read my horoscope too?
I was born on a Monday.

120
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,479
Come on, Monday. Quick.

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,159
Monday.

122
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,120
Monday.

123
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,239
-Hey!
-What?

124
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,000
"People born on a Monday are enemies
of those born on a Thursday."

125
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,479
No!

126
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,280
Who was born on a Thursday?

127
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,799
Me.

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,080
That's why I don't quite like you.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,440
I don't think you and your book
make sense.

130
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,919
Hey. Tinh, easy there.

131
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,400
Let's make peace.

132
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,000
Checking your horoscope?

133
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,640
Yes, we are.
Do you want to check yours too, Sun?

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I do.

135
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
I like having my fortune told so much.

136
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,719
I was born on a Friday.

137
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,679
Friday?

138
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,039
"Those born on Friday are charming

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,320
and enjoy talking.

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,440
They are suitable
for rhetoric-oriented tasks.

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
They like to seek out activities
and ask their lovers to join them.

142
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,919
People will never be bored around them.

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,799
Lastly, those born on a Friday are
compatible with those born on a Tuesday."

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,919
Hey.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,039
Ongsa was born on a Tuesday.

146
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,919
Well…

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Really?

148
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,800
That's why I feel like
we hit it off so well.

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,079
It's because our fortunes are compatible.

150
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,920
I think so too.

151
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
I never thought Sun
would believe in stuff like this.

152
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,760
How cute.

That's why I feel like

Our fortunes are compatible.

157
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,680
Crap.

158
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,319
COMPATIBLE…

EARTH, WHAT DAY
DID YOUR BIRTHDAY FALL ON?

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,839
What day did your birthday fall on?

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,439
Tuesday.

162
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,120
Really?

163
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:18,439
I heard that people born on a Tuesday are
compatible with those born on a Friday.

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,199
What does compatible mean?

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,640
You really don't know,
or you're just messing with me?

166
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,760
Kidding!

167
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,680
And what day did your birthday fall on?

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,959
Don't tell me it was a Friday.

169
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,319
How do you know?

170
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
I took a guess.

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,600
In case we're compatible.

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you like having your fortune told?

173
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
It's fun.

174
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,600
How so?

175
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,360
I don't know.

176
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,400
I just know that fortune-telling
can't be explained scientifically.

177
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,000
So…

178
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,400
do you believe it?

179
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,199
Do I?

180
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,600
I guess I do.

181
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,439
Fortune-telling is like feeling something.

182
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,680
If you feel it's right, it's right.

183
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,199
No logic.

184
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,319
That's true.

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,400
I guess it's because feelings
aren't something you can explain.

186
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,959
Sometimes, the foretelling
just highlights what we already feel.

187
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
That's the reason why

188
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,079
it's sometimes more fun
than science to me.

189
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,120
Fortune-telling is like feeling something.

190
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,199
If you feel it's right, it's right.

191
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,600
That's the reason why it's sometimes
more fun than science to me.

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,480
Hey!

193
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,480
I've got it.

194
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,680
NO HUMANS ALLOWED WITHOUT PERMISSION
PRESS THE BUTTON TO CALL

195
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,959
Aylin.

196
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Aylin.

197
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,199
What is it, human?

198
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,240
I know what activity our club will host.

199
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,120
You want to hear it?

200
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,199
Shut the door, human.

201
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,360
ASTRONOMY CLUB

202
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,800
This activity is called
astrological fortune-telling.

203
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,880
It's a fortune-telling activity
held by our Astronomy Club.

204
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,719
Everyone is welcome to join us.

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,959
We'll give them scientific
and astrological information together.

206
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,800
How, Ongsa?

207
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,680
I can't picture it just yet.

208
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,599
We'll tell them their ruling planets
based on their date of birth,

209
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,760
zodiac constellations, and signs.

210
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,079
We'll explain to them what they are,
how far from the Earth,

211
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,280
and which direction
they should look to see them.

212
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,959
And what about the astrological part?
Where do we gather the info?

213
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,719
I borrowed this from a friend.

214
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Aylin and I believe this will help draw
more attention to our club.

215
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:38,120
Who knows? I might beat
the Mysterious Stories' haunted house.

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,839
It's not like everyone likes ghosts.

217
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,640
But almost everyone likes
getting their fortune told.

218
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,800
Wow! That's great.

219
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,640
I'm buying this idea.

220
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,760
Let's do it.

221
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:55,520
Ongsa and Aylin, you guys are geniuses.
How did you come up with it?

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,160
It was Ongsa's idea.

223
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,400
I just agreed to it.

224
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,880
My dear juniors,

225
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,760
if we beat Ton's club,
I'll treat you all to boba tea.

226
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,920
I don't like boba tea.

227
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
But I do.

228
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,199
I do too.

229
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,439
Yeah! It's on me.

230
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,719
Let's fight.

231
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,880
Can I see the book?

232
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,599
The Prophecy Tome:
Mastering the Art of Fortune-telling.

233
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,839
The more I read, the more fun it gets.

234
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,719
See?

235
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,920
I told you.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,520
TAROT CARD READING MANUAL

237
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Ongsa, are you all right?

238
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
I found this.

239
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,439
"It's stated in some books
that borrowing power from the stars

240
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,880
to foretell someone's fortune

241
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,560
requires you to sell the power
of your own soul.

242
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
The more accurate the prophecy,

243
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,160
the more soul power you will lose."

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,160
So, we…

245
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,280
That's bull.

246
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,120
There's no such thing as soul power.

247
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,760
But it sounds scary, Aylin.

248
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,000
Right.

249
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,360
I'll read it to you then.

250
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,040
"Aries people are charming,
strong, and lively.

251
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,120
Aries people are attractive, brave…"

252
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,719
That was dope!

253
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,719
Too bad I didn't record it.

254
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,439
You're ridiculous, human senior.

255
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,120
What did you just say?

256
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:39,959
Nothing.

257
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,280
Guys, let's call it a day.

258
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,880
Go home and rest.

259
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
Let's recharge our soul power.

260
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,160
Come on, let's go. Grab your things.

261
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,240
Come on.

262
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,200
Grab your stuff. Come on.

263
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,359
And this one.

264
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
Why is it like this?

265
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,200
EARTH JUST SHARED A PHOTO

266
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
HEART SHAKEN

267
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
What are you doing?

268
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,040
Human senior.

269
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
Reading?

270
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,600
Be quiet. I need to focus.

271
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,399
Okay. Quiet.

272
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,240
Why are you staring? I can't focus.

273
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,399
Is it so wrong to look?

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,879
Why don't you practice fortune reading?

275
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
Practicing fortune reading? Me?

276
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,200
Yes.

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,440
You must be our club's fortune teller,
human senior.

278
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,960
Says who?

279
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,879
Who told you I must?

280
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
Aylin and I?

281
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
Yes.

282
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,000
You two will be our fortune tellers
on Club Fair Day.

283
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,919
But, Luna,

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,320
we're not fit to be fortune tellers.

285
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:06,560
Why not?

286
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,720
I talked to Sun.

287
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,960
You two are the best fit.

288
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,600
Ongsa, you came up with the idea.

289
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,280
You understand it the best.

290
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,840
Aylin is the best among us
when it comes to information.

291
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,440
But…

292
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
Luna and I will promote the activity.

293
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,679
We'll also be the receptionists and assist
you two throughout the readings.

294
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,399
Right.

295
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,120
Because Sun and I are our best shot
at getting people to join our activity

296
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
because we're popular.

297
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:44,760
Any arguments?

298
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,480
Ongsa, you can do it.

299
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,760
Just do your best, you two.

300
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,520
Come on. Be brave. Fight it.

301
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
I don't think I can do it.

302
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,639
I can't even talk to people I don't know.

303
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,960
But with this, I have to
tell their fortunes and give them advice.

304
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,159
And I don't know how to talk to humans.

305
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,159
I know you guys are introverts.
So, let's do this.

306
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,360
I'll help bring out
the extrovertness in you.

307
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:31,600
What's an introvert?

308
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,840
You two are perfect cousins.

309
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:40,879
Let's just say Charoenporn
and I will help you.

310
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,000
How about we start by practicing
how to talk like fortune tellers?

311
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,960
How?

312
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,879
Welcome to the Astronomy Club.

313
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm the fortune teller.

314
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,840
Today, I'll read you
your fortunes and predictions.

315
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,159
There.

316
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,840
Gosh! Stop it.

317
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,200
I don't think it'll work.

318
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
Question. Are you guys home all day?

319
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,399
We're not going anywhere.

320
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,879
Why?

321
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,679
Charoen and I will drop by.

322
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,520
You two seriously need some training.

323
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay? See you. Charoen, I'm calling you.

324
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:27,840
Sure.

325
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,080
These are all we have.

326
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,600
Should we go buy some more

327
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,080
in case those two want something else?

328
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,320
If they can finish all this,
they aren't humans.

329
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,120
Yeah. True.

330
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:53,840
Why do you seem thrilled?

331
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,560
I am thrilled.

332
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,040
I've never had friends over before.

333
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
Me neither.

334
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,200
Hey.

335
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,439
That must be them.

336
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,679
Aylin, come on.

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,240
You're here.

338
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,639
-Hi, Ongsa.
-Hi, Ongsa.

339
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,919
Hi.

340
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
Hi, Ongsa.

341
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,000
Hi, Sun.

342
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,200
Come in.

343
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,840
You can leave your shoes there.

344
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,879
-Sure.
-Okay.

345
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,080
Aylin, lead the way.

346
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Hey, Sun. Let me.

347
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,960
Thank you.

348
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,040
Having friends over
for the first time is hard enough,

349
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,800
but having Sun over
turns my stomach completely upside down.

350
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,520
We met Sun on the way here,
so we invited her along

351
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,040
in case she could help with anything.

352
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm sorry for coming here unannounced,
Aylin, Ongsa.

353
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,919
It's fine.

354
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,240
Are you feeling uncomfortable?
If so, I can leave.

355
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,840
Oh, don't. I…

356
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,840
I'm glad you came to help.

357
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,760
No problem at all.

358
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,040
I brought you more books.

359
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,840
If you two can't pass
for fortune tellers today,

360
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,919
we won't leave this place.

361
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
We're staying.

362
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,439
This is for you, Ongsa.

363
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
How To Be a Fortune Teller.

364
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,280
And this one is for you, Alien.

365
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,280
The Art of Talking.

366
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,399
Take it.

367
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,360
For our Astronomy Club, keep fighting.

368
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,760
-Ongsa, you need a cape.
-Aylin!

369
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,720
Hand up.

370
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,159
-Like this?
-Not like that, Tinh.

371
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,320
-Yes, like this.
-Like this.

372
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:45,800
-Here.
-There you go.

373
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:46,879
There.

374
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,919
Oh, I have a headscarf.

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,919
-I'm coming.
-Headscarf.

376
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,960
Don't check it yet. We're not done.

377
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
-Hey, where are you going?
-Where are you going?

378
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,720
-Come back.
-Attach it here.

379
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,879
Aylin.

380
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,280
Aylin, hold this.

381
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,480
-Try it.
-Hold it.

382
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,080
Smile. Smile a little more.

383
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,439
Thank you all so much for today.

384
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,879
My pleasure.

385
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,879
I'm happy to help again anytime.

386
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,320
I will root for you on Club Fair Day.

387
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:25,960
Though I'm in the Mysterious Stories Club,
I'm supporting you two. Keep fighting.

388
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,280
I'm blessed.

389
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,120
Our ride is here. Let's go, Charoen.

390
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,679
-We're leaving.
-Bye.

391
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,639
Come on.

392
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Get home safe.

393
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,720
Bye, human Sun.

394
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,199
Thank you so much for today, Sun.

395
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,199
It's okay. We're in the same club.

396
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:00,320
Oh, how will you get home?
Did you book a ride?

397
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,000
I came with Sunny.

398
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,280
Sunny?

399
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,240
Sunny.

400
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,240
My bike.

401
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you.

402
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,280
Too many thank-yous now.

403
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,840
You already said that.

404
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,560
I mean, thank you for dropping by.

405
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,560
I've never had friends over before.

406
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,520
This was my first time ever.

407
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,840
It means a lot to me.

408
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
Then,

409
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,399
can I drop by again?

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,000
I know that getting too close
to the Sun like her

411
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,879
can get me burned by the heat.

412
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,360
But if it's the only way to be near Sun,

413
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,199
just prepare to get burned, Ongsa.

414
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,560
I'll be leaving then.

415
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,520
Get home safe, Sun.

416
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,600
Thank you.

417
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,480
Sun.

418
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,520
Thank you. I forgot that.

419
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,760
Ride safe.

420
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,800
Thank you.

421
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,520
Goodnight, Sun.

422
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,520
Goodnight to you too.

423
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,520
Let's hand out these.

424
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,560
Hi. The Astronomy Club is offering
fortune-telling this year.

425
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:35,600
-We're reading fortunes for free.
-Don't forget to swing by.

426
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,720
Let's go.

427
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,000
Make sure they look great.

428
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
ASTROLOGICAL FORTUNE-TELLING:
SCHOOL, LOVE, FINANCE

429
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,720
FLORAL DESIGN CLUB: ROSES FOR YOU

430
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,879
SEND ROSES TO YOUR CRUSH.

431
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,480
WRITE THE PERSON'S NAME AND CLASS.

432
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,280
WE WILL DELIVER YOUR ROSES
TO YOUR CRUSH.

433
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,560
CHESS CLUB: TUTORING CLASSES

434
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,520
Human.

435
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,439
Let's put up the posters
on the third floor.

436
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,520
I don't think anyone will come, Aylin.

437
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,639
Maybe humans just take time
to travel here.

438
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,320
What if nobody cares about our club?

439
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,439
Please come in.

440
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
Welcome.

441
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,080
Please step inside.

442
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,919
The fortune tellers are waiting for you.

443
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
This way, please.

444
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,399
The other customer, over here.

445
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,120
I hope you two enjoy the Astronomy Club's
astrological fortune-telling.

446
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,959
Alien, you know how to tell fortunes?

447
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,320
I'm an alien fortune teller.

448
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,320
I know it.

449
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,919
I see it.

450
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,639
I feel it.

451
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,800
Whoa! You're channeling power.

452
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,760
I'm getting goosebumps.

453
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,560
Your name is Mint, isn't it?

454
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:30,439
How did you know? I didn't tell you that.

455
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,879
Do you have a psychic power?

456
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,639
Human Pop,
you're a Sagittarius, aren't you?

457
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,959
I am.

458
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,360
How did you know that, Alien?

459
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,199
You're stubborn. You hate it
when people tell you what to do.

460
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,120
You didn't want your fortune told,
but your friend dragged you here.

461
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,360
You planned to tell people not to come
if Alien wasn't accurate.

462
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,280
Is that right?

463
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,520
-How did you know?
-Of course I knew.

464
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,959
I've known you since Grade 4, human bully.

465
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,879
What did you say?

466
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,399
Are you ready to have your fortune told?

467
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,320
I am.

468
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,280
Then may I please have your date of birth?

469
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,520
Of course.

470
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,600
Did you just buy a house
in the Lak Si district?

471
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,360
How did you know that, Alien?

472
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:14,159
I only just posted it on Facebook
five minutes ago.

473
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,199
Shit. I'm getting chills.

474
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,320
You're a Gemini, air element.

475
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,800
You get along well with those
of the fire element.

476
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:24,439
That's why I became good friends with Pop.

477
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,639
And…

478
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:30,040
Fortune teller, can you tell me
anything about love?

479
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,159
Why do you look stressed?

480
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,760
Anything can happen with fortunes.

481
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,919
Well, I want to know
something about my friend.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,760
My boyfriend doesn't have time
for me these days.

483
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,639
He has cram school after school.

484
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:49,159
When we video call, instead of talking,
I have to watch him read.

485
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,879
Alien, can you tell me

486
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,879
if Mint is so infatuated with her guy
that she will neglect me?

487
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,320
I only have one close friend.

488
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,600
I think the one
who can answer this question is

489
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,040
your boyfriend.

490
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,159
Each human friend has their own life.

491
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,959
No human friend
can stay with you forever, human Pop.

492
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,639
There are days
when friends encounter each other

493
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,760
and days when friends depart.

494
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,520
If you guys truly love
and value each other,

495
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,120
you guys cannot be apart.

496
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,000
It's just like the Earth
that needs light from the Sun.

497
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,719
That's so great.

498
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,360
It's sharp and touching.

499
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,000
I'll tell lots of people to come
and have their fortune told by you, Alien.

500
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,080
Did I say something wrong?

501
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,719
I'm sorry, Mint.

502
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,280
No, no.

503
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,480
You were right about everything,
fortune teller.

504
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,600
It just hit hard.

505
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,480
I'll tell my friends to come
and use your service.

506
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,320
Thank you so much.

507
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,399
Thank you, Mint.

508
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,919
I hope you have a long relationship
with your boyfriend.

509
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:10,000
Here she comes!

510
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,080
-I want to have my fortune told.
-Can I go first?

511
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,600
Guys, calm down.

512
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,880
I'll let the two people
who came first inside.

513
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,120
-That's me.
-You two?

514
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,080
-Yes.
-Okay.

515
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,520
-Sun, take these two girls inside.
-Of course.

516
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,560
-You guys are next in line.
-We have more customers coming in.

517
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,600
Guys, who are the next two?

518
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,159
I am so stressed.

519
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
My friends labeled me a bad person

520
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,600
even though I've done nothing wrong.

521
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,120
Fortune teller Alien,
will I pass my English exam?

522
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,199
Looking good.

523
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:45,440
-Here's your cue ticket.
-Grab your ticket, guys.

524
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,400
They are so precise.

525
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,759
-So accurate.
-Really?

526
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
Please have a seat.

527
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:52,520
Aylin, hang in there.

528
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,440
Okay?

529
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,120
What do you want to know?

530
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,799
Love.

531
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,360
-Love?
-I have a crush on someone.

532
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,279
But, I'm afraid to start a conversation.

533
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,440
I don't know what the person feels.

534
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,000
Please help me, fortune teller.

535
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,759
Will my mom win the lottery this round?

536
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,920
Today is the most
Alien has ever spoken to humans.

537
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
Me too.

538
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,480
I'll be right back, human.
I'm buying some water.

539
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,279
-Where are you going?
-To get water.

540
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,319
I'm coming with you.

541
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,440
Annoying human senior.

542
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
I'm coming.

543
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,799
Can you tell my fortune as well?

544
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,120
Time's up, human senior.

545
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,440
Please, Aylin.

546
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,680
Everything went so well.

547
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:15,920
The Astronomy Club was even more popular
than Ton's Mysterious Stories Club.

548
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,839
Being the fortune teller Ongsa
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

549
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,400
At least today, you did something
you never thought you could do, Ongsa.

550
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,759
Can I still have my fortune told?

551
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,200
We're closed.

552
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,160
Can't you do one more, fortune teller?

553
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,880
Sun.

554
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:56,759
The heat from the Sun is burning me again.

555
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,640
Well then,

556
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,440
can I have your date of birth?

557
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,480
It's June 22nd.

558
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,880
"Those born on June 22nd are Geminis.

559
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,839
Their zodiac constellation
is Gemini, the twins.

560
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:35,400
Gemini folks are wise and fun,

561
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,120
with excellent leadership skills.

562
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,920
They are eloquent
and good problem solvers.

563
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,600
Mercury is their ruling planet.

564
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,040
It's the first planet in the solar system.

565
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,960
So, Gemini people are born
to be the first in everything,

566
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,600
and the first in many people's hearts."

567
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,440
What about their love?

568
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,520
Love?

569
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:23,920
Love…

570
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
I mean,

571
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,160
let's say I like someone

572
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,799
who I've never met in person before.

573
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,400
How likely is it that the person
will reciprocate my feelings?

574
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,600
My question is nonsense.

575
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,960
How can you know?

576
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:07,880
Since you can't escape orbiting this Sun,

577
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,319
you might as well be brave, Ongsa.

578
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:25,680
Very likely.

579
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,720
That person must like you very much.

580
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:41,720
Regardless, both Earth and the Sun
will inevitably coexist in this universe.

581
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,759
Where are you going, Ongsa?

582
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,200
What's the point of running away
from the Sun, Ongsa?

583
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,920
You must revolve in
the same universe as Sun anyway.

584
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:01,520
I'll be right back, Sun.

585
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,440
A universe that needs
no prophecy from the stars.

586
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
FLORAL DESIGN CLUB

587
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,640
A universe where
you already know how you feel.

588
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,960
Are these for me?

589
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,440
"TO MY SUN, FROM YOUR EARTH."

590
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,200
Earth?

591
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,120
Sun.

592
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,520
I…

593
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,480
Guys, I'm having a birthday party
this Saturday.

594
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,279
It'd be great if you guys could come.

595
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,560
Do you have time?

596
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
-I do.
-I do.

597
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,400
A meaningful present?

598
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,600
For me, spending time
with someone special is enough.

599
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,720
Do you think aliens have hearts, human?

600
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,880
Can aliens fall in love
just like humans do?

601
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,640
Can I ask you a favor, Earth?

602
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,640
Can we meet?

603
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,680
What?

604
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:13,319
I think you'd better tell her soon
that you're Earth.

605
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,120
Do you really like Sun, human?

606
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,000
If you do, you must make it right.

607
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,759
Keep lying, and you may eventually
drift away from your orbit around her.

608
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,440
If he wasn't going to come,
why didn't he say so?

609
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,440
Deep down, I still believe Earth
will come to see me.

610
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,640
I have no idea what to do about Sun.

611
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,279
If I go see her,

612
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:38,279
she'll be disappointed that I'm not a guy
like she thought I was.

613
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,720
If I don't go,

614
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:42,279
she will be sad because
Earth broke his promise.
