1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,400
Do you know when life is the hardest?

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,910
The moment you realize that being betrayed by the one whom you trusted the most,

3
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,090
is the most painful and agonizing.

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,790
Pandora's box.

5
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,120
Pandora's box exists even between a married couple.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,120
One that must never be opened.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,000
But when the lid pops off,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,590
that's when horrific hell begins.

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,770
A beautiful and fancy wedding...

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,670
Why do two people in love have a wedding for others to see

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,480
when going off together and living well should be enough?

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,610
It's the first show to show off to others.

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,720
That's the start of show window.

14
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,520
Get ready for CPR.

15
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,580

16
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,990
You're coming home early tonight, right?

17
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,720
The mustard leaf kimchi you like is ripe and tasty now.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,360
 I'll be a little late.

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,300
 A meeting was scheduled all of a sudden.

20
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,330
Really?

21
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,070
Too bad.

22
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,440
Don't work too hard.

23
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,820
Okay, see you at home.

24
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,180
 I'll be a little late. A meeting was scheduled all of a sudden.

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,440
- Yes? 
 - Why aren't you here yet?

26
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,490
I'm looking for parking.

27
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,710
Just park it at the shopping complex.

28
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,630
 Shopping complex?

29
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,570
Okay. I'll be up soon.

30
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay.

31
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,610

32
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,840
Are you home now?

33
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,450
 Hello?

34
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,670
Oh...

35
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,340
Yeah, I'm home.

36
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,070
Have you tried the mustard leaf kimchi?

37
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,030
I don't know if it's to your liking.

38
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,400
It's tasty. Make sure you give me the recipe later.

39
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,180
I'm sorry, but if it's not urgent, can I call you back?

40
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,340
By chance... is your boyfriend there with you?

41
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,460
Yes.

42
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,650
Okay.

43
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,190
Then talk to you later.

44
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,190
It's perfect.

45
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,850
Be careful. You'll get it on your shirt.

46
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,850
Where did you get it?

47
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,360
Someone I know gave it to me.

48
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Someone you know? Who?

49
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,790
Why are you getting it all over your face like a child? So messy.

50
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,440
Messy?

51
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,600
What are you doing?

52
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,980
So we can be messy together.

53
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,960
Don't do that!

54
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,100
You're like a kid sometimes!

55
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,290
 I love another woman's man.

56
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,610
 My boyfriend doesn't really like meat.

57
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,490
 He knows how to pick fruits since his parents have an orchard.

58
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,770

59
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,190

60
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,560

61
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,120
The mustard leaf kimchi...

62
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,650
Who gave it to you again?

63
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,240
Why?

64
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,860
You moved in too recently to have met someone already.

65
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,520
Also, you don't usually get close to others.

66
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,900
It turns out this girl I used to work with, lives nearby.

67
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,330
I met her by chance.

68
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,440
We were close but lost touch. She gave it to me.

69
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,230
It must have been nice to see her.

70
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,850
Still, don't be too friendly with her.

71
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,490
Okay.

72
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,440
I should go now.

73
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,760
- Already? 
 - Yeah.

74
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,620
I have some work left to do, so I need to finish it up at home.

75
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,490
Sleep well.

76
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,900
 Hi, honey, where are you?

77
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,450
Where are you right now?

78
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,750
 Home. Why?

79
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,950
You're home?

80
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,590
Mom!

81
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,590
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer our calls?

82
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,550
Where have you been? Is something wrong?

83
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,340
Honey.

84
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,120
It's late. Go to bed now.

85
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,420
Mom...

86
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,480
I'm fine, so don't worry and go to bed.

87
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,480
- Mom, exactly whatâ€“ 
 - Didn't you hear? Go to bed!

88
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,240
Yeah, listen to your mom.

89
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,320
Come on, go upstairs.

90
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,930
Go get some sleep.

91
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,320
Honey.

92
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,490
  I bought it at the flea market in front of Hongdae.

93
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,890
I thought something happened. We were all so worried.

94
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,480
Do you know this bracelet?

95
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,460
No.

96
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,920
I don't know it. Why?

97
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,900
You really don't?

98
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,360
What is this bracelet?

99
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,120
Never mind.

100
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,450
Are you sure nothing happened?

101
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,250
Did you eat dinner?

102
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,450
I did. It's late.

103
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,210
Where? Who with?

104
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,590
At the company because of the meeting.

105
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,470
What did you eat?

106
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,680
What is it all of a sudden?

107
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm asking what you ate for dinner. Why can't you answer?

108
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,300
-  Yes, sir.   
 - Secretary Kang.

109
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,520
What did we eat for dinner at the strategy meeting?

110
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,880
 Pardon?

111
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,370
 I had sandwiches and cookies prepared.

112
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,540
 Was something wrong with the food?

113
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,650
No. Good night then.

114
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,650
What is it?

115
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,830
Are you sure you're okay?

116
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,830
No. For now...

117
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,000
For now, I'm fine.

118
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,510
But...

119
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,910
I don't have conviction.

120
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,820
What do you mean by that?

121
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,210
I'm feeling a little... down today.

122
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,880
I guess my depression is back. You know I get like this once in a while.

123
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,860
If it's too hard,

124
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,790
go see a doctor.

125
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,660

126
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,750

127
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,020
Hello.

128
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,790
Please write down your concerns anonymously.

129
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay.

130
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,820
People who continue to cheat,

131
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,620
have an addiction and form bad habits.

132
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,980
There's a way to stop it at once.

133
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,760
Get a divorce. Cleanly.

134
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,600
But get a divorce after you are

135
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,870
financially independent.

136
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,840
Then, should we listen to some of the concerns of those who came today?

137
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,950
My husband is perfect. A great father and a sweet husband,

138
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,850
and a respectable businessman who's flawless.

139
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,850
But I think he has a woman.

140
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm so confused thinking about his other side I've never once considered before.

141
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,610
I feel like the family I've protected with so much effort

142
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,490
is going to crumble overnight.

143
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,480
You have two choices.

144
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,610
Don't try to find out, and trust him until the end.

145
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,060
Or look into it and uncover

146
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,720
everything, and end it once and for all. It's up to you which decision you make.

147
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,480
Your husband, children? Other people? Don't worry about them and what they think.

148
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,280
Living a life where you make yourself happy instead of others,

149
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,530
will be a life without regret. Please remember that.

150
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,350

151
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,610
How did you like the lecture?

152
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,020
I liked it.

153
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you like the solution I suggested?

154
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,660
What do you mean?

155
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,540
Why are you so surprised?

156
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,620
The solution I gave to the person whose concern I read out loud. How was it?

157
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,710
Well,

158
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,600
you told them to live a life for themselves,

159
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,710
but who doesn't know that?

160
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,040
Still, no one can live that way.

161
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,440
Why not?

162
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,810
Living for yourself...

163
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,770
It's hard to know what that is exactly.

164
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,610
I can't separate my family from my own life.

165
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,860
That's... probably every married woman's

166
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,810
common thought.

167
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,850
It's a dilemma, too.

168
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,380
Can I ask you something?

169
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,680
- Why wasn't it me? 
 - What?

170
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,620
As a potential husband, why was I dropped?

171
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,700
Out of the blue?

172
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,420
I mean, I was always curious why I didn't make it.

173
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,450
What was the reason?

174
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,500
You were too...

175
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,840
free.

176
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,460

177
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,370
 Do you know this bracelet?

178
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,420
Hello?

179
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,570
Hi. What are you doing?

180
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,510
- I was on my way to the art academy. 
 - You're teaching today?

181
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,050
Yeah. Why are you calling at this hour?

182
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,530
Well... the bracelet I gave you as a present...

183
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,600
do you still wear it these days?

184
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,300
Of course. I wear it every day since I love it so much.

185
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,680
I'm wearing it now, too.

186
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,020
You're wearing it now, too?

187
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,770
Yeah.

188
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,740
Why? You want a photo of it?

189
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,520
No. Never mind.

190
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,710
Okay then. Enjoy your teaching.

191
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,970
Yes?

192
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,090
Oh, Jeong Won!

193
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,680
Welcome.

194
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,320
Thanks to you, I came back safely after finishing my studies.

195
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,560
Thank you.

196
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,930
You asked him to return?

197
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,450
Yes.

198
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,560
You must have offered him a position.

199
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,140
Something like Team Leader of the Design Team?

200
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,830
Yes.

201
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,040
I... know that I'm lacking.

202
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,560
I'll politely decline his offer.

203
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,390
What arrogance!

204
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,870
Do you know how much I spent on you? How dare you freely decline the offer?!

205
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:21,080
Come and work. All the money that went into you, pay it back by working here.

206
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,480
You can leave now.

207
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,330
Executive Director Shin, you can stay.

208
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,210
Yes.

209
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,120
Is the Shanghai department store issue still not resolved yet?

210
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,970
It should be resolved soon.

211
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,220
Soon, soon, soon!

212
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,070
If you're not confident, quit your job.

213
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,110
I won't go easy on you just because you're my son-in-law. If you can't do your job,

214
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,840
I don't need you.

215
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,580
There are plenty of people who I can replace you with.

216
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,780
I'll get it done within a month.

217
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,570
If I can't get it done in that time, I'll leave willingly.

218
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,970
Just one month.

219
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,430
Yes, Ma'am.

220
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,310
 If you resolve the issue,

221
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,490
 I'll promote you as the group's

222
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,300
 president.

223
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,130
Yes?

224
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,320
What's gotten into you? You never come out when I ask you to.

225
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,300
Asking for a date first.

226
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:16,410
I love steak, but I've been eating to suit your taste,

227
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,620
so I forgot that I liked meat.

228
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,310
Really?

229
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,600
I feel so bad.

230
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,910
I'm going to eat what I want,

231
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,280
and wear what I want from now on.

232
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,220
Okay. You've been too dedicated to our kids and me.

233
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,260
Do everything you want, too, from now on.

234
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,900
What about you?

235
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,420
Huh?

236
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,370
Are you doing whatever you want with your life?

237
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,480
Well, kind of.

238
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,630
By chance...

239
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,880
is there anything you're keeping from me?

240
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,360
Keeping from you?

241
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,170
I was curious. I feel like I knew all there was to know about you,

242
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,550
but sometimes I wonder if I'm being delusional.

243
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:25,020
Do you... have any secrets

244
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,680
that I don't know about?

245
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,990
I do.

246
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,480
A secret I'm hiding from you.

247
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,650
And what is that?

248
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,270
My heart.

249
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,990
How much I love you.

250
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,200
All these years, what I've shown you

251
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,510
has only been a hundredth

252
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,090
no, a thousandth of how I feel about you.

253
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,960
Hold on a second.

254
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,930
Yes? Did you look into it?

255
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,810
Okay. Set up an emergency meeting.

256
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,190
Okay.

257
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,740
There's something urgent, so I need to go.

258
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,070
I feel bad for ruining our first date in a long time.

259
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,000
It's okay. Go ahead.

260
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,990
Then eat slowly and get home safely.

261
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,570
Sorry.

262
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,740
I have something to ask.

263
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,360
Is anything possible no matter what the condition?

264
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,910
Seon Joo, what brings you by so early?

265
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,270
Let me come in for a second.

266
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,190
Is something wrong?

267
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,130
Seon Joo.

268
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,570
Can you get me some coffee?

269
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,940
Okay.

270
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,520
Can I use your powder room?

271
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,140
Of course.

272
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,240
I came out in a hurry, so I didn't even put on any makeup.

273
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,750
Of course. Use it freely.

274
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,790

275
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Have you had breakfast?

276
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,680
If you haven't, let's have some brunch together.

277
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,200
The cafÃ© out front has pretty good brunch.

278
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,860
I'll get you more coffee.

279
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,870
What's his name?

280
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,800
What is it?

281
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
His name.

282
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,370
Your man.

283
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,380
Joon Ho.

284
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,360
His name is Kim Joon Ho.

285
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,250
But why do you ask?

286
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,300
The man you love is called

287
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,500
Kim Joon Ho?

288
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,150
What are you doing here, Joon Ho?

289
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,570
I left something behind.

290
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,850
I told you before.

291
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,720
She's my friend. This is Kim Joon Ho.

292
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Hello.

293
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,530
I'm sorry for barging in so early in the morning.

294
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,520
I'll get going.

295
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,610
Great job.

296
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,640
Thank you.

297
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,210
When you need me again, just send me a text.

298
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,840
Not yet.

299
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,810
It's not time yet...

300
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,020
Good morning, Seon Joo!

301
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,940
Good morning.

302
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,850
Excuse me.

303
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,720
Last time,

304
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,260
why did you ask me what's going on

305
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,780
with my husband?

306
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,010
What?!

307
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,300
I did?

308
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,190
Oh, I guess I was just saying hello.

309
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,370
But why do you ask?

310
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,340
It's nothing.

311
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,420
Go ahead and exercise.

312
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,030
Bye!

313
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,410
Did I light the fuse for no reason?

314
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,490

315
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't see Seon Joo.

316
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,910
They were stuck together, but she's alone.

317
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,480
Maybe they had a fight.

318
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,430
I knew it wouldn't last.

319
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,520
How can the queen and a mistress get along?

320
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,960
Let's go use the sauna.

321
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,260

322
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,190
Why would you wear a ring into the sauna?

323
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,180
What is this ring that you're wearing it everyday?!

324
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,270
It's not even that pretty.

325
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,450
It's a Moobulhwae ring.

326
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,960
Moo what?

327
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,630
It's a ring for the private group formed of just the top 1% of my chief prosecutor's training center colleagues.

328
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,720
Moobulhwae.

329
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,150
You could say it's a meeting of the future power that will lead the judicial world of Korea.

330
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:07,550
What if I get scratched by that ring?

331
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,810
Take it off now!

332
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,980
Fine.

333
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,360

334
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,300
My ring! My ring!

335
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,380
Go!

336
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,080
Han Seon Joo, have you only been shooting all this time?

337
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,830
It's my first time in three years.

338
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,790
How are you this good then?

339
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,100
I don't know. Maybe because I'm in a good mood?

340
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,790
Something good happen?

341
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,080
Well, not something good.

342
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,960
More like something that's been gnawing at me disappeared in one moment.

343
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,880
Go!

344
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,940
Are you crazy?

345
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,310
Why would you go to the sauna wearing that precious ring?!

346
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,910
I- I'm sorry.

347
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,310
Don't you know you need the ring for entrance?

348
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,860
Were you feeling full of yourself wearing something that surpasses your worth?

349
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,690
I'll make sure to get the ring back.

350
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,850
Whatever it takes, I'll get it back.

351
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,400
What a ball and chain. Don't follow me.

352
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,170
It's not even a brand name item.

353
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,240
Why is he raising a fuss in the middle of the night?

354
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,670
What do you mean?! You can't buy that ring anywhere!

355
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,970
Let's calm down.

356
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,420
My husband is looking into it right now.

357
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,820
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Joon Sang of JS Jewelry.

358
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,710
I'm sorry to call so late.

359
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:09,100
Sir, do you know of a ring called Moobulhwae that was made by your company?

360
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,550
Is there anyway to get another one? The owner lost it.

361
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:15,190
She wants to get a replacement.

362
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,650
You have a sample?

363
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,400
They have it. You're fine now.

364
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,250
Good morning.

365
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,800
The light was on until 1AM this morning. You're already up?

366
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,710
Mom. I want to get the shot for controlling my menstruation cycle.

367
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,000
I told you you can't. No more about that.

368
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,350
If I get bad scores because I feel horrible from PMS, it only hurts me.

369
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:56,050
I love you, Tae Hee. You're doing well now.

370
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:01,200
I just want you to live naturally like you have been.

371
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,310
Are you sure you're the mother of a high school senior?

372
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,180
Wash up and come down. You have to eat before you to go school.

373
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,010
My son. Did you sleep well?

374
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,150
Mom.

375
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,330
I love your smell.

376
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,020
You're like a junior high baby.

377
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,910
What brings you here without calling?

378
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,870
To apologize.

379
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,560
I misunderstood you a little.

380
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,950
What do you mean?

381
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,270
Here. It's my apology.

382
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,660
Come in. Let's have some tea.

383
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,410
I have an appointment I need to go to, so let's have coffee next time.

384
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,530
Okay. Thank you for this.

385
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,550
I'll see you.

386
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,910
Han Seon Joo...

387
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:50,470
it would have been so great if you weren't such a nice person.

388
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:16,560
Did I eat something wrong?

389
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,250
You don't like getting together for drinks like this. What's going on?

390
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,140
More.

391
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,000
You know that a lot of

392
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,030
Korean brands were rejected from entering the Shanghai department store, right?

393
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:35,340
Our company got turned down while in the process of entering.

394
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,370
So? What is it that you want?

395
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:49,020
I wanted to ask you to reconsider letting our brand get into the store.

396
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,020
I came to see you ask for your help, Chairman Oh.

397
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,800
Listen here, Executive Director Shin.

398
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,840
I am a businessman,

399
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,600
and I need to gain something from it.

400
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,920
Right now, there's nothing I can do for you that would be beneficial,

401
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,310
but later, I'll be sure to pay you back.

402
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:20,240
Suddenly, I don't feel like drinking anymore.

403
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,060
Please...

404
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,560
please help me, sir.

405
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,530
 Sorry for coming to see you out of the blue, Chairman Oh.

406
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,560
 I'm your father's friend, not chairman.

407
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,330
 I'm like your father.

408
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,700
 To be honest, I had a favor to ask.

409
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,170
 Favor? What is it?

410
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,390
This is why I like you.

411
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,610
Here. Drink up.

412
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,430
It's to celebrate becoming my family.

413
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,340
Yes, sir.

414
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,610
Thank you, Driver Yeon.

415
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:28,920
Of course. Then rest well.

416
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,800
- Good-bye. 
 - Good-bye.

417
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,340
Chairman Oh, thank you!

418
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,380
Yes. I'll take good care of him.

419
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,270
Okay. Have a good rest then.

420
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,430
It's popular these days.

421
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,460
A lot of people look for it.

422
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,140
- Can I try some? 
 - Of course.

423
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,300
It's nice to use it while carrying it around with you.

424
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,020
It's moisturizing.

425
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,090
Please give me these and wrap them up.

426
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,520
Okay.

427
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,140
Pick out something else.

428
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,260
Mi Ra!

429
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,260
Oh, Seon Joo!

430
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,500
Did you come to buy something?

431
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,600
Yes. This and that.

432
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,850
Oh right. Say hello to my kids.

433
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,740
I told you about her. She's a close friend of mine.

434
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,340
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

435
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,620
Hi, nice to meet you.

436
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,030
Oh right!  Have you had dinner?

437
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,770
Let's eat together after I drop them off at the academy.

438
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,280
Do you want to come over to my house?

439
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,580
Your house?

440
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,210
Those shoes mean a lot to me.

441
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,910
Those, my father made for me;

442
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:56,060
and these, my husband made them for me as a present when he proposed.

443
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:27,570
It's really a beautiful home.

444
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,900
Like you, there's a lot of warmth and comfort throughout.

445
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:43,620
Will I... be able to have a family like you?

446
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,620
Of course.

447
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:55,310
You can have

448
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,120
a beautiful family of your own, too.

449
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,660
Right?

450
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:05,650
I, too... will be able to have one. Right?

451
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:07,700
Someday?

452
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,400
Of course.

453
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,570
I don't know if it suits your taste.

454
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,640
How much do you love your husband?

455
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,360
Huh?

456
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,290
Your husband, how much do you love him?

457
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:41,810
Do you love him passionately that you can't live without him still?

458
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,940
Well...

459
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:50,360
Then you don't love him anymore?

460
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,770
I do love him.

461
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:59,340
But it's a different shade of love, you could say.

462
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,820
I think being a husband and wife surpasses the relationship between a man and a woman.

463
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:09,000
Surpasses the relationship between a man and a woman?

464
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,270
At first, I married him because I loved him passionately, of course.

465
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,970
With the feeling that I'd die without him.

466
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:20,720
But after time passes, all that passion does dissipate.

467
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,150
If I loved him passionately to death every day, it would be too hard to live.

468
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,560
Spending lots of time together,

469
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,540
we were able to share happy and difficult memories together.

470
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,960
And while becoming parents to our beautiful children,

471
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,840
I think a husband and wife end up as a unit sharing a common destiny.

472
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:50,140
We're family. A family that shares a profound relationship.

473
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,070
I'm envious.

474
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,460
I want to end up like you.

475
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,060
Sharing many memories together with the one you love,

476
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:09,510
and becoming parents to beautiful children as a family-like couple.

477
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,670
Hello?

478
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,720
It's me.

479
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,500
How did you get my number?

480
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,960
Watch how you speak to me!

481
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,490
I have nothing to say to you, so stop calling me.

482
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,890
 I heard that Executive Director Shin is being sworn in as the president.

483
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,840
So?

484
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:00,150
Since you won't listen to me, I thought I should go to the celebration.

485
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:03,800
To congratulate him and ask him for a favor.

486
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,230
You messed up my life plenty already!

487
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:14,080
So please let me go, Uncle!

488
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,780
I'll see you there.

489
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,850

490
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,810
 The phone is turned off, so you'll be...

491
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,950
Why make such a fuss?

492
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,170
I'm not happy about it.

493
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,910
He's dedicated nearly 20 years to the company.

494
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:57,810
He has the right to be congratulated this way.

495
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:03,980
I gave him the position, but I don't feel settled.

496
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,360
He'll do a good job.

497
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,380
You know that he's more capable than anyone else.

498
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,740
He's not just an executive director anymore,

499
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:15,640
but holds one of the top positions at LaReine group now.

500
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,920
Tae Hee and Tae Yong, do you want to go get some dessert with me?

501
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,360
Okay, Uncle.

502
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,710
- Let's go. 
 - Let's.

503
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,540
Mom, please. Not today, please.

504
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:54,010
After whipping him all this time, I tried giving him a carrot and he took it in an instant.

505
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,240
I didn't think he would get it resolved so quickly.

506
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,440
Did you help him again?

507
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,670
As you've always done?

508
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:05,000
I didn't do such a thing.

509
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,590
Tae Hee's dad is more dedicated to his own desires

510
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,430
than to moral beliefs.

511
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:29,050
Those kinds of people end up showing their true selves one day.

512
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,590
That again...

513
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,220
I'll tell you again,

514
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:38,160
but don't trust your husband too much.

515
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:32,400

516
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,810
Why are you here? Are you crazy?

517
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:45,400
My uncle... he said he was coming here.

518
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,890
I called you but you didn't pick up.

519
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:52,980
I thought I needed to stop him from doing something to put you in a bad position. What should I do?

520
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,230
Is he still following you around and bothering you?

521
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,940
You should have told me.

522
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,520
Instead of worrying all by yourself.

523
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,400
 I didn't want to be a hindrance to you. Sorry.

524
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,760
I'll take care of it. Everything.

525
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,520
I will.

526
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,770
Don't worry.

527
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:49,010

528
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:55,340
â™«  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  â™«

529
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:59,860
â™«  If there is, knock. Hello  â™«

530
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:04,180
â™«  If you are still there  â™«

531
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:10,660
â™«  To me, if you feel like that  â™«

532
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:16,230
â™«  If there is anything left to tell, to me  â™«

533
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:19,580
â™«  Anything is fine  â™«

534
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,860
â™«  The bright lights of this city  â™«

535
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:27,480
â™«  My footsteps have been erased  â™«

536
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,740

â™«  I can not hear you  â™«

537
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,350
 You've now achieved everything.

538
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,390
 I have to become the chairman.

539
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,360
 Being second-in-command isn't my thing.

540
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,870
 How could you betray me?

541
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:47,520
 Cheating is only a momentary thing. It passes by and means nothing.

542
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,840
 We don't have a special relationship.

543
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,680
 From now on, I'll listen to everything you say.

544
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,940
 If you tell me not to, I won't do it. I promise.

545
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,940
 I think you started this whole situation. I blame you.

546
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,930
 He told me that when he's with me, he can finally breathe.

547
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:07,720
 Stop playing around already.

548
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,210
 Like you said, I'm planning to have Shin Myeong Seop.

549
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:13,180
 Die.

550
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,160
 Die! Die!

551
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,250
 Die!

552
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,380
â™«  Sorry I canâ€™t hear you well  â™«

553
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,490
â™«  Don't fall apart yet, I'm... Hello  â™«
