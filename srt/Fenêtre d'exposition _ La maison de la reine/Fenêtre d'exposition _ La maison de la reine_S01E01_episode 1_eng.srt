1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,970

2
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,420

(T/N: Vow Renewal)

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,700
I, Shin Myeong Seop,

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,400
vow to love and respect my one and only wife, Han Seon Joo, forever.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,640
I, Han Seon Joo, vow to

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,500
love and respect my one and only husband, Shin Myeong Seop, forever.

8
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,330
- Where's Mom? 
 - What?

9
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,840
She was just here.

10
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,870
Oh my god! What's that sound?

11
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,290
They were like the dream couple of the townhouse community.

12
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,450
How on earth did such a horrible thing happen?

13
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,150
I really can't believe this.

14
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,570
How do I put this?

15
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,680
I felt something was off from the start.

16
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,000
I had a feeling that someday a big accident would happen.

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,300
Everyone has a secret or two that they want to hide.

18
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,110
Especially when it comes to a married couple.

19
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,770
There might be some secrets you do not want to face.

20
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,090
Detective, I've seen all types of crimes of passion.

21
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,390
But I really don't understand this case.

22
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,540
Are you married?

23
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,270
No, I am still single.

24
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,430
A marriage is actually

25
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,260
misunderstandings and distrust rather than understanding.

26
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,660
A battlefield...

27
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,650

28
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,780

29
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,980
What are you debating about?

30
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,070
This will be nice.

31
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,410
It is a place where all the Korean celebrities will gather.

32
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,580
You should stand out the most.

33
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,620
Skills,

34
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,410
manners, and charisma.

35
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,020
You are a man who owns everything in this world.

36
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,360
The best out of everything that I have is...

37
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
you.

38
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,930
It's been a while since you took a break.

39
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,990
You should come along with me.

40
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,360
I want to go too, but the kids' midterms are coming up.

41
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,940
I need to take care of them.

42
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,820
Okay. You should get going.

43
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,630
Okay.

44
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,400
Oh.

45
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,050
Give me a call once you arrive.

46
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,930
I'll be back then.

47
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,470
Go inside.

48
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,910

49
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,080
- Can't I take this? 
 - Sure.

50
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,920
This is very pretty!

51
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,200
You may take it.

52
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,120
Thank you!

53
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,530
Okay.

54
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,240
Please wear it prettily.

55
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,370
Ye Rang.

56
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,040
The bazaar started ages ago! Why are you so late?

57
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,650
Did you buy Seon Joo's donated item?

58
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,010
You picked mine, right?

59
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,920
But Seon Joo has the best items here.

60
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,190
Everything was sold even before I could pick anything.

61
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,600
You should have bought whatever and gotten in her favor!

62
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,650
I was too late.

63
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,130
- Where is she? Where? 
 - Over there.

64
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,270
Thank you. Take care.

65
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,550
- Why did you come in here? 
 - Why?

66
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,200
It's thrilling and fun!

67
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,340
What if someone sees?

68
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,840
Then it's even more thrilling.

69
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,570

70
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,100
 As you already know,

71
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,820
but I detest gambling and any kind of adventure.

72
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,640
If the upcoming launching show fails,

73
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,420
you have to take complete responsibility.

74
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,710
Have I ever failed, Chairwoman?

75
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,980
Why did Seon Joo not come along with you?

76
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,330
She could have gotten some relaxation. I told you to bring her along.

77
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,020
You know that she's not

78
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,500
interested in working for the company.

79
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,850
I'm sure she's just pretending not to be.

80
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,990
You may leave now.

81
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,750
Yes, Ma'am.

82
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,290
Who's the designer that was brought in from the outside?

83
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,210
One of the employees from the subcontractor company LaReine dealt with it.

84
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,650
How is the designer related to Shin Myeong Seop?

85
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,240
We found no special connection.

86
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,220
You both go inside first.

87
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,820
Hye Rim's mother.

88
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,080
Are you coming back from somewhere?

89
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,950
Yes, I had something come up.

90
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,300
Who's picking up Hye Rim?

91
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,240
She'll take a cab.

92
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,390
You should have asked me if you're busy. It's a dangerous world.

93
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,050
Did you drink?

94
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,000
Am I still not sober

95
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
from drinking yesterday...?

96
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,330
Hye Rim's mother, what is the matter these days?

97
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,210
Where's your mind these days?

98
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,000
Where's my mind these days?

99
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,080
Not sure. I wonder.

100
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,210
Check.

101
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,920
Checkmate.

102
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,560
I lost again. I can never win against you, Mom.

103
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,900
Don't give up.

104
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,290
I'm jealous of Dad.

105
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,830
I wish I could have gone with him.

106
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,330
Think about your score in the last mock test.

107
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,330
Do you still want to go and have fun?

108
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,280
Hey, when I was in your grade...

109
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,800
Yes, Mom.

110
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,290
Didn't I tell you to come with your husband?

111
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,390
It's okay.

112
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,920
What do you mean?

113
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,430
Tell Miss Kim to look after the kids and come here right away.

114
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,330
I need to pick up the kids. I can't.

115
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,460
You can have Driver Yang pick them up, and there's also the scheduling teacher from the academy.

116
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,650
What's wrong with you, Mom?

117
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,510
You haven't watched the fashion show

118
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,700
or relaxed in a while. Come down.

119
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,250
I know why you're doing this,

120
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,430
but I'm not working for the company. Don't get your hopes up.

121
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,610
Just because you give your everything to

122
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,660
look after your kids and husband,

123
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,300
do you think they'll appreciate that?

124
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,240
They'll think that they ended up successful because they're so great.

125
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,890
I'm not a stay-at-home mom because I want appreciation. I'm doing it because I like it.

126
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,660
It is my choice, to live here at home.

127
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,460
The reason I asked you to come here

128
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,770
is not only because of that.

129
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,570
What do you mean?

130
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,220
In any case, stop the nonsense and come down here.

131
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,360

132
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,190
What do you think?

133
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,570
Should we play once more?

134
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,120
Yes, let's play one more game

135
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,620
Okay.

136
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,190
It feels like a dream.

137
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,980
It's not a dream.

138
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,890
What should I do?

139
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,560
I keep wanting to break our promise.

140
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,550
Keeping you for myself

141
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,960
isn't fair to you.

142
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,080
So you're saying you're breaking up with me for my sake.

143
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,500
Our breakup was planned anyway.

144
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,100
Should I just make our relationship public?

145
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,320
Instead of breaking up?

146
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,460
I was just kidding. Why are you becoming so serious?

147
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,030
We started dating in the first place after making the agreement.

148
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,440
 For me,

149
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,740
 my family is important.

150
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,580
 I know that.

151
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,520
 You already told me that.

152
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,120
 There is nothing that

153
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,960
 I can do for you.

154
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,210
 There is something you can do for me.

155
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,200
 Let's date for exactly one year.

156
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,690
 Let us date.

157
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,820
 After one year, I won't hold you back.

158
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,350
You should never abandon your family.

159
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,420
Together with your family,

160
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,750
make sure to live hundreds and thousands of years happily. Got it?

161
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,000
When it's been so difficult for me to let you go...

162
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,980
if you don't end up being happy, it'll make me miserable.

163
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,170
You're cool, my Mi Ra.

164
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,700
What's this? You seem disappointed.

165
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,440
Should I hold on to you more?

166
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,600
Let's toast.

167
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,650
For our beautiful breakup trip.

168
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,890
For our...

169
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,960
memories.

170
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,820
Tomorrow is the brand launching show. Expect to

171
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,530
see a gift I have prepared for you.

172
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,630

173
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,610
 To celebrate our fortieth anniversary,

174
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,390
 we invite you to the launch of a new brand ambitiously prepared by LaReine.

175
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,920
 Introducing... Victoria.

176
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,860

177
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,440
 Are you having a hard time these days?

178
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,480
 Do I look like that?

179
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,460
 Yes, I can tell easily when something's going on with you.

180
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,300
 Poor you.

181
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,520
 What can I do for you?

182
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,150
 You just...

183
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,370
 need to have fun with me.

184
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,240
 Come on!

185
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,870
 Wait.

186
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,460
 What is this?

187
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,860
 I was bored so I sketched it.

188
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,770
 Looks good though.

189
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,960
 I'll give it to you.

190
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,780
 If you had been more critical,

191
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,720
 the group's image and worth

192
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,770
 would have been so much better!

193
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,710
 Because of your stubbornness,

194
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,440
 do you know how much we've lost?

195
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,640
 I'll make sure

196
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,720
 to find a breakthrough design.

197
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,900
 You are having a tough time, right?

198
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,980
 I am still far from finished.

199
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,950
 You should go to sleep first.

200
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,590
 This design is very nice.

201
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,160
 I like it. Seems to know how women feel.

202
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,220
 Honey, like these heels

203
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,810
 using very feminine, classic, and luxury items.

204
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,240
 What do you think about launching a new brand?

205
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,460
 The perfection of the beauty, LaReine.

206
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,150
 You are my queen.

207
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,020
 You are my lover.

208
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,970
How was it?

209
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,840
My gift for you?

210
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,660
It was touching.

211
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,340
There will be design royalties deposited into your account

212
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,240
to match the sales of the shoes.

213
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,050
Really?

214
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,400
I've hit the jackpot.

215
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,900
Can I give you a thank-you kiss?

216
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,090
Do you know how cute you are

217
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,450
whenever you get flustered?

218
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,660
I'll go back first then.

219
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,170
All right.

220
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,120
Thank you.

221
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,890
For making my shoes into the queen's heels.

222
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,170
You know that you are always a queen to me.

223
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,810
How are you here?

224
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,810
Surprise!

225
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,920
You said you couldn't come!

226
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
You were surprised, right?

227
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,400
- When did you come? 
 - Right before the launching show.

228
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,320
How did you like the show?

229
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,420
It was amazing.

230
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,600
As expected, my husband is the best.

231
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,410
It is your idea, though.

232
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,890
Anybody can give ideas,

233
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,860
but making a rough stone

234
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,630
into a beautiful diamond is harder.

235
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,050
You are really amazing.

236
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,120
- However, who is it? 
 - What?

237
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,790
Victoria shoes' designer.

238
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,010
Are they our company's employee?

239
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,720
Web designer.

240
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,180
I want to meet the designer.

241
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,890
Is there really a need to meet?

242
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,470
What I mean is, if you are not going to join the company again,

243
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,320
it will look like you are interested in the work.

244
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,430
Mother-in-Law also has regrets about you.

245
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,780
There is no need to give her unnecessary expectations.

246
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,800
Yes, that's also true.

247
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,490
Seon Joo,

248
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,410
it's been a long time.

249
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,010
Louis.

250
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,090
Nice to meet you! How have you been?

251
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,610
Mr. Shin, today's show was absolutely impressive.

252
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,460
Above all, the Victoria shoes, jewelry...

253
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,830
I could sense the true grandeur of the queen.

254
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,160
Thank you, Mr. Louis.

255
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,660
 Myeong Seop, this is truly a spectacular show.

256
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,760
 I dare say it's by far the best season in L:aReine's history.

257
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,140
 You are the best designer shoe. How was the show?

258
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,190
 It was amazing. Those shoes were an absolute showstopper.

259
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,030
- Mom. 
 - Oh!

260
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,390
You came.

261
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,260
Congratulations.

262
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,810
Today's launching show was a grand success.

263
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,030
Chief, you also worked hard.

264
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,450
As expected, your business mind

265
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,800
has not rusted yet.

266
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,590
I didn't do much.

267
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,290
Then, please continue your conversation.

268
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,250
There is no need to be humble.

269
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,680
Everybody knows that it's your work in today's show.

270
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,380
Today, just enjoy and congratulate.

271
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,800
It is a nice occasion.

272
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,410
Great job.

273
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,730
Seeing you in a place other than home,

274
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,740
it feels so different.

275
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,200
It feels like we are dating again.

276
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,850
Don't you think so, Shin Myeong Seop?

277
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,160
You must be very tired. Do you want a bath?

278
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,140
You want me to prepare the bath?

279
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,520
No, I will take a simple shower.

280
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,290
Then, do you want a glass of wine?

281
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,770
Probably not.

282
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,450
Sure?

283
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,690
Honey, is something wrong?

284
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,990
Me? No. Why?

285
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,640
Just...

286
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,640
You are so busy, did I disturb you by coming?

287
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,160
Well...

288
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,500
The buyer from Shanghai

289
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,240
has to leave early in the morning.

290
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,440
He wants to meet right away.

291
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,560
Then, go ahead. Don't worry about me.

292
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,070
Will you be all right alone?

293
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,560
I am all right,

294
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,930
so finish all your work slowly.

295
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,330
Okay, then I'll be back soon.

296
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,170
Get some rest.

297
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,560
What is all this?

298
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,980
My gift to thank you for your gift to me.

299
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,830
Did you like my gift?

300
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,590
Yes, it was beyond my imagination. I think it turned out to be better than my design.

301
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,520
Victoria. Give it to me.

302
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,520
That's not possible.

303
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,010
Okay.

304
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,900
You're talented.

305
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,360
Don't waste that talent.

306
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,280
As expected,

307
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,480
you are the only one that recognizes me and lets me shine.

308
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,580
I love you.

309
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,230
This place is still the same.

310
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,690
Do you remember? When we came together for a trip?

311
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,900
Of course.

312
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,420
It was my first trip with you.

313
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,210
Kids would love to ride that.

314
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,740
We should bring them here next time.

315
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,790
Okay.

316
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,900
Then let's eat.

317
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,370
It tastes good.

318
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,730
Here, you try it too.

319
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,620
I am all right, I am not hungry.

320
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,570
Why?

321
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:10,770
I want to eat outside with you, not hiding in a place like this.

322
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,130
After tomorrow,

323
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,200
we will become strangers.

324
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,790
Even if we meet coincidentally, we will pretend to not know each other.

325
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,920

326
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,050
Oh... My meeting just ended.

327
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,890
I'll be right there.

328
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,460
Okay.

329
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,390
I think I need to go.

330
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,420
Go ahead.

331
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,290
Continue eating then.

332
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,930
Honey.

333
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,360
What should we do today? Where should we go?

334
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,430
Sorry. Today at the hotel's conference room,

335
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,870
the buyer meeting has officially started.

336
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,060
I might not be able to give you time.

337
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,130
That's all right.

338
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,450
It's my fault to have followed a busy person.

339
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,730
Don't worry about me and do your work.

340
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,330
I'm fine having fun on my own, too.

341
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,710
I am sorry, Honey.

342
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,880
Work hard.

343
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,730
I'll be back.

344
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,610

345
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,090
 The reason I asked you to come here...

346
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,360
 is not only because of that.

347
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,740
 Stop the nonsense and just come.

348
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,470
Here you go.

349
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,470
Thank you!

350
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:01,460
♫  It's been a long day without you  ♫

351
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,870
♫  I want you to be on my side  ♫

352
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,350
♫  When I'm alone, I miss you  ♫

353
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:14,990
♫  More and more, and more  ♫

354
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,260
♫  You make me feel like I have it all  ♫

355
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,900
♫  And I feel like I am the one again  ♫

356
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,330
♫  Nobody loved me like you did  ♫

357
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,700
♫  So, why don't you tell me you'll stay with me?  ♫

358
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,500

♫  I'm falling in, falling in love with you  ♫

360
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,790
Should I take your picture?

361
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,640
It looks like you are here alone.

362
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,260
How about we take each other's photos?

363
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,980
Should we do that?

364
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,340
♫  Can I keep on falling in love?  ♫

365
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,110
One, two...

366
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,490
I'll take a photo for you, too.

367
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,630
Thank you.

368
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,400
♫  I'm falling in, falling in love with you  ♫

369
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:23,180
One, two, three. Here you go.

370
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,770
♫  With you  ♫

371
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,730
♫  Can I keep on falling in love?  ♫

♫  I'm just falling, fallin down  ♫

374
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,400
♫  I'm just falling, fallin down  ♫

375
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,940
♫  And I'm falling, I'm just falling  ♫

376
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:48,450

00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,380
♫  And I keep on falling in love  ♫

378
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,850
It's you again.

379
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,120
Do you know that?

380
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,240
There is a legend about this island.

381
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,510
A fairy who came down from Heaven for fun

382
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,610
fell in love with a human and lived here in hiding.

383
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,180
When the Jade Emperor found out,

384
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,370
he locked up the fairy on that side,

385
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,520
and the human on that side.

386
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,020
So that they can't meet again.

387
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,500
And only look at each other.

388
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,780
It's similar to The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

389
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,990
All legends are somewhat similar.

390
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,580
It's a cliché love story.

391
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,040
Is there such a thing?

392
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,310
To each person, love is special and precious.

393
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,850
That's true.

394
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,060
To each person, love is...

395
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,500
special and precious.

396
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,690
Honey.

397
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,220
Now? I am at an amazing place.

398
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,410
Even though I'm a little sad that

399
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,610
you're not here.

400
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,620
I'm having a good time, so don't worry and go back to work.

401
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,290
Okay.

402
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,870
I love you.

403
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,720

404
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:17,120
 Come to this address I'm sending you.

405
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,080

406
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,590

407
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,470
Honestly, I don't know what this big deal with K-pop is.

408
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,420
I mean... I listen to that so I can make...

409
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,390
What's wrong?

410
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,680
Oh! We ran into each other again!

411
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,570
Did your car break down?

412
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,260
No, just out of gas.

413
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,830
- I should have checked. 
 - Have you called the car rental agency?

414
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,830
Yes, they said they'll be here soon.

415
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,820
I listen to that music so I can connect with my kids.

416
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,060
And then every time I look up the name of the songs online...

417
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,730
I'm Han Seon Joo,

418
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,870
and I'm from Seoul.

419
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,230
I'm Yoon Mi Ra, also from Seoul.

420
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,850
Don't you have to be somewhere?

421
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,470
I don't want to keep you.

422
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,780
I do need to be somewhere,

423
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,610
but not for a little while, so it's all right.

424
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,990
Hello?

425
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,520
You said you would be here soon.

426
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,270
Then, you can't come?

427
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,210
What am I supposed to do?

428
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,760
They can't come?

429
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,840
No, they had an accident on the way here.

430
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,760
They're sending me a taxi and told me to wait.

431
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,730
Are you going to town, by any chance?

432
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,190
Yes, my hotel is there.

433
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,180
Then I can give you a ride. I'm going that way, too.

434
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,110
Could you do that for me?

435
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,200
Oh, just a second.

436
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,480
Hello?

437
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,490
No, I'll get back on my own.

438
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,230
I can just leave the car here, right?

439
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,150
Okay. All right.

440
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,590
Please get in.

441
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,850
Thank you so much.

442
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,570
 The call cannot be connected, so you will be...

443
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,460
Is he busy?

444
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,540
I tagged along on my husband's business trip.

445
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,180
He's busy because of meetings, so I was going around alone.

446
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,790
I see.

447
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,130
- Are you here alone? 
  - I also came with my husba...

448
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,620
I came with my boyfriend.

449
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,170
My boyfriend is busy, too, because of work.

450
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,680
We're in the same boat.

451
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,380
Thank you so much for today.

452
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,410
I didn't do much.

453
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,270
No. I'm a total stranger,

454
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,580
but you stayed with me out of worry and even gave me a ride.

455
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,290
It may seem like nothing, but not everyone can do it.

456
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,790
Please stop, you are embarrassing me.

457
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,250
- Do you want to have dinner together? I'll treat you. 
 - No, that's okay.

458
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,630
I'm hungry, that's why.

459
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,930
Oh, right.

460
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,950
You said you needed to be somewhere.

461
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,310
I think I might have to eat dinner alone, though.

462
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:02,420
Really? Then let's eat together.

463
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,950
Sounds good.

464
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,220
Isn't this too much food for two people?

465
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,870
I'm so drained today because of everything that happened.

466
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,740
I need to recharge.

467
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,900
Okay.

468
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,540
We should eat it all, without leaving anything.

469
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,180
It's delicious.

470
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,330
Excuse me... What's the matter?

471
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,480
I think I left behind my wallet in the rental car.

472
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,640
What do I do?

473
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,390
How much is it?

474
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,980
Could you at least give me your contact info?

475
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,510
I'll pay you back.

476
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,020
No, that's not needed. Don't worry.

477
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,710
I can't do that. It's because I feel uncomfortable.

478
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:26,700
That's okay. I made good memories because of a travel mate. So it's all okay.

479
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,540
Thank you. I will cherish this for the rest of my life.

480
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,770
Yes, make sure to remember me.

481
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,690
Have a good rest of the time on this trip.

482
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,460
You too, Han Seon Joo.

483
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,200
 Honey, I am sorry I couldn't be with you....

484
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,380
 Instead, I selected a champagne that you might like.

485
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,920
 Enjoy yourself even though you're alone.

486
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,680

487
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,170
Here.

488
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,980
Open it.

489
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:20,630
I chose shoes that suit you.

490
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,290
They are sexy.

491
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,090
Give it to me.

492
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,130
High heels are like combat boots for women.

493
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,400
From now on,

494
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,420
no matter what hardship comes your way,

495
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,160
wear these high heels and walk on fearlessly.

496
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:03,350
Everything that's going to happen from now on, I will be sure to prevail.

497
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,250
You don't know anything!

498
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,700
What do I not know?

499
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,360
Do you think your love is the only beautiful, ardent, and touching one in this world?

500
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,010
How dare you?!

501
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,120
You think you're so great?

502
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,350
Let go!

503
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,110
What are you doing? It's embarrassing!

504
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:38,190
If you know if it's embarrassing, why did you do something so filthy?

505
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,410
 You can die! Let go of me!

506
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,630
Let me go!

507
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,660
Dirty wench!

508
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,790
Oh my god! What the hell!

509
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,880
It's better to leave them alone.

510
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,390
So what is this?

511
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:06,860
Hye Rim's mom was having an affair?

512
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,380
Shouldn't we follow Hye Rim?

513
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,100
It's fine. What can we do?

514
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,600
But still, we should at least comfort her...

515
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,670
Comfort how?

516
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,290
Oh, my daughter!

517
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,880
What are you doing?

518
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,010
 I just got home from the academy.

519
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,650
We're eating snacks Miss Kim made for us.

520
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,440
Mom! Mom, there is huge news!

521
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,670
Mom and Dad, this time, are having a nice time. Do you want to ruin it for them?

522
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,280
Clueless...

523
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,490
Yeah, Mom.

524
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,390
What's wrong? Did something happen?

525
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,040
No, nothing happened.

526
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,220
Hand the phone to Tae Yong.

527
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,970
Here.

528
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:17,690
Mom.

529
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,280
Is something going on?

530
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,190
No, just...

531
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,750
I miss you, that's all.

532
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:27,350
I miss you, too, already.

533
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,610
But... it's all right if you come back a little later.

534
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,070
Have a nice time with Dad. I love you.

535
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,580
Yes, I love you, Son!

536
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,100
Will you be able to forget me?

537
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,770
If you ask me to forget you, I will.

538
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,970
If you ask me not to,

539
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:04,380
I won't. Should I not let you go?

540
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,260
You are letting me go for my sake, right?

541
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:27,420
As you said, I will live my life from now on.

542
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,520
You should also live your life.

543
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,480
I want to get drunk.

544
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,190
Wait here.

545
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:02,450
Han Seon Joo.

546
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,150
Here you go.

547
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,010
This is a gift to my queen, from my heart.

548
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,980
Gift?

549
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:28,590
Victoria that was the fashion show's finale?

550
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,520
Shoes that only you can wear.

551
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,620
Thank you, Honey.

552
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,410
Give them to me.

553
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,950
Here.

554
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,330
This side, too.

555
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,850
They look good.

556
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:16,040
Next time, let's come for a vacation with the kids, not for work.

557
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,320
I should record this.

558
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,520
Say that again, so I can record it.

559
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,720
Let's get going!

560
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,900
Record it later.

561
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,230
Careful with your head.

562
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:32,540

563
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,680
Hello?

564
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,880
Yes, I will be there right away.

565
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:04,310
It looks like you'll have to go back alone.

566
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,250
What's the matter?

567
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,730
Something's happened all of a sudden.

568
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:11,530
I think I need to go quickly.

569
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,150
I'll see you at home then.

570
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,790
Hold on...

571
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,230
Honey,

572
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,280
is it something bad?

573
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,310
No, nothing bad happened. Don't worry.

574
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,520
Get back safely.

575
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,340

576
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,610

577
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,010
 The call cannot be connected. You will be forwarded to voicemail.

578
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,420
 Please leave a message after the tone.

579
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,690
  This is the ER. You know Yoon Mi Ra, right?

580
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,900
 Your number showed up on the outgoing calls, so we called.

581
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,110
  Will you get in or not?

582
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,180
Oh...

583
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:54,170
 Miss Yoon Mi Ra took poison, so she's in the emergency room.

584
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,110

585
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,400
I'm here for Miss Yoon Mi Ra.

586
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,610
Are you awake?

587
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,690
Are you all right?

588
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,100
Why did you do something so foolish?

589
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,300
Mi Ra...

590
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,020
I didn't want to make it difficult for you.

591
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:35,410
That's why I wanted to break up...

592
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,450
Breaking up is the right thing to do, but...

593
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:14,920

594
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,070
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

595
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:32,610
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

596
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:36,970
♫  If you are still there  ♫

597
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:43,560
♫  To me, if you feel like that  ♫

598
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:49,040
♫  If there is anything left to tell, to me  ♫

599
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,450
♫  Anything is fine  ♫

600
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,550
♫  The bright lights of this city  ♫

601
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:01,560
♫  My footsteps have been erased  ♫

602
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,750

603
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,950
  Why are you being so nice to me?

604
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:10,800
 When I first saw you, you reminded me of my sister.

605
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,270
 Should I be your sister?

606
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:14,750
 Let's be sisters from now on.

607
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,500
 That woman, I heard she's a mistress.

608
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,990
 Don't talk about other people when it's just an unconfirmed rumor.

609
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,090
 That rumor is true.

610
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,680
 I'm in love with another woman's husband.

611
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,650
 As long as we are careful, nothing will go wrong.

612
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,570
 What if ... I'm not careful?

613
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,800
 You of all people! How could you do something like that!

614
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,610
 It's me, Han Seon Joo.

615
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,820
 Should we... meet?

616
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:51,550
♫  Hello. Sorry, I can't hear you well  ♫
