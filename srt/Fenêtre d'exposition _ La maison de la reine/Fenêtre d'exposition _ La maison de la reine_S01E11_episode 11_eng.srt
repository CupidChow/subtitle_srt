1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,950

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,480
We have a witness.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,680

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,360
 Just tell him comfortably everything you saw.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,540
 Yes, hurry up and tell him.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,010
 I...

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,510
 saw them.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,780
 The culprit.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,940
 You saw the culprit?

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,670
 That day...

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,750
 during Tae Yong's parents' remind wedding party. 
 (Remind wedding/vow renewal is a celebratory ceremony for a married couple to reaffirm their commitment to each other.)

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,020
 I went there to get Tae Yong's game pack.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,540
 Because he said I could borrow it.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,750
 I saw them then.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,030
 Clearly.

16
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,300
 The culprit is...

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,050

18
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,270

19
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,700
It's fine. Go home now.

20
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,430
I'll be there soon.

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,490
Come quickly.

22
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,730
Wait.

23
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,980
Tae Hee?

24
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,350
Tae Hee.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,130
What's the matter? What happened?

26
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,930
Tae Hee, tell me.

27
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,620
Tae Hee!

28
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,840
Oh, Tae Hee.

29
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,420
Did something happen to Tae Hee?

30
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,020
Tae Hee, what's the matter?

31
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,900
 Tae Hee. Open the door.

32
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,120
Tae Hee, open the door.

33
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,600
What's wrong with her again?

34
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,700
Go in your room, Tae Yong.

35
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,030
Let's talk, Tae Hee.

36
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,440
Tae Hee, can't you tell us what's wrong?

37
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,410
Leave me alone!

38
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,590
If you don't open the door, I'll unlock it and come in!

39
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,770
For now, it'll be best to give her space.

40
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,940
I think you've been neglecting the kids lately.

41
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,800
Then what about you?

42
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,800
I've never neglected them.

43
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,470
How long do you think sugar coating without any sincerity will last?

44
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,930
If you want to at least remain as their dad, be sincere instead of using petty tricks.

45
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,690

46
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,990

47
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,320
Where's your sister?

48
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,660
It's so annoying. Why doesn't she come down on her own?

49
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,290
Tae Hee, let's eat.

50
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,370
Tae Hee, you should eat first before you go!

51
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,570
Tae Hee.

52
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,580
What's the matter?

53
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,150
Can you tell me what's going on?

54
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,990
Tae Hee.

55
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,190
I have a student council meeting today. I have to be there early.

56
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,180
Then you should have told me sooner.

57
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,930
Wait, I'll take you.

58
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,630
No.

59
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,060
I'll take a taxi.

60
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,250
Myeong Seop.

61
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,220
Did something happen?

62
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,020
Sit down.

63
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,860
Mi Ra, there's something you need to do for me.

64
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,460
Isn't Director Choi being too irresponsible?

65
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,070
I know the situation is dire,

66
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,310
but still, how could he

67
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,590
suggest something so dangerous as the hedge fund?

68
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,730
I made the final decision. Director Choi isn't responsible.

69
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,240
Anyway, what do we do now? Next week, the stocks that we used as collateral

70
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,110
will end up going to Silver Stone completely.

71
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,140
Wouldn't it be better to tell the Chairwoman

72
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,220
and ask for help?

73
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,410
We can't.

74
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,820
If she collapses again, it'll be dangerous.

75
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,350
I'll tell her everything later,

76
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,400
so please don't make it obvious.

77
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,470
Yes, I understand.

78
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,690
Hi, honey. My mom asked me to come over.

79
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,460
My car's at the shop. I'll use yours. Okay.

80
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,430

81
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,790
Songdang District, Pahyeon Neighborhood?

82
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,810
Why did he go there? He doesn't even know anyone there.

83
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,820

84
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,220
What's this?

85
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,140
Do you have anything that really works?

86
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,420
This one makes it possible for you to track anyone through their cellphone.

87
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,810
It costs a bit, but it's effective and convenient, so it's popular.

88
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,870
And the location tracking error range?

89
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,680
It can track from a 3-meter range up to 5 meters.

90
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,430
Let's take this one.

91
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,890
I just called to ask about it. Thank you.

92
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,190
Be brave. From here on out, it's war.

93
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,960
 Did you not know that Tae Hee's been absent?

94
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,060
 Something has seemed strange with her lately.

95
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,680
 She'd fight with her friends over nothing, and she hasn't been able to concentrate during classes.

96
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,530
 The phone has been turned off. The call will be directed to voicemail.

97
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,740
 After the beep...

98
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,970
I heard you didn't go to the academy yesterday or today.

99
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,260
Where have you been?

100
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,710
- You don't need to know. 
 - What's the matter with you lately?

101
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,440
Why are you doing things that are so unlike you all of a sudden?

102
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,820
Shin Tae Hee!

103
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,750
Oh, honey. You must be tired.

104
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,110
Go and wash up first. Take a shower.

105
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,120
Go ahead and take a shower.

106
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,670
Oh, it's working.

107
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,510
What are you doing?

108
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,980
Oh, my back hurts.

109
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,350
Where did it go?

110
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,790
Wh-What?

111
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,130
That thing.

112
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,120
Oh, it's here. This?

113
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
Here.

114
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,730
You better use it regularly or you might start losing your hair.

115
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,780
What's wrong with my hair?

116
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,860
Anyway, using it regularly

117
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,150
seems to make a real difference.

118
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,210
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

119
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,330
Jeong Won.

120
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,230
Let's talk.

121
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,620
Oh, you were here?

122
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,800
Han Jeong Won.

123
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,950
I guess...

124
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,720
I've been very wrong about you.

125
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,390
I thought of you

126
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,950
the same way as I did Yeon Joo.

127
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,120
As my younger sibling.

128
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,910
I guess you didn't feel the same.

129
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't care what you do to me,

130
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,750
but I won't forgive you

131
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,950
if you hurt mom.

132
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,540
 The queen's chair is finally complete.

133
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,010
 Whenever you're tired and weary

134
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,920
 come at anytime and get good rest.

135
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,750
I'm pretty sure I warned you not to do anything I didn't ask.

136
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm not a marionette.

137
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm not a puppet that only does

138
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,570
what you ask me to or not do.

139
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,730
If you keep doing this, I can't help you anymore.

140
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,920
Help me? You?

141
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,310
Don't be ridiculous.

142
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,010
You used me in order to have Han Seon Joo.

143
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,900
Telling me to approach Han Jeong Won was your plan, too.

144
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,320
 They are fake, aren't they? Where did you get these shoes?

145
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,780
 You're wrong. I bought them at LaReine. They're real!

146
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,760
 Which store?

147
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,750
Revealing the scandal and scheduling it was also...

148
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,800
you.

149
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,350
It wasn't for my sake

150
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,770
but you did that in order to have Han Seon Joo for yourself.

151
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,940
Anyway,

152
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,630
I think it's time to stop working with you.

153
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,880
From now on,

154
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,970
I'll do what and how I want.

155
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,930
Nothing worked out by working with you.

156
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,880
That's not entirely true.

157
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,700
On the outside, it might seem like there hasn't been any change,

158
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,290
but between Shin Myeong Seop and Han Seon Joo,

159
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,320
a crack has started to form.

160
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,780
A crack?

161
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,430
The collapse of a great dam, too...

162
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,160
in the end,

163
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
it starts from a small crack.

164
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,370
 Yeah, Seon Joo. How come you're calling so early in the morning?

165
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,780
Do you have time tomorrow?

166
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,110
Seon Joo.

167
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,790
Sorry, it took so long. There was traffic coming here.

168
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,510
Is something wrong?

169
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,720
Seon Joo.

170
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,310
Why did you do it?

171
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,930
What?

172
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,830
Why did you do it?

173
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,250
Making Yoon Mi Ra approach Jeong Won...

174
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,530
was it your doing?

175
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,250
The one who put me through torture and gave me a scar that can't be erased,

176
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,210
it was you?

177
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,520
My friend...

178
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,050
My dear friend Cha Yeong Hoon.

179
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,420
Did you do it?

180
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,770
Tell me.

181
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,890
Hurry up and tell me!

182
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,950
Yes.

183
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,350
It was me. I did it.

184
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,660
Why?

185
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,000
Why would you?

186
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,350
Because you cried!

187
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,050
You cried in front of me.

188
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,780
How...

189
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,960
How could you do this to me?

190
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,690
I won't leave you with that trash-like bastard Shin Myeon Seop anymore.

191
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,510
I'll put you next to me again.

192
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:50,760
♫  Please tell me  ♫

193
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:58,140
♫  So I won't break this beautiful you  ♫

194
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,610
Don't ever call me again.

195
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,930
♫  Cry me a river on a day like this  ♫

196
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,630
♫  Cry me a river, the day I held you in my arms  ♫

197
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,210
Seon Joo. Seon Joo!

198
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,410
♫  I have to leave with a smile   ♫

199
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,800
♫  This road that will never come again  ♫

200
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,860
♫  Cry me a river  ♫

201
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,030
♫  I don't want you here  ♫

202
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,510
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im must have used LaReine Gallery for money laundering and slush funds.

203
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,360
I'd like you to find that evidence for me.

204
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,370
Is that why you put me in charge of the gallery?

205
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,680
If we can just find Chairwoman Kim's Achilles heel,

206
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,960
I can become the Chairman of LaReine right away.

207
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,110
Then you'll become LaReine's madam.

208
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,060
You want me to find the records of the slush funds, right?

209
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,490
Yes.

210
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,940
Did you need something?

211
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,970
I'm trying to take a look at the VVIP's transaction history of the gallery's pieces,

212
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,800
but it says access is restricted.

213
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,750
Oh, only a few people including Chairwoman Kim Kang Im

214
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,220
and Chief Director Han Seon Joo have access.

215
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,430
Give me access, too, right away.

216
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,900
I can't do that.

217
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,330
Why do you think I fired Section Chief Kim and gave you the position instead?

218
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,970
You still don't get it?

219
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,250
I'm the head of this gallery.

220
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,760
Not Chief Director Han Seon Joo.

221
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,640
I'm the one who's in charge of your livelihood.

222
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,020
But what's Auntie Mi Ra up to?

223
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,530
I haven't seen her lately.

224
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,580
Is she not marrying Uncle anymore?

225
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,110
Still, I'm a little sad that she decided to break off all ties with us.

226
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,720
We became pretty close.

227
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,760
Why don't you invite her over some time for dinner?

228
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,310
I miss Auntie Mi Ra.

229
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,980
Doesn't that sound good, Dad?

230
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,920
Well, she's broken things off with your uncle.

231
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,170
I'm not sure we need to see her anymore.

232
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,570
Where are you going?

233
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,880
There is something urgent going on at work.

234
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,180
But today's a holiday.

235
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,490
Also, in that outfit?

236
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,920
Well, I just need to take care of something quickly and come back.

237
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,750
I'll be back.

238
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,200
Nothing?

239
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,360
Among the transaction VVIP details,

240
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,260
I looked through every transaction record with influential political figures,

241
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,430
but nothing came up.

242
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,300
So there are no illegal transactions or slush funds?

243
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,460
There are four ways to end a chess game.

244
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,560
Checkmate, draw,

245
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,850
dropping out, and also...

246
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,680
when time's up.

247
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,820
I'm saying that I need time right now.

248
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,390
Time?

249
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,630
Until I end up on the throne,

250
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,210
I need something that won't give Chairwoman Kim any way out.

251
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,610
Time.

252
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,330
Let's do this.

253
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,720
Jeong Won.

254
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,660
You should have woken me up if you were here.

255
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,970
Why are you leaving?

256
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,770
Why? Were you bothered about

257
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,190
saying hurtful things to me?

258
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,300
I understand.

259
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,730
So don't be too bothered.

260
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

261
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,550
Don't treat me like a chairwoman here, too.

262
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,670
Why not call me "mother" like you're supposed to?

263
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,580
Get up. If someone sees, they'll think

264
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm being harsh toward my stepson again.

265
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,450
Why do you look so unwell?

266
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,570
Have you been eating properly?

267
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,800
Since you met the woman who gave birth to you after 30 years,

268
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,850
I'm sure you had lots of feelings,

269
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,140
but... I've never kept

270
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,290
you and your mom away from each other.

271
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,090
I know.

272
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,150
I know well that she

273
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,340
took money from you and

274
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,330
threw me away.

275
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,660
I also remember how she threatened you.

276
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,060
If you didn't give her money,

277
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,300
she was going to kill herself and me right then and there.

278
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:41,450
You... remember that?

279
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,030
I've never once...

280
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,230
blamed you.

281
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,830
You didn't show it,

282
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,180
but I know that you always worried about me,

283
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,450
and helped me quietly.

284
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,080
For never once

285
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,570
giving you warmth...

286
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,630
I'm sorry.

287
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,520
Jeong Won, thank you.

288
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,290
For growing up so well.

289
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,300
All this time...

290
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,640
it must have been so hard for you.

291
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,530
I'm sorry.

292
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,860
You nearly hurt me.

293
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,660
I wanted to trick Brother-in-Law, so I had no choice.

294
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:25,010
I had to fool even you, in order for him to believe me.

295
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,710
Now, I'll keep track of his every move.

296
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,710
LaReine...

297
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,490
can never go to

298
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,280
Shin Myeong Seop instead of you.

299
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Tae Hee.

300
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,840
Can you speak with me for a moment?

301
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,240
Mom, I want to eat French food for dinner tonight.

302
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,890
What?

303
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,380
Escargot for the appetizer.

304
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,740
Can you do that especially for me?

305
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,210
All right.

306
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,650
If my daughter wants to eat it,

307
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,770
I'll prepare it.

308
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
I'll go now.

309
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,460

310
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,270
 Until I end up on the throne,

311
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,930
 I need something that won't give Chairwoman Kim any way out.

312
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,080
 Time.

313
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,960
Hello?

314
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,320
- It looks good! 
 - Why escargot all of a sudden?

315
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,050
I asked Mom to make it.

316
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,880
I invited a very special guest.

317
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,570
I'll go get the door.

318
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,590
Aunt-in-Law Mi Ra!

319
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,910
- I mean... Aunt Mi Ra. 
 - Hi.

320
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,740
Tae Hee invited me to dinner.

321
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,100
Tae Hee, if you were going to invite a guest,

322
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,520
you should have told your mom and me first.

323
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,880
Sorry. I just wanted to give you a surprise.

324
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,360
Why? oes that make you uncomfortable?

325
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,320
Well?

326
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,050
No... I just mean from here on out.

327
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,910
Everybody hurry and eat.

328
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,410
Eat a lot, Aunt Mi Ra.

329
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,050
Thanks.

330
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,770
Yes, let's eat.

331
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,630
After raising the escargot by grabbing it with the tongs,

332
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,880
you can use the fork to slide out the insides.

333
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,010
This is how you do it.

334
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,440
Okay, thanks.

335
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,780
Oh no! This must be your first time having escargot.

336
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,980
I'll go find a wet wipe...

337
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,420
Dad!

338
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,170
Do you remember?

339
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,720
When our family went to France, we toured an old castle.

340
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,970
The restaurant famous for escargot was next to Chenonceau Castle.

341
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:49,110
That's right! You drove 2 hours on country roads yourself.

342
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,710
That was so tiring.

343
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,060
I want to go to that restaurant again!

344
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,010
We went to that restaurant especially, after dad searched hard to find it for our mom.

345
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,970
Dad, you remember, right?

346
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,190
Let's go there again for our next family trip.

347
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,020
How did you come here? You should have at least said something to me first.

348
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,120
How can you say that after seeing what I look like right now?

349
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,600
This was all planned by your daughter.

350
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,540
Tae Hee did this? Why would she?

351
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,430
I don't know.

352
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,430
Dad!

353
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,840
Where are you going?

354
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,210
What?

355
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,930
You didn't say anything to Tae Hee, did you?

356
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,860
Like what?

357
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,360
Ah, that you and Yoon Mi Ra

358
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,020
are having an affair?

359
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,960
Watch what you say.

360
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,740
It's not my fault alone that we became like this.

361
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,450
So are you saying that it's my fault?

362
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,020
Every relationship has two sides.

363
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,480
Don't try and spin it like it's all my fault.

364
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,360
What is it?

365
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,170
Tae Hee.

366
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:36,380
If you have something to tell me, say it at any time.

367
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,560
Okay, I will.

368
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,330
Mom, today's dinner was really delicious. Especially the escargot.

369
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,360
Mom, I have to study now.

370
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,180
All right.

371
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,820
Chief Director Han Seon Joo's stocks that have been acquired by Silver Stone as collateral will be handed over completely next week.

372
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,940
Make it so that we can purchase those stocks again.

373
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,450
No matter how much they ask for.

374
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,980
Yes, the talks have already been finished.

375
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,230
The price will certainly be quite high, but we can handle it well.

376
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,160
Until the regular general stockholder meeting next month,

377
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,750
- hurry so that the purchase can be completed. 
 - I will.

378
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,690
And what is the current state of the shares?

379
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,400
Well, if we assume that we are purchasing all of Chief Director Han Seon Joo's stocks

380
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,350
that Chief Director Han Seon Joo handed over to the Silver Stone hedge fund company in Hong Kong,

381
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,370
we will be 0.2 percent above Chairwoman Kim Kang Im's share.

382
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,510
I think that the strike in the Philippines was really a stroke of genius.

383
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:14,200
If someone were to hear, they would think that I planned the strike in the Philippines.

384
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,650
I mean, I didn't mean...

385
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,050
I just mean, it's a relief that the strike in the Philippines was resolved well.

386
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,110
The decision must not have been easy, thank you Team Leader Han.

387
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,270
For giving me strength.

388
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,780
It's nothing.

389
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,400
It was the obvious choice for LaReine.

390
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,400
I told you you should stay at the hospital for a bit longer.

391
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,810
Home is more comfortable, though.

392
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,180
How is Mother's condition?

393
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,700
She's all right.

394
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,550
That's a relief.

395
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,630
Sis, the situation is really not good at the moment.

396
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,820
 President Shin will definitely plan something else.

397
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,320
Is there still no news on the Chinese broker?

398
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,520
I'm looking for them with help from Chairman Go,

399
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,350
 but it seems like it will be difficult.

400
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,920
That's the last bastion...

401
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,460
 This is a big problem.

402
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,700
How is it going with the illegal transaction ledger?

403
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,510
It's all done.

404
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,250
All right.

405
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,120
Then hand it over to me as soon as possible.

406
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,640
Got it.

407
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,590
Tell me the truth.

408
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,340
Quickly!

409
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:01,700
Chief Director Han Seon Joo said I had to keep my lips sealed to you at all costs.

410
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,120
Speak!

411
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,580
I'm telling you to hurry up and tell me!

412
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,280
The truth is...

413
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,200
President Shin Myeong Seop.

414
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,190
Yes, Ma'am.

415
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,380
Get out.

416
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,700
I'm telling you to get out of LaReine Group.

417
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,950
Get out! Immediately!

418
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,760
Why should I?

419
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,610
Director! Something urgent has happened.

420
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,330
The prosecution suddenly stormed in...

421
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,970
What is going on?

422
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,680
I'm Prosecutor Hwang Byeong Gook from Seoul Central District Prosecution Office.

423
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,220
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im,

424
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,160
under suspicion of violating the Political Fund Law,

425
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,780
has been reported to the prosecution.

426
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,740
What did you say?

427
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,400
She's here!

428
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,190
Chairwoman Kim, is it true that you are suspected of managing political funds?

429
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,410
Do you acknowledge the charge?

430
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,780
How did you raise the slush fund?

431
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,320
Please give us a statement!

432
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,660
Do you acknowledge that you provided a large number of campaign funds to Chun Sang Yeop, a former presidential candidate?

433
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,700
Is it true that LaReine has been laundering money through an affiliate?

434
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,970
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im! You have been summoned under suspicions of illegal political funds, please say something!

435
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,760
I, Kim Kang Im, as a business person of the Republic of Korea,

436
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,190
take pride in the fact that I cultivated my company transparently,

437
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,740
with a philosophy of firmly and rigidly

438
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,210
operating within the borders of the law.

439
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,400
I apologize for causing the general population to feel anxieties

440
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,720
due to my being involved in something so shameful.

441
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,990
In the future, I will face the prosecution's investigation faithfully.

442
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,090
Did you look into it?

443
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,670
Someone reported to the prosecution's side that Assemblyman Cheon Sang Yeop and LaReine Gallery

444
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,040
were violating the Political Fund Law.

445
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,490
LaReine Gallery?

446
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,820
It's Shin Myeong Seop, isn't it?

447
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:40,260
I don't know yet. It seems like he's been thoroughly keeping it a secret, even from me.

448
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,050
The prosecution did a search-and-seizure of the gallery,

449
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,510
and it seems like they uncovered suspicious transaction details in the artwork transaction record.

450
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:50,370
There's no way, I know it!

451
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,720
Chief Prosecutor, I really owe you for this one. Yes.

452
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,630
Please conduct the investigation thoroughly.

453
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,480
I will go to greet you in person soon.

454
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,410
Goodbye.

455
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:20,690
We've earned some time since she's been summoned, but...

456
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:36,150
Chief Director Han Seon Joo's stocks that were given to Silver Stone as collateral...

457
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,060
Buy them up.

458
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,590
As planned.

459
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,460
- We'll be on our way then... 
 - Yes.

460
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,690
What brings you here?

461
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,310
Let my mother out immediately.

462
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,020
Mother-in-Law's health is bad too... this is really not good.

463
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,280
Since Lawyer Ahn and the company's law team are doing their best, don't worry.

464
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,510
No. Right now. Let her out right now!

465
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,020
I understand that you are worried right now,

466
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,760
but what power do I have over the prosecution?

467
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,690
Do you really need to go this far?

468
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,820
What do you mean?

469
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:55,220
Are you saying that I reported Mother-in-Law or something?

470
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,080
I will do everything I can.

471
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,170
So that Chairwoman, no, Mother-in-Law, can come out soon.

472
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,700
I didn't do it.

473
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,220
I know.

474
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,550
Mom, you trust me, don't you?

475
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:31,370
I, your daughter, Han Seon Joo,

476
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,850
am going to protect LaReine,

477
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,880
you and myself...

478
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,510
perfectly.

479
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,940
I'm your daughter.

480
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,630
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im's daughter.

481
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,600
You trust me, right?

482
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:12,920
Of course, I do.

483
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:21,640
My daughter, Han Seon Joo.

484
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,590
I trust you.

485
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,610
Mom.

486
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,020
Yes?

487
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,840
Will grandma be okay?

488
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:19,180
Of course. She will be fine.

489
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,660
Sorry.

490
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,660
I didn't know you were having a hard time, and I made things harder for you.

491
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,380
You're going through so much.

492
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,770
I feel so bad for you, Mom.

493
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:52,340
Grandma will be out soon and nothing will happen.

494
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,010
So don't cry, Tae Hee.

495
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,590
I'm fine.

496
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:01,790
No. You're not, Mom.

497
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,780
You're not fine at all.

498
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,970
What do you mean?

499
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,060
I saw.

500
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,610
Saw what?

501
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,230
Yoon Mi Ra, that woman...

502
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:21,150
kissing dad in this house. I saw them.

503
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,530
Tae Hee!

504
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,650
Oh, Tae Hee!

505
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,130
Oh, Tae Hee! Oh no!

506
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,860
Tae Hee!

507
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:49,160
I loved dad so much!

508
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:54,310
I loved and respected him so much!

509
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:59,340
How could he do that to you?

510
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:04,400
How could he do that to you and us?!

511
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,830
I...

512
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,560
knew about it.

513
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,940
You knew?

514
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,580
Yes.

515
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:40,420
I did.

516
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,050
Why didn't you do anything?

517
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,270
Since I'm your mom.

518
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,670
I can...

519
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,510
bear with anything

520
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,980
as long as you and Tae Yong are happy,

521
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,380
no matter what it is.

522
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,720
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

523
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,270
Don't just bear it! Why would you do that?!

524
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:14,820
I'm fine, Tae Hee.

525
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,130
♫ I guess how I feel ♫

526
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,810
How can you be fine?

527
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,740
Why do you always say that you're fine?!

528
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,590
Don't just bear it. Don't do that!

529
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:33,220
♫  I think all that’s in my head has been replaced somehow  ♫

530
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,060
♫  My god, I feel the open wounds come back to me  ♫

531
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,760
Are you stupid?

532
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,520
When you're unhappy,

533
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,200
when you're going through hell, how can I be happy?

534
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,840
I can be happy only when you are happy.

535
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,260
My Tae Hee...

536
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:07,260
From now on, I'll protect you.

537
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:13,170
I'm going to protect you so that Yoon Mi Ra can't hurt you.

538
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,460
So just trust me and rely on me.

Congratulations,

01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,300
Chairman Shin Myeong Seop.

♫  For you to see I’m no company  ♫

~ Preview ~

548
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,230
 We're almost there now. Us being happy is the only thing that remains.

549
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:31,960
 Be prepared to deal with the consequences of everything you've done.

550
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,760
 I changed my mind.

551
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,220
 I'm not divorcing you.

552
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,960
 You can keep living as a mistress.

553
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,640
 I saw.

554
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,970
 I saw you. I'll never forgive you.

555
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:48,430
 - There's a problem. 
 - Where the hell are these shoes coming from?

556
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,100
 I think someone must have betrayed us.

557
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,880
 Do you remember the imitation product incident from two years ago?

558
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,780
 I told you that Mi Ra took all the transaction files.

559
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,400
  Was it you, by chance?

560
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,290
 Was it?

561
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,260
 How could you suspect me?!

562
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,390
 I don't think we have anything left to discuss.

563
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,570
 Tell me what it is that Han Seon Joo wants.

564
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,290
♫  Save the days  ♫

565
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,960
 Where are you?

566
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,390
♫  These walls can come right over me like I’m insane  ♫

567
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,140
♫  I’ve loved someone  ♫
