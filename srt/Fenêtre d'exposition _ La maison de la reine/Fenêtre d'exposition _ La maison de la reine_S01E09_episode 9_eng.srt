1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,250

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,950
We found your fingerprint on this knife.

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,890
It wasn't me.

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,720
Of course, it's Han Seon Joo.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,420
Look. Her husband's mistress

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,080
appeared at their "remind wedding."

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,760
How could you leave her alone? I couldn't do it!

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,550
I would kill her, too.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,910
Are you going to deny it when there's clear evidence?

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,660
This knife

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,800
is our kitchen knife.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,400
Obviously my prints would be on it.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,470
Yes, obviously.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,950
But that's not all.

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,730
Seon Joo didn't do it.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,830
She would never put blood on her hands.

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,180
She'd make someone else do it.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,560

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,830

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,810
What is it?

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,380
Mom... Father...

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,560
They said that Father passed away.

24
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,150
We can't leave him like that.

25
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,730
Where is his body?

26
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,580
At the police station body storage facility in Canada.

27
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,620
If he left his family behind,

28
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,600
he should have lived well. Why did he become a vagrant

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,700
and die so terribly out on the street?

30
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,690
He was punished by the heavens for his sins...

31
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,890
Mom.

32
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,700
In what state that man died,

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,480
I need to see with my own eyes.

34
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,410
I'll go.

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,590
I'll go there and...

36
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,140
bring your father back...

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,840
home.

38
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,620
Yeah, Mom.

39
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,930
Bring him home.

40
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,110
While you bring him back,

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,220
I'll protect LaReine.

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,440
Protect?

43
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,630
What do you mean?

44
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,020
Chairwoman position.

45
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,610
It's an important position you can't leave empty even for a moment.

46
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,390
I'll fill your vacancy

47
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,720
by acting as your deputy.

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,220
So don't worry and get back safe.

49
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,270
President Shin Myeong Seop, you may stop now.

50
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,780
Due to personal reasons, the chairwoman will be absent today.

51
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,110
She has appointed her daughter,

52
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,680
Han Seon Joo, Chairwoman of Haesol Foundation,

53
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,270
to act as deputy chairwoman.

54
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,220
Two years ago, Yeongwon Leather...

55
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,190
counterfeit incident evidence...

56
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,650
I finally got my hands on it.

57
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,200
I know why you called an emergency board of directors meeting.

58
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,350
It would be best to give up your plans now.

59
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,950
Even though it's just for a short while, I will do my best

60
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,170
for LaReine Group as the deputy chairwoman.

61
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
President Shin Myeong Seop, let's work hard together.

62
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,290
I never imagined you would come back to work for the company.

63
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,980
But... where is Chairwoman Kim?

64
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,790

65
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,890
To get my father.

66
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,390
What do you mean?

67
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,450
He passed away in Canada.

68
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,140
Your father passed away?

69
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,520
So she went to Canada?

70
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,790
Yeah.

71
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,470
But what did you mean earlier?

72
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,960
In the meeting room?

73
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,420
What is the counterfeit incident two years ago, and what do you mean by my "plans"?

74
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,230
Two years ago, fake Korean brands were sold to China.

75
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,890
And I got the evidence.

76
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,490
Evidence?

77
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,060
You were mentioned in the USB.

78
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,370
Do you need any more explanation?

79
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,040
It wasn't me.

80
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,120
Never.

81
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,100
You said you got evidence.

82
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,650
Why hesitate? Report it.

83
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,890
 I looked at the evidence.

84
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,100
 There is overflowing evidence of having done illegal business with China,

85
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:11,160
 but there was absolutely no evidence that brother-in-law was involved.

86
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,310
 He's a meticulous person.

87
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,740
 Firstly, by reverse tracking the distribution network,

88
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,610
 I'll find the illegal brokers.

89
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,060
 All right.

90
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,260
Things are a bit complicated right now.

91
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,280
After my mother brings my father from Canada and the funeral is carried out,

92
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,820
I'll take care of it.

93
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,340
You're trying to corner me with pointless accusations.

94
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,380
You could come to regret this later.

95
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,330
Could I regret anything more...

96
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,610
than the fact that you are my husband?

97
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,690
If Seon Joo becomes the chairwoman, what will happen to you? Will you be fired from the partner law firm?

98
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,700
Fired? Who would fire me?

99
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,860
I'm Ahn Do Hyeok, damn it.

100
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,930
So, why did you stand in Executive Director Shin's line?

101
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,560
You should have properly judged who the real authority is.

102
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,050
In the morning, it's Kim Kang Im; at lunchtime, it's Shin Myeong Seop.

103
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,150
In the evening, it's Han Seon Joo. How can I line myself up when they're taking turns being in the power position?

104
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,240
So what are you going to do?

105
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,420
Oh! You said President Son came back to work.

106
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,020
So are you really in danger–

107
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,250
President Son is just a provisional consultation director!

108
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,830
He's not in charge of the jewelry division.

109
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,240
Hi, everybody!

110
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,030
Wow, what is everyone so serious about?

111
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,880
You saw him last time, right?

112
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,670
My new boyfriend, David. Say hello, everyone!

113
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,180
Nice to meet you, I am David. From now on, I will be seeing you all often.

114
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,780
Often? Maybe for 2 months at the longest?

115
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,900
We are in the middle of an important conversation, would you mind leaving?

116
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,260
I heard that Seon Joo rose to the chairwoman position.

117
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,680
Not chairwoman, deputy chairwoman!

118
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,020
In life, we always end up at the crossroads of choice.

119
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,530
Who will be the final winner?

120
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,090
Which line should one stand in?

121
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,310
Everyone, choose carefully.

122
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,550
David, follow me!

123
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,590
 - I... have something to give you, so I came to find– 
 - Is what you want...

124
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,870
 a situation like this?

125
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,830
 Myeong Seop, I...

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,210
 Go back.

127
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,820
 For the time being, it would be best for us to not see each other.

128
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,800
 I came to find you to give you this!

129
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,620
 - What is that? 
 - Your Achilles heel.

130
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,280
 The case file from 2 years ago.

131
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,660
 Han Seon Joo said that if I found this for her she would divorce you.

132
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,360
 What should I do? Should I go bring this to her now?

133
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,220
 Wait a second.

134
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,560
 What you're saying...

135
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,950
 explain it again clearly.

136
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:49,340
 It's the invoice file containing the transaction details from the Yeongwon Leather imitation product case 2 years ago.

137
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,020
 Inside is a list of the Chinese brokers you contacted.

138
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,110
 Seon Joo told you to find that?

139
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,680
 Yes.

140
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,590
 But I couldn't give it to her at all.

141
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,400
 Because I know what will happen to you if she gets it.

142
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,290
 I'll give it to you.

143
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,220
 It's the only evidence left in this world.

144
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,050
 Thank you.

145
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,420
 As expected, you are the only one on my side.

146
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,560
What was the result?

147
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,070
Did it go the way you wanted?

148
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,390
The meeting was postponed.

149
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,250
So, in the end, everything is the same, with no changes.

150
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,320
Well,

151
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,850
it happened that way. I'll wait for another opportunity.

152
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,570
 But, Mi Ra, are you certain

153
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,040
that no one knows about the USB's data?

154
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,570
Yes. The one I gave you is the only evidence left in the world.

155
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,940
Got it. I'll contact you after I get things under control.

156
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,340

157
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,740
Yes.

158
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,210
What is it at this time of night?

159
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,080
I came to get the real data.

160
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,780
I gave it to you.

161
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,400
There is no more data for me to give you.

162
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,220
You know yourself that the data you gave me is useless!

163
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,410
Did I?

164
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,740
What to do? I did my best to find it...

165
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,590
Anyway, I kept my promise, and now it's time for you to keep yours.

166
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,060
Divorce Shin Myeong Seop.

167
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,920
You sure are shameless.

168
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,790
It wasn't enough to scar my innocent brother, you still lie to the end?

169
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,720
Innocent brother?

170
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,910
Then, what about my baby?

171
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,290
What sin did my baby commit to die without even seeing the light of day?

172
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,070
I... still dream of my baby every night.

173
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,940
That may be so, but that doesn't make your actions fair.

174
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,950
It's the fault of your mistaken love.

175
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:56,350
I gave you a chance, and you're the one who ruined that chance.

176
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,210
Don't be mistaken, Yoon Mi Ra.

177
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,210
You and Shin Myeong Seop are the ones that started all of this,

178
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,280
and the two of you will pay the price.

179
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,370
For sure.

180
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,610
Please hurry.

181
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,750
It looks like the game is going to end too easily.

182
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,830
She's not the type to make a lot of noise with nothing to back it...

183
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,770
Yes, it's me.

184
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,670
Let's meet for a bit.

185
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,760
Didn't you say that the Chinese broker documents from back then... had all been disposed of?

186
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,550
But why...

187
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,140
is that data still left?

188
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,230
I got rid of everything. Was one left?

189
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,070
I apologize.

190
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,020
Can I trust that you have never given that data to anyone else?

191
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,190
Of course, I swear over my dead parents.

192
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,190
I would never give Han Seon J–

193
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,330
No, I have never given it to anyone.

194
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,040
And to be honest, that bitch–

195
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,360
Mi Ra took everything, so there's nothing left on the company computer.

196
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,280
Even if I really wanted to give something away, I have nothing to give!

197
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,240
I need to get my hands on the real evidence soon...

198
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,100
Yes, Secretary Lee.

199
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Chief Director, something has come up.

200
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
What happened?

201
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,880
The chairwoman collapsed due to a cerebral stroke and is now in the hospital.

202
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,010
What did you say?

203
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:00,280
Chairwoman, it's the chief director.

204
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,610
I'm okay.

205
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,530
Mom!

206
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,660
Since it's not that serious, you have nothing to worry about.

207
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,070
It's something common that happens to older people.

208
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,220
 My secretary brought me to the hospital very quickly.

209
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,500
And I got a stent surgery done right away.

210
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,360
Now, I'm in the middle of recovering. It's really not serious.

211
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,950
I... I'll go there.

212
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,720
I'll be back in Korea in no time. There's no need for you to come.

213
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,220
It'll only be cumbersome.

214
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,150
 I have to go get examined,

215
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,870
so let's call again later.

216
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,300
What? What's the issue?

217
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,130
She said that she's in the hospital after collapsing from a cerebral stroke.

218
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,710
What?

219
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,090
Team Leader Han Jeong Won left the country to go to Canada?

220
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,400
Yes.

221
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,840
So suddenly? Why?

222
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,500
Officially, it was a business trip, but...

223
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,960
Unofficially?

224
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,910
I received a secret call from the Canadian branch manager,

225
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,040
and they said that the chairwoman collapsed from a cerebral stroke.

226
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,550
Thankfully, she's doing fine after receiving a simple procedure.

227
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,890
Secretary Kang.

228
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,550
Yes?

229
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,130
You said that the factory in the Philippines is ready to run, correct?

230
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:48,610
Yes. At your command, things can proceed immediately. Everything has been prepared.

231
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,570
Make the call. Tell them to start immediately.

232
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,610
Yes, understood.

233
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,660

234
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,020

235
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,020
I don't see Director Choi.

236
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,010
Ah, yes. I'll give him a call.

237
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,050
Where are you now?

238
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,610
Why are you not coming?

239
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,600
Excuse me? Where did you say?

240
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,080
Yes, I understand.

241
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,740
Director Choi is in the middle of rounding.

242
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,250
He's out meeting with buyers.

243
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,550
Did you hear the rumor?

244
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,780
What rumor?

245
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,770
That Seon Joo's dad died.

246
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,790
On top of that, he died miserably wandering the streets of Canada.

247
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,400
Ex-husband of the founder and chairwoman of the great LaReine Group

248
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,680
died a beggar.

249
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,240
Life is just...

250
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,850
Wow, Seon Joo must have gotten a shock.

251
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,230
Right? But that isn't the shocking thing.

252
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,960
There is something else that's more shocking.

253
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,290
What is the more shocking thing?

254
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,470
The two of you really don't know? But there's no one in Gangnam that doesn't know this rumor...

255
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,060
So? What's the rumor?

256
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,640
Executive Director Shin and Han Seon Joo,

257
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,870
both have their own separate lovers.

258
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,200
There's no way!

259
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,750
The two of them would never do something like that.

260
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,050
Their marital relationship is so good!

261
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,410
It's always that you can know everything

262
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,560
except what's inside a person's heart.

263
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,100
Well, it's true that what you see is different from reality.

264
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,520
It's possible that there's something we don't know.

265
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,330
But who do they say are the lovers?

266
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,340
You said they both have separate lovers.

267
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,530
I don't really know about Executive Director Shin,

268
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:48,680
as for Han Seon Joo's lover... they're saying it's that famous psychiatrist,

269
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,950
the one who's on TV often, Cha Yeong Hoon.

270
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,570
What? Why are you guys reacting like that?

271
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:03,040
Cha Yeong Hoon is Seon Joo's best friend.

272
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,760
It was a groundless rumor after all.

273
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,070
I thought you actually knew something.

274
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,140
It's time to go to the academy, so let's go.

275
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,570
I want to play a little longer, though...

276
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,540
You should hurry and get up.

277
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,810
If you get there late, your mom will scold you more.

278
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,490
But wait, I heard that your parents are getting a divorce?

279
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,570
Divorce?

280
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,470
That's why your dad... left home they said.

281
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,890
Who said that?

282
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,410
Did you not know? That your parents are getting a divorce?

283
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,120
No...

284
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,190
Hey, it's true. I heard my mom talking about it.

285
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,410
I said it's not!

286
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,620
Thank you.

287
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,070
Drive safely.

288
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,540
Mom, I'm out of my herbal medicine. Did you not buy anymore for me?

289
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,380
Really? I didn't know.

290
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,510
Sorry. I'll call the oriental medicine doctor and order more.

291
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,450
Then make Miss Kim do it instead!

292
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,680
You're already stressed from company work, why do you have to do all of the housework, too?

293
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,570
I'm so busy lately, that I just couldn't take care of it ahead of time.

294
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,460
Sorry.

295
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,950
You know about the joint entrance briefing session by ivy league college admissions officers, right?

296
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,310
Really? Okay, I'll request–

297
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,780
You haven't done it yet?!

298
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,450
I'll do it today immediately.

299
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,460
Why is she acting like that?

300
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,300
Son...

301
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,810
Come give me a hug.

302
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,390
But Mom...

303
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,010
After making his face like this... Oh, what to do?

304
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,400
I'm so upset, what can I do?

305
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,440
Tae Yong, you hit Jeong Gook?

306
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,360
Why?

307
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,460
Tell me. Why did you hit Jeong Gook?

308
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,340
He was lying and saying you and dad were getting divorced!

309
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,020
He said he heard his own parents talking about it.

310
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,530
Saying that my parents are getting divorced...

311
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,010
What? Hey, when did I say such a thing?!

312
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,330
Kids can end up fighting when they play together.

313
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,280
Isn't that right?

314
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,830
We should leave.

315
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,630
Say goodnight.

316
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,450
Sorry for calling you out so late.

317
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,340
We'll be off!

318
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,290
Your dad and I are not getting divorced.

319
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,510
Really?

320
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,180
Of course.

321
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,710
I knew it.

322
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,850
Did you worry, Son?

323
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,340
Yes.

324
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,610
I was so annoyed... and scared.

325
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,620
Like a baby.

326
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,360
Don't worry.

327
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,150
A state of emergency?

328
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,890
Strike?

329
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,810
I received an urgent call from the Philippine factory's branch manager.

330
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,970
Today, the factory workers suddenly went on strike.

331
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,500
What do those people want?

332
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,690
A clear employment guarantee and wage increase until retirement.

333
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,590
Things will be okay for now,

334
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,170
but if the strike continues for more than a week, there will be supply problems

335
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,190
and we'll receive claim requests.

336
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,750
If that happens, the penalty for breach of contract will be...

337
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,150
Secretary Kang, about the Philippine factory,

338
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:27,610
you cannot allow the strike to stop until I give the order.

339
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:35,740
Also, quietly spread gossip in the financial sector that the biggest factory of LaReine Group that's

340
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,550
in the Philippines is on strike.

341
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,800
Issues have to happen altogether like this...

342
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,460
First, recruit a replaceable factory by mobilizing all of the overseas team.

343
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,710
If the Philippines is not possible, find out if we can use the factory

344
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,280
in Vietnam we dealt with until last year.

345
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,230
I think you should go to the Philippines, President Son.

346
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,800
You need to go and see the situation firsthand and

347
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,180
deal with the factory workers on strike.

348
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,400
All right, I understand.

349
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,800

350
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,150
The escape game level is a bit higher with this one.

351
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,780
This one is...

352
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,070
Hi, Mom.

353
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,400
Where are you?

354
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Here? Escape Cafe.

355
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,050
Why are you there?  Shouldn't you need to be at the academy?

356
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,620
Dad.

357
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,580
It's me.

358
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,870
What are you doing right now?!

359
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,350
Wait a minute.

360
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,040
Speak.

361
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,600
What are you doing right now?!

362
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
I'm trying to have some fun with the kids. Why?

363
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,560
Dad.

364
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,760
Kids are calling me, I'll hang up.

365
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,810
Is it really difficult?

366
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,970
Should we take a look at all of them again?

367
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,410
 Were you scared?

368
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,890
 It was fun, but I was a little scared.

369
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,430
 You guys do know what time is right now?

370
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,530
 Where is your dad?

371
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,420
 He left already.

372
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,900
 You skipped academy! What are you doing?!

373
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,920
 Then, Mom, what are you doing?

374
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,080
 - What? 
 - This isn't right.

375
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,410
 Tell me so that I can understand!

376
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,530
 How can you forget your son's birthday?

377
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,260
Drink up.

378
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,980
Thank you.

379
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
I happened to have a doctor friend from my time at  Boston Medical University

380
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,340
where your mother is hospitalized,

381
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,990
so I asked him

382
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,390
what her condition is right now.

383
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,000
It's true that she was in danger, but they treated her quickly,

384
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,590
and the stent surgery went well,

385
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,190
but she can't get on a plane right away, so her return trip is being delayed.

386
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,780
You can't take her condition lightly.

387
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,800
Once she comes back to Korea, she needs complete rest.

388
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,940
It looks like she might be okay right now,

389
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,040
but she's older and you don't know when it could reoccur.

390
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:00,380
Also, if it reoccurs, no one can guarantee the outcome.

391
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,640
So no matter what, she needs absolute rest. Okay?

392
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,710
Okay, I'll do that.

393
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,900
How are you doing? Is company work doable?

394
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,430
It's a mess.

395
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,750
Office work and housework.

396
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:26,080
I... didn't realize I was this incompetent.

397
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,690
You're not incompetent.

398
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,970
It's because you haven't worked in a while. Of course, things won't go smoothly right away.

399
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,570
The work "incompetent" doesn't suit the great Han Seon Joo.

400
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,400
The only one who understands me...

401
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,300
is my friend Cha Yeong Hoon.

402
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,910
Yes.

403
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,330
We already located the woman you asked to find.

404
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,660
Really?

405
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,100
Here.

406
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,320
But... who is she?

407
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,030
Why are you searching for her?

408
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,180
She's someone who will hand over LaReine to us for certain.

409
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,050
This person.

410
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,710

411
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,720
Is this Producer Moon Sang Hyeon?

412
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,340
I am Yoon Mi Ra.

413
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,990
If everything you just told me is true,

414
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,400
do you have clear evidence to prove it all?

415
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,350
Yes, I have the evidence.

416
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,340
You found a replaceable factory?

417
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,560
Yes. A factory LaReine used last year is available thankfully.

418
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,000
Tell them to start it up.

419
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,580
But...

420
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,380
there's a bigger problem than the factory issue.

421
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,190
Due to the strike in the Philippines, there have been disruptions in domestic supply and demand.

422
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,240
From various companies,

423
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,500
claims are coming in.

424
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,410
Make sure to pay enough for the damages.

425
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,190
There's not much left after putting in funds for the Vietnam plant,

426
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,850
so cash management funds are far too short.

427
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,950
Jeong Won.

428
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,750
How is Mom's condition today?

429
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,210
She's fine.

430
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,010
 Don't worry too much.

431
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,760
When do you think she'll be able to come back?

432
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,600
Well, she still needs rest,

433
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,250
so I think we need to stay a little longer.

434
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,750
I'll put her on the phone. Just a second.

435
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,590
Mom.

436
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,240
 I said I'm fine.

437
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,090
It was treatment, not even surgery.

438
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,700
I want to come home at once, but the doctors are stopping me.

439
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,410
You must be having a hard time all on your own.

440
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,310
Without even Jeong Won, all alone...

441
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,540
What's your husband up to?

442
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,790
You know, not much.

443
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,820
How about the company? Is everything okay?

444
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,400
Everything's fine here so just focus on your recovery.

445
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,700
Okay,

446
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,800
  then let's talk again later.

447
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,230
Okay.

448
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,810
 LaReine Group will disintegrate

449
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,740
 as well as our family. It'll rip apart...

450
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,400
 and crumble to pieces. If you take it to court, it will become a mud fight.

451
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,710
 Everyone will know the most embarrassing things about our family.

452
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,830
 We'll become a laughing stock and the butt of a joke.

453
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,900
 I don't want to live like you. I'm going to

454
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,200
 protect my family perfectly, as I have done. I am going to make sure my kids, Tae Hee and Tae Yong,

455
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,720
 grow up in a normal family, not lacking anything.

456
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,810
 Having a happy family is my life's goal.

457
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,720
The news about the Philippine factory being on strike has spread,

458
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,060
so as you can see, stock prices have been falling day after day.

459
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,890
That's enough.

460
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,280
Realize profits from short selling

461
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,260
and buy them as cheaply as possible from now on.

462
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,380
Then what happens to the LaReine apparel sale?

463
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,790
The sale of the apparel division... I'll pretend it never happened.

464
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,690
So no need to contact Silverstone anymore?

465
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,160
No. There will be a bigger account coming up soon.

466
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,720
Keep in contact with them.

467
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,220
Also... to secure management rights of the LaReine Group,

468
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,550
how much more shares do we need now?

469
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,050
If you get about 5%, there's a good chance.

470
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,290
This is Chief Director Han Seon Joo and Dr. Cha Yeong Hoon, right?

471
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:06,060
It's the other side of Hansol's Chief Director Han Seon Joo.

472
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,340
Pretending to be a perfect couple... the fake side of her while acting like she's every woman's role model.

473
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,540
I would like to reveal her true personality.

474
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,130
Is it possible to put it on air?

475
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,910
I'll try to make that happen.

476
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,010
You're sure, right?

477
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,650
Yes.

478
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,760
It's today already.

479
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,320
Yes.

480
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,890
It'll turn out according to our plans.

481
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,440
Of course.

482
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,840
Let's talk after it airs then.

483
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,930
 Hello, on Today Hot Celeb segment of Trend Journal

484
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:11,860
 we're going to introduce to you a very special people.

485
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,340
 Do you see the beautiful house over there?

486
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,020
 I was invited by the owner of that house today.

487
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,240
 Let's meet them and see who they are.

488
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,740
What's that?

489
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,390
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello.

490
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,910
 Please come in.

491
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,440
 Please come in.

492
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,870
 Wow, the entrance is so bright.

493
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:40,370
 The wannabe couple who've been covered under a veil,

494
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,510
 I'll introduce to you Han Seon Joo and Shin Myeong Seop's house for the very first time!

495
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,740
 I see a lot of artwork from the entrance.

496
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,530
 It's the interior design that showcases Han Seon Joo's artistic taste.

497
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,450
 - It's been a while. Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

498
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:59,280
 What brings you here without calling first?

499
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,880
 Producer Moon here interviewed someone...

500
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,980
 I'll tell you myself. According to the source,

501
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,660
 it's understood that you're seeing someone outside of marriage and...

502
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,280
 Me?

503
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,840
 Yes.

504
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:21,300
 A psychiatrist, Dr. Chan Yeong Hoon...

505
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,380
 He's my colleague from college and a long-time friend.

506
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,500
 It would have been irresponsible to air it without being certain,

507
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,580
 so I apologize, but I came to check facts.

508
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,630
 Who's the source?

509
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,450
 That's... not something I can tell you since I need to protect my source.

510
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,660
 I'll ask you again directly.

511
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,380
 The scandal that surrounds you... is it true?

512
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,380
 It's not.

513
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,720
 Then... why would that person lie?

514
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:31,680
 I've noticed in my life that there are people who get wrongly accused through unfortunate situations

515
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,650
 and those who try to hurt me with bad intentions.

516
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,080
 See? It's a good thing that you asked.

517
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,730
 What would you have done if this had aired?

518
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,260
 Anyway, it's a problem.

519
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,330
 We have nothing to fill the segment next week.

520
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,910
 How about this?

521
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,920
 Please come this way.

522
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,440
 Wow.

523
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,050
 While talking and having tea,

524
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,210
 we spend the most time here.

525
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,530
 The living room feels very cozy.

526
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,990
 This is her favorite space.

527
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:30,030
 But these shoes look very special. What are they?

528
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:35,160
 This pair was made and given to me by my father,

529
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,600
 and this pair was made

530
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,200
 by my husband for our wedding.

531
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,220
 You made it for her yourself?

532
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,280
 Well... yes.

533
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,090
 So pretty.

534
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,330
 It's my number one treasure.

535
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,060
 Then how about a chess game?

536
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,380
 Come home.

537
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,990
 Why suddenly?

538
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,590
 There's something you need to do.

539
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,720
 I think we need to appear on a TV show together.

540
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,260
 TV show?

541
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,090
 Someone reported that I was having an affair with Yeong Hoon.

542
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,300
 In order to stop it, I made a suggestion.

543
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,460
 Really?

544
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,900
 But...

545
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,450
 why do I have to do it?

546
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,720
 What?

547
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,340
 Why do I have to do it? It's your problem.

548
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,890
 Do it for the sake of Tae Hee and Tae Yong, at least!

549
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:03,330
 Also, there are many people within the company who are suspicious of our relationship.

550
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:05,980
 President Shin Myeong Seop...

551
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,060
 it would be helpful for your own image-making.

552
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,420
 Then lastly, tell me one thing about each other that you're proud of.

553
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,090
 I feel like such a lucky person.

554
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,120
 That I was able to meet someone like my wife.

555
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,460
 My heart still beats when I see her.

556
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,790
 How about you?

557
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:38,690
 I... feel calm when I see him instead.

558
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,630
 Should I say it's like a heavy and solid belief of a couple that is not shaken by anything?

559
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:50,530
 I trust my husband the most in the world.

560
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,180
  I can believe anything he says.

561
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,490

562
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,620

563
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,810
Did you...

564
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,250
need to show off your happiness by going this far?

565
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,010
Aren't you curious...

566
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,920
who tipped off the reporter?

567
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,400
Who was it?

568
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,410
If you're curious, go to Yoon Mi Ra and ask her directly.

569
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,680

570
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,940
Mi Ra... did you tip-off the TV station?

571
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,130
Tip-off? What do you mean?

572
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:48,670
Oh, about you and your wife being on TV? I saw it, too.

573
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,380
You look really good on TV.

574
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,350
Exactly what are you...

575
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,990
Don't you know that you acting like this makes things worse?

576
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:06,180
But... you looked so happy.

577
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:11,320
You should have pretended to be a little less happy for my sake.

578
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,610
Can't you just follow? Are you stupid?

579
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,580
What? Stupid?

580
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,680
I mean, that's because...

581
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,500
That's right, I can't!

582
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,380
No, I won't do it! No thanks!

583
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,390
Don't do it then!

584
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,700
Hurry up. Let's keep going.

585
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,250
This way. The opposite!

586
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,670
Hold on. Slower.

587
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,460
Seriously. You stepped on my foot!

588
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,530
So what? It happens.

589
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,170
Come on. Do it then.

590
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,920
What?! You said it happens!

591
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,800
Let's give it up.

592
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,950
Let's stop doing it!

593
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,640
Fine, let's stop doing it then!

594
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,590
I should just ruin her foot with my heel or something.

595
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,660
It's like a war zone.

596
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:56,640
Isn't marriage supposed to be a war without guns?

597
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,130
Oh, right. Did you hear the rumor about Han Seon Joo?

598
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,180
I'm sure it's not true, right?

599
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:07,860
I've never seen a perfect and natural couple before.

600
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,900
There's no perfect couple in this world.

601
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,900
In order to look perfect, they just pretend.

602
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,990
Come to think of it, the world is like a huge masquerade.

603
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,740
By now, Han Seon Joo's masquerade

604
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,760
is probably running towards the climax.

605
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,740
Has there been any progress in negotiations?

606
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,320
 Their requirements are becoming more ridiculous by the day.

607
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,630
Wasn't it their requirement that their wages be increased and guaranteed until retirement age?

608
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:07,250
 But they keep changing their terms at the negotiations table.

609
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,920
What do you mean?

610
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,390
 A request has been added to make all non-regular workers regular.

611
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,500
I'll call you again.

612
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,360
Goodbye.

613
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,500
Let's talk for a second.

614
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,120
I don't think it's right for you to serve as the deputy chairwoman

615
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,790
even if it's temporary.

616
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,010
What are you saying?

617
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:57,380
I acknowledge that you're capable. You've never directly been involved in company matters,

618
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,630
but you've done a lot to support me.

619
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:06,870
But there's a huge difference between helping out from behind and working on-scene.

620
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:11,150
I'm not working to get your opinion.

621
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:16,690
You've been unable to resolve the strike issue in the Philippines.

622
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,540
Do you know how much LaReine is losing daily in damages?

623
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,250
I'll take responsibility for it.

624
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,440
That's not all.

625
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,590
After you started working, the kids are suffering.

626
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,570
So what are you trying to say?

627
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,610
Go back where you belong.

628
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,300
As the children's mom

629
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,440
and as my homemaker wife. Go back to your place.

630
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,920
You have no right to say that to me.

631
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,170
What do you mean?

632
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:56,580
Oh, right. The USB that you have in your possession?

633
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:02,140
The fake USB that apparently has the evidence from the incident two years ago?

634
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,390
Don't make assumptions.

635
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,270
Reveal it.

636
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,210
Do it.

637
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:17,170
You didn't threaten me with fake evidence, did you?

638
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,260
You must have been desperate.

639
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,730
The great Han Seon Joo.

640
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,700
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

641
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,970
I'll say this for the last time.

642
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,770
Go back home.

643
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,180
And...

644
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,350
where you're sitting right now...

645
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,160
I'll sit there instead.

646
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:59,710

647
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,700
Oh, Detective Kang. Take a look at this.

648
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:14,460
There's someone the victim Yoon Mi Ra met with before the incident.

649
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,950
Huh?

650
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:30,980

651
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:38,400
♫  Tell me it's just a dream  ♫

652
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,750
♫  Even if I wake up  ♫

653
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,810
♫  I won't open my eyes  ♫

654
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:51,940
♫  Please tell me  ♫

655
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,100
♫  So I won't break this beautiful you  ♫

656
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,590
 I'll sleep at Mi Ra's tonight, and go straight to work tomorrow morning.

657
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:06,620
 This is your true color...  Dirty and hideous.

658
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,640
 Is being true to your ambitions dirty and hideous?

659
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,200
 Is there anyone who lives without ambitions? I want to take LaReine.

660
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,130
 Jeong Won...

661
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,200
 The queen has been completely isolated.

662
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,360
 Come and rest here comfortably whenever you're tired and weary.

663
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,830
 Physically cheating isn't the only way to cheat.

664
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,020
 I'm saying you can cheat emotionally, too.

665
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,090
 You've totally gone insane.

666
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,110
 Give me the deputy chairman position.

667
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,280
 You can't sit there.

668
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,550
 Han Seon Joo...

669
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,420
 - I don't want Seon Joo to get hurt. 
 - I believe I've done as much as I can.

670
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,230
 It would be best for you to not do it.
