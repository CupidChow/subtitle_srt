1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,530
- What's going on, Mom? 
 - Mom, who are these people?

2
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,860
Honey.

3
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,370
Take the kids away.

4
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,630
I'll be back soon.

5
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,580
I mean, he's the one who cheated.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,050
So why does the innocent

7
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,780
spouse have to get hurt?

8
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,310
The bastard and the wench are the ones who were out there having fun, so why the hell...

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,170
does the spouse have to be put through such pain?

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,390
If the beautiful and brilliant queen's show window is

11
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,640
suddenly attacked by an intruder,

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,400
even a solid castle will collapse in an instant.

13
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,920
By chance, do you have a religion?

14
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Han Seon Joo's absolute religion, her perfect family,

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,510
shattered completely into pieces.

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,280
How will she handle that?

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,430

18
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,540
Grandma, Happy Birthday.

19
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,150
Thank you.

20
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,210
Happy Birthday, Mother.

21
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,920
Happy Birthday, Chairwoman.

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,190
Thank you.

23
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Happy Birthday, Chairwoman.

24
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,670
Aunt, you made all this?

25
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,500
Actually, your uncle made most of it. I just assisted.

26
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,930
You can cook, Uncle?

27
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,980
I am very skilled with my hands.

28
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,520
Try some. I attempted to copy it, but I don't know if it'll suit your taste.

29
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,740
It looks pretty good for trying to copy.

30
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,590
Let's eat up.

31
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,970
Thank you.

32
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,650
Please eat a lot, Chairwoman.

33
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,890
You too.

34
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,550
Seon Joo... you eat a lot, too.

35
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,870
Okay.

36
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,900
President Shin, enjoy it as well.

37
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,720
Oh, you too.

38
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,170
Thank you.

39
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,980
How long are you going to keep going?

40
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,130
Your end goal isn't Jeong Won.

41
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,680
I thought about why you would

42
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,750
suddenly approve of us getting married.

43
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,290
You're waiting for me to give up on my own

44
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,950
and turn away, right?

45
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,600
But it's too bad.

46
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,450
I don't think things will turn out the way you hope.

47
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,690
Do you not like that girl, Mi Ra?

48
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,460
You've had a dark expression the whole time we have been here.

49
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,150
No. I don't know her that well yet.

50
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,120
Even if you don't like her, this time,

51
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,320
you should let it be.

52
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,550
Jeong Won came into our family when he was five years old,

53
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,630
so it's been over 30 years already.

54
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,830
It's the first time I've seen him so happy.

55
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,010
Excuse me.

56
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,260
Yes, Secretary Kang.

57
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,090
What's going on with the Director Choi issue?

58
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,880
What? Don't you know that he's the Chairwoman's closest ally?

59
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,360
He's the key!

60
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,050
Push back everything else. Work on Director Choi first.

61
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,550
Okay.

62
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,250
I should go to bed now.

63
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,340
Good night.

64
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,640
Good night.

65
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,510
You guys should go to bed, too. It's late.

66
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,630
What? Already?

67
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,390
Yeah. We haven't come here to have fun in a long time.

68
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,470
Let them play a little longer.

69
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,550
Tae Yong, do you want to play another round of chess?

70
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,020
Mom, I'll go to bed after one more round.

71
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,310
It's late. Go to bed.

72
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,980
I guess we should call it a night.

73
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,220
Let's clean up and go to our rooms.

74
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,370
You must be tired.

75
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,100
 This time, you should let it be.

76
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,500
 It's the first time I've seen him so happy.

77
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,220
 President Shin, enjoy it as well.

78
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,770
 You, too.

79
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,320
Must you really...

80
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,180
provoke me like this?

81
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,540
What did I do?

82
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,780
If you keep doing this,

83
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,040
it'll only become harder for you.

84
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,200
For you, I can do anything.

85
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,900
But how long do I have to hold back?

86
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,850
Please don't leave me like this.

87
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,000
But you know that, in the end,

88
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,330
you'll be the one next to me.

89
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,310
I longed for your breath...

90
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,170
Me too.

91
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
Seon Joo!

92
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,430
Hold on. Seon Joo!

93
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,030
Honey, wait. Wait!

94
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,660
Honey! Honey! Honey!

95
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,830
I'm sorry...

96
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,260
I know I have no excuse.

97
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,950
I know that, but...

98
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,110
I must have gone crazy for a second.

99
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,470
It was a family trip.

100
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,010
Our kids were just 5 minutes away.

101
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,230
But in that situation...

102
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,780
how could you...

103
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,050
How dare you call yourselves human?

104
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,030
Get out.

105
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,460
Seon Joo.

106
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,210
Go stay at a hotel. I'll call you when I'm done organizing my thoughts.

107
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,710
What can I do?

108
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,850
Just tell me.

109
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,730
Whatever you want,

110
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,740
whatever you tell me to do,

111
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,910
I'll do everything.

112
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,620
Whatever...

113
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,350
I want?

114
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,960
Go to hell then.

115
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,930
You're back?

116
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,430
We're back.

117
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,490
Why did you and dad come back first? Is something wrong?

118
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,220
Did you have a secret date without us in the middle of the night?

119
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,350
Since you had a lot of fun, you should go do your homework.

120
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,080
Go upstairs then.

121
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,390
Thank you.

122
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,040
You drove Mom back safely, right?

123
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
Of course.

124
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,370
But... I was surprised when I saw the text from Myeong Seop.

125
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,080
Did something happen all of a sudden?

126
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,740
Why would you leave without saying anything?

127
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,560
I had a slight cold.

128
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,390
Where's Mi Ra?

129
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,530
She's at home. She said she was tired, so I told her to go home first.

130
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,930
Yes.

131
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,340
 What's wrong?

132
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,910
Why did you leave first without a word?

133
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,890
I had a slight cold. Sorry.

134
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,910
How bad do you feel?

135
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,450
Mom, I was about to go out.

136
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,930
I'll call you later.

137
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,580
Okay.

138
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,310
What are you talking about right now?

139
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,720
Who made the decision to fire President Son?

140
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,370
Since the founding of our company,

141
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,470
he and I shared thoughts and experienced life together!

142
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,430
But you know very well that he made a huge mistake

143
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,610
during the bid for the jewelry gemstones.

144
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,860
The owner of the gemstone factory is an old classmate of his.

145
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,400
It was a pure coincidence, not corruption!

146
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,330
It was a simple misunderstanding.

147
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,670
A simple misunderstanding can't happen when operating a company.

148
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,890
If LaReine can't be reborn through innovation and reform,

149
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,830
there will be no future.

150
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,060
Especially, the jewelry division is sensitive to trends.

151
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,250
Lee Joon Sang who is in charge of that division

152
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,060
is a capable and talented person.

153
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,690
But you even changed our law firm partner. Was that also

154
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,210
to be reborn through innovation and reform? Huh?

155
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,160
Ahn Do Hyeok of the Daeha Law Firm, is a former prosecutor

156
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,540
at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.  Whether through academic ties or personal connections,

157
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,600
I believe he has a great influence within the prosecution,

158
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,030
and I'm confident that he's someone who can

159
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,730
support LaReine externally.

160
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,550
If you're going to just swap out everyone like that,

161
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,620
why not me, too?

162
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,850
What do you mean? You are LaReine itself.

163
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,160
I have never imagined LaReine without you at the helm.

164
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,730
You can leave now.

165
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm back.

166
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,540
Are you worried about something?

167
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,690
Why would I be worried when you're next to me?

168
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,050
I'm also really happy.

169
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,720
- I'm not getting divorced. 
 - No, you will.

170
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,620
Not only divorce,

171
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,080
but you'll have to give up your seat as the head of LaReine Group.

172
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,490
LaReine would have never grown this much without my efforts.

173
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,330
I'm no longer someone who can be fired

174
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,670
just because you or your mother says so.

175
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,300
You're finally showing your true colors, Shin Myeong Seop.

176
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,090
Our family and my position,

177
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,520
I will never give up.

178
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,140
Too bad then. I'll have to take it to court.

179
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
It'll disintegrate.

180
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,900
What?

181
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,510
LaReine Group as well as our family.

182
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,680
It'll rip apart and crumble to pieces.

183
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,810
If you take it to court, it'll become a mud fight.

184
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,070
Everyone will know the most embarrassing things about our family.

185
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,990
We'll become a laughing stock and the butt of a joke.

186
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,620
People will probably say...

187
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,070
Han Seon Joo, who pretended to have the happiest life,

188
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,030
in the end had a show window life, too.

189
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,020
That it was just a lie wrapped up in pretentiousness.

190
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,240
People mocking and making fun of you...

191
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,850
is that what you want?

192
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,820
I resent...

193
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,390
having loved someone like you.

194
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,600
 Sis, you know what?

195
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,020
 These Victoria shoes were designed by Mi Ra.

196
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,790
 Myeong Seop told me that when she was working at Yeongwon Leather,

197
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,990
 she designed them.

198
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,820
You told me Mi Ra used to work at Yeongwon Leather.

199
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,040
Tell me everything you know.

200
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,780
Yeongwon Leather was founded by her parents.

201
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,330
They died from an accident,

202
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,090
and I heard that now her uncle has taken over.

203
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,380
She's the daughter of Yeongwon Leather's founders?

204
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,570
Mi Ra said she worked there until two years ago.

205
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,380
That's when she designed the Victoria shoes, too.

206
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,210
Mi Ra was working there until two years ago?

207
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,650
Why did you want to know that all of a sudden?

208
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,400
I was just curious.

209
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,330
I'm home.

210
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,430
What did you talk about with Seon Joo?

211
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,200
I saw you going into her place.

212
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,700
Well, she asked if we

213
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,130
needed anything for when we get married.

214
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,640
I told her I'd discuss it with you.

215
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,630
I see.

216
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,770
Let me change first.

217
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,200
Sorry. I couldn't be of more help to you.

218
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't say that.

219
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,630
I'm of the age to retire anyway.

220
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,830
It's not a big deal leaving a few months sooner.

221
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,480
Anyway, is the Chairwoman well?

222
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,140
Yes.

223
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,670
I'm sure you didn't come because you were curious about how I was doing...

224
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,300
Well...

225
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:22,500
do you remember the incident in China two years ago?

226
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,810
Yes, of course I do.

227
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,300
Since I was the head of the shoemaking division I could never forget.

228
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,240
 Not only divorce, but you'll have to give up your seat as the head of LaReine Group.

229
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,080
Over my dead body.

230
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,830
What happened with President Choi?

231
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,430
Good.

232
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,160
Is it time to show my last hand?

233
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,620
When is Dad coming home?

234
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,420
He's busy because of a new project.

235
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,030
Are you a kid? Looking for Dad.

236
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,240
I wonder what he's doing right now.

237
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,270
Kids, how would you feel

238
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,150
if Dad wasn't around?

239
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,320
What do you mean by that?

240
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,710
Nothing much. I was curious.

241
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,030
How would it feel if Dad wasn't around?

242
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,940
I've never thought about it.

243
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,300
Me neither. It's ridiculous.

244
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,240
Ridiculous?

245
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,410
Of course! Goes without saying.

246
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,770
How's work?

247
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:29,500
Yeah. I'm still getting used to it.

248
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,800
But... why did you call me out of the blue?

249
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:44,920
Are you... really going to get married?

250
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,550
Did my sister say something?

251
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,130
I don't care what she says.

252
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,760
Who she lived with in the past

253
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,120
or what she did...

254
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,770
It's all in the past.

255
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,240
Right. But when it comes to marriage,

256
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,630
it's not that simple.

257
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,370
I thought you and my sister of all people would

258
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,820
understand me and cheer me on.

259
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,440
Oh, you're here.

260
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,430
Let me introduce you. This is my fiancée, Yoon Mi Ra.

261
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,480
This is Yeong Hoon.

262
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,250
Hello.

263
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,770
Hello.

264
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,510
Why didn't you get married to Seon Joo?

265
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,660
I hoped... for Seon Joo to be happy.

266
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:24,650
If Seon Joo was unhappy, would you go for her again?

267
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,470
Mi Ra...

268
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,240
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

269
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,570

270
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,120
Why did we come here?

271
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,730
This is where I chose my wedding dress when I got married.

272
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,980
So?

273
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,040
I want to help you with your wedding dress.

274
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,650
What strategy is this?

275
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,620
Strategy, you say? How crude.

276
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,730
Choose a dress, something special that Jeong Won will like.

277
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,640
May we have the room to ourselves for a moment?

278
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,320
My sister-in-law is so pretty.

279
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,030
Why are you being like this?

280
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,080
While knowing that Myeong Seop and I are crossing the line again.

281
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,040
A thing called habit is quite scary.

282
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,600
Now, I'm not even surprised.

283
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:38,040
Since you decided to get married to Jeong Won, you should do it, no?

284
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,580
If you become Jeong Won's wife, you'll be caught in a trap.

285
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,600
Sinking into a pit deeper and deeper

286
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,240
that gets harder to escape from.

287
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,450
Are you ready?

288
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,510
Make a choice.

289
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,740
Voluntarily entering the trap that you set for the rest of your life,

290
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,820
living quietly playing the role of Jeong Won's wife,

291
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,080
or...

292
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,140
having what you want.

293
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,090
You look really...

294
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,260
pretty.

295
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,870
- Wow! You all worked hard! 
 - Thank you!

296
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,320
- The atmosphere in today's class was so good! 
 - It was.

297
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,720
These days... I don't see Han Seon Joo's couple very much, did they quit?

298
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,440
That's probably not it. She's very busy preparing for her younger brother's wedding.

299
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,590
Ah, I see.

300
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,650
Are they really getting married?

301
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,400
They said they are.

302
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,800
For the gift, we should prepare something big, shouldn't we?

303
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,750
Of course. After asking what they need,

304
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,470
don't be stingy, get something big.

305
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,340
You prepare a gift, too.

306
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,350
A gift? We can just gift them money. It's not like he's my younger brother.

307
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,620
They're not just neighborhood residents now, they're our bosses!

308
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,140
I will give them a lot of congratulatory money.

309
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,190
I don't think there will be a need for that...

310
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,180
Ah, I'm hungry. What would you like to eat, honey?

311
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,950
Your love!

312
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,310
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

313
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,160
I don't know how this will sound to you,

314
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:19,930
but I really... thought of you as my real younger sister.

315
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,460
This is sincere.

316
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,460
- I know. 
 - If we hadn't been tied up in this kind of fate,

317
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,760
how happy would we have been?

318
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,460
I feel the same way about that.

319
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,780
If not for this kind of fate, we would have been really happy.

320
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,220
Let's make a deal.

321
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,710
Since I'll give you what you want, you give me what I want.

322
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,790
What is it that I want?

323
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,260
Shin Myeong Seop, of course.

324
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,190
I'll give him to you, Shin Myeong Seop.

325
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,150
There are only two things that I want.

326
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,650
Mi Ra.

327
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,600
You came?

328
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,840
The first one, make it so that my brother Jeong Won can give up on you.

329
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:03,160
Shall we... go get some fresh air?

330
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,290
Right now?

331
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,470
Mi Ra.

332
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,890
I... kept walking around holding the ring.

333
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,870
I intended to propose in a cool way,

334
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,990
but the time seems to be now.

335
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,940
Jeong Won...

336
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,740
Yoon Mi Ra,

337
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,620
will you marry me?

338
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,460
If we quietly divorce,

339
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,150
and you obediently step down from the executive seat, everything will be peaceful.

340
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,490
But if you don't, everything will become a bloodbath.

341
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,380
I'm afraid.

342
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,270
Is this a declaration of war?

343
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,030
No.

344
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,940
My last favor to you is my last showing of mercy.

345
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,070
If I were to go to war,

346
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,920
would I not bring any weapons?

347
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,680
All right.

348
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,540
Let's give it a shot.

349
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,880
Let's see who wins.

350
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,790
If you sincerely sought atonement even one time,

351
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,750
I would have tried to understand you to the end.

352
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,650
But as expected,

353
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,570
we could only come this far.

354
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm happy.

355
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,100
I'll be good to you.

356
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,310
To make it so that you never regret choosing me,

357
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,170
I'll really do my best.

358
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,630
The ring is really pretty.

359
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,030
But...

360
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,130
I can't accept it.

361
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,790
I have someone who I love.

362
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,780
More than my life,

363
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,820
I love that person.

364
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,280
That's me, though.

365
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,580
I approached you because of that person.

366
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,930
Strategically, from the beginning.

367
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,500
Stop joking.

368
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,360
It's not a joke. I used you.

369
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,920
In order to get the person I love, I used you.

370
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,410
Let's end things here.

371
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,880
As for apologies

372
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,210
and asking for forgiveness,

373
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,880
I won't be doing that.

374
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,140
Don't do this to me.

375
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,500
You need to get it together.

376
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,700
Mi Ra, please.

377
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,490
I have never loved you once.

378
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,080
Should I say it again?

379
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,960
Han Jeong Won!

380
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,280
I don't love you.

381
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,630
 I'm going to marry Mi Ra.

382
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,860
 That woman, Yoon Mi Ra,

383
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,690
 was a mistress in a relationship with a married man.

384
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,120
Don't tell me...

385
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,030
Don't tell me that the person you love...

386
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,220
is my brother-in-law.

387
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,920
I'm asking you

388
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,390
if that person is Shin Myeong Seop!

389
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,030
How could this happen?

390
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,310
Does this make any sense?

391
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,980
How could you...

392
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,980
How could you do this to me?

393
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,560
How could you!

394
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,660
I definitely won't let this slide.

395
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,660
Not for you, or Shin Myeong Seop.

396
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,430
Sis—

397
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,850
Are you okay?

398
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,210
I'm okay.

399
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,710
Don't cry.

400
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,120
All that time...

401
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,740
The happiness you gave me for all that time,

402
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,340
will cover the cost of you ripping up my heart.

403
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,940
But...

404
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,640
don't even think about messing with my sister.

405
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,750
Even though it's you, I won't be able to forgive you.

406
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,760
If you touch Han Seon Joo again,

407
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,610
I'll kill you.

408
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,330
Okay, I got it.

409
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,860
Brother-in-Law.

410
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,800
What's wrong with your hand? Did you get hurt?

411
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,190
Yes, I got hurt.

412
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,230
You should be careful.

413
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,800
It turns out that being careful on your own, can still lead to injury.

414
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,970
All right then, I'll see you.

415
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,260
You too, Brother-in-Law,

416
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,930
be careful.

417
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,120
Executive Director Shin, I thought you were very busy.

418
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,320
It would be good to avoid doing useless things.

419
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,850
No matter what anyone says, our LaReine

420
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,180
is the company of Chairwoman Kim Kang Im.

421
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,920
Director Choi,

422
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:32,160
you've been at the chairwoman's side for over 20 years, correct?

423
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,290
As a founding member.

424
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:41,390
Yes. And for the next 30, 40 years in the future,

425
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,200
I will protect her side.

426
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,440
What an impressive sense of loyalty.

427
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,690
I'm curious,

428
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,750
as to whether

429
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,470
you can retain that sense of loyalty.

430
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,270
Your son is in the United States, correct?

431
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,650
He really lives being quite the spectacle,

432
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,240
even doing drugs.

433
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,460
Whether you'll stay at the chairwoman's side,

434
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,360
or come to mine,

435
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,480
you don't really need to weigh the options, do you?

436
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,840
 Two years ago, there was an incident involving LaReine's label being stuck on fake shoes,

437
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,500
 that were circulated throughout China in large quantities.

438
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,670
 Through an internal investigation,

439
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,790
 it was revealed that the fakes were coming from a subcontractor by the name of Yeongwon Leather.

440
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,990
 You remember, right?

441
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,930
 It seems that the incident may be connected to Shin Myeong Seop.

442
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,490
 Find the evidence for me.

443
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,000
 This is the condition of my second request.

444
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,330
 You're asking me... to find that evidence for you?

445
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:45,590
 Two years ago, you worked as an accountant at Yeongwon Leather.

446
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:48,190
 The evidence shouldn't be too hard to find.

447
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:52,980
 Myeong Seop covets LaReine Group quite a bit.

448
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,340
 If I were to ruin that, he would leave me. But...

449
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,790
 you're asking me to help you with sending him out?

450
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,270
 Correct, Shin Myeong Seop

451
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,720
 has a large amount of ambition towards LaReine.

452
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,000
 So as long as he's involved with LaReine, he will never divorce me.

453
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,110
 He is the one who won't divorce, not me.

454
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,830
 If you give me that evidence,

455
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,950
 I will help you

456
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,710
 to grow Yeongwon Leather to Yeongwon Trading Company.

457
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,190
 Just like alimony,

458
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,960
 I will give you enough money to raise Yeongwon Trading Company.

459
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,740
 You and Shin Myeong Seop together.

460
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:44,960
 Give it a shot and grow Yeongwon Leather, which was passed on by your parents, to Yeongwon Trading Company.

461
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:52,770
 With this on the table, I don't think my conditions are too bad.

462
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,740
What is this? Why are you here?

463
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,890
Should I help you earn money, Uncle?

464
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,680
Talking shit. How can you?

465
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,550
About that Chinese counterfeiting incident from 2 years ago... the broker records from China's side are still available, right?

466
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,540
Of course, they're all gone. That was so long ago.

467
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,020
That's a shame. Somebody wanted to buy them.

468
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,630
What?

469
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:44,780
They said they'd give you however much you wanted. Do you really not have them?

470
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,400
How much will they give me?

471
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,350
 You know right? In the end

472
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,880
 you will remain next to me.

473
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,750
 That man will never divorce me as long as he's at LaReine.

474
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,930
This is the transaction book we used from two years ago

475
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,600
to send the products made at our factory to China.

476
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,780
Keep up your promise to divorce.

477
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,730
Of course.

478
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:14,130
And your promise to grow Yeongwon Leather into Yeongwon Trading Company.

479
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,620
Don't worry. I will keep up my promise, for sure.

480
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,580

481
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,630
 Everything is ready.

482
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:23,320
Why did you just leave without a word on my birthday?

483
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,610
And you, why did you cancel your wedding?

484
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,030
What is going on? Tell me.

485
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,820
What's with the sudden emergency board meeting?

486
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,310
That's what I'm saying.

487
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,690
Tell me exactly what's going on.

488
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,800
Seon Joo, exactly what...

489
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,660
Hello.

490
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,270
Yes, this is she.

491
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,770
Where is it?

492
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,030
What is the matter?

493
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,380
Okay.

494
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,430
All right.

495
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,180
What is it?

496
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,930
What's the call about?

497
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:58,070
Mom... Father...

498
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,620
Father is...

499
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,750
They said that Father passed away.

500
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,210
The chairwoman had a personal situation

501
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,090
so she couldn't attend today's meeting.

502
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,370
Got it.

503
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,710
Executive Director Shin! Why have you suddenly called an emergency board meeting?

504
00:58:54,550 --> 00:59:01,020
Our company, LaReine, has now put forth renewal and innovation as our new value.

505
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,910
To achieve that, we must reorganize the business structure within the group,

506
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:10,590
and turn our eyes to a competitive new material business of the future.

507
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:22,980
The first part is... I would like to suggest the sale of LaReine Apparel.

508
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,690
Sale?

509
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,910
You're saying to rip LaReine Apparel apart from the group?

510
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,160
Using the capital gained through the sale of LaReine Apparel,

511
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,700
I plan on investing in a new material business of the future.

512
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:59,510
 It appears that following the establishment of LaReine Apparel, you were in possession of a lot of personal shares.

513
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,770
 As for the remaining 30 percent of stocks owned by LaReine...

514
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,900
 Did you find somewhere they can be sold?

515
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:14,100
 There's a famous black hedge fund called "Silverstone" based in Hong Kong.

516
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,280
 According to our resources, they're interested in us.

517
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,260
 May I ask, why are you selling shares from the LaReine parent company?

518
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,040
 I'm going to buy them up again.

519
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,240
 Excuse me?

520
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:35,040
 I will make it all mine, LaReine Apparel.

521
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,940
 But in order to sell,

522
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,410
 you need to legally receive a majority vote from the board of directors.

523
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:49,500
 The majority... has already been obtained.

524
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,600
Director Choi! Are you just going to sit and let this happen?

525
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,430
Please say something.

526
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,170
Calm down, everyone.

527
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:08,400
First, let's listen to his plan.

528
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,740
What the hell are you saying?

529
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,350
End the meeting! When the Chairwoman is not present,

530
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,340
we cannot decide amongst ourselves.

531
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:40,220
The Chairwoman is absent, but Shin Myeong Seop, our Executive Director, is here.

532
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,580
We can still vote on the item with the authority of the present board members.

533
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:50,170
I am opposed to the sale of the apparel business, as well as having an interest in the new material business!

534
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:51,690
-  We oppose! 
- We oppose!

535
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,700
 We oppose...

536
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,750
Let's read the global trends a bit.

537
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:03,230
Are we going to live and die like a frog trapped in a well?

538
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,440
Don't you dare...

539
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,150
President Shin Myeong Seop, please stop.

540
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:04,950

541
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:33,470
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

542
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:40,410
♫  for you to see I’m no company  ♫

543
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:48,210
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

544
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:56,200
♫  I guess you don't know that. I guess how I feel  ♫

545
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,580
♫  I bet my love can't compensate no more  ♫

546
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:09,170
♫  I think all that’s in my head has been replaced somehow  ♫

547
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,160

♫  My god I feel the open wounds come back to me  ♫

548
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,450
 You are the reason why Dad is not home, right?

549
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,820
 What wrong did he do to you?

550
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,140
 Why did you hit Jeon Gook?

551
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:21,540
 He lied to me that my parents are getting a divorce.

552
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,190
 I was so annoyed and scared.

553
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,130
 Is this what you want?

554
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,690
 If you continue like this, you might regret it later.

555
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:35,240
 Would I regret anything more than the fact that you are my husband?

556
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,100
 - Come back home. 
 - Now it's time for you to keep your promise.

557
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,870
 Divorce Shin Myeong Seop.

558
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:44,970
 I gave you a chance, but you ruined it.

559
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,970
 Blame it on your misguided love.

560
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:53,700
 If your statement in this interview were true, would you have any evidence to prove it?

561
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,460
 Yes, I do have evidence.

562
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:02,880
♫  I left my heart...  ♫
