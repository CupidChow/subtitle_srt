1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,930

2
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,600
Get the list of all the guests who were present,

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,220
and gather up all the CCTV and black boxes from parked vehicles

4
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,770
- within the complex. 
 - Yes, Sir.

5
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,890
The day that should have been their happiest became their hell.

6
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,970
There must have been a lot of people around, but the crime was boldly carried out.

7
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,970
There are as many who loathe and have secrets as there are people.

8
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,890
I thought they were especially fated by the heavens.

9
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,720
It turns out it was an ill-fated destiny where they should have never met each other. A horrible one at that.

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,480
You know how if you button up the first one wrong,

11
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,310
it messes up the entire fit of the shirt?

12
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,240
Regardless of fate, it was wrong from the start.

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,290
Beautiful and splendid show window...

14
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,050
It's open for everyone to see, but once the spotlights go out and the curtains are drawn,

15
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,280
no one can ever know

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,760
what's really going on.

17
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,060

18
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,490

19
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,750
Wasn't it an excellent choice?

20
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,970
It'll be comfortable for you, and I can see you more often, too.

21
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,670
I like that it gives us more time.

22
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,000
Your house is that townhouse over there, right?

23
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,010
I should get going.

24
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,570
See you later.

25
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,280

26
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,870
Seon Joo.

27
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,440
Do you get treatment somewhere else besides here?

28
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,900
Right?

29
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,500
Lately, I'm worried because I keep gaining in my midsection.

30
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,290
How do you maintain your weight?

31
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,130
Seriously... what do you mean?

32
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,260
She doesn't need to maintain anything!

33
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,330
There's a reason why her husband treats her like a queen.

34
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,010
Who's that?

35
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,070
I've never seen her before.

36
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,000
Excuse me for a minute.

37
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,470
Mi Ra?

38
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,150
Han Seon Joo?

39
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,510
I can't believe I'm running into you here. It's so nice to see you again.

40
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I guess we were fated after all.

41
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,820
You're right, a special fate.

42
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,500
Last time, I made so many mistakes.

43
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,480
Oh, right! Let me pay you back.

44
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,060
- Oh, it's fine. 
 - Still. I won't feel comfortable, otherwise.

45
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,440
Then instead, buy me dinner when you have time.

46
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,930
Should I do that then?

47
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay. I'll take you somewhere really nice.

48
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,950
I won't forget to bring my wallet on that day.

49
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,390
Okay.

50
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,650
As you can see, the current sales numbers

51
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,810
have shot up rapidly compared to the past numbers.

52
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,960
After the last show launch, our fashion brand Victoria,

53
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,060
has been established as our representative brand

54
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,280
even though many were concerned.

55
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,130
Executive Director Shin.

56
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,570
Yes.

57
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,150
Does this seem easy to you?

58
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,750
The path to this place right here

59
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,130
is so difficult and trying, that every time you take another step up,

60
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,990
your knees feel like they're going to buckle.

61
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,230
Established? There's a long way to go still.

62
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,590
Don't be arrogant,

63
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,940
and learn first to be humble and modest.

64
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,990
Yes, Ma'am.

65
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
Look at your amazing skin.

66
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,980
- So pretty! 
 - You look pretty.

67
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,170
It's nice to be young.

68
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,590
How long have you been a member of Queen's Club?

69
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,170
- I registered last week. 
 - Where do you live?

70
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,160
I have in an apartment nearby.

71
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,770
I moved in last week.

72
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,470
That's so great.

73
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,820
Let's meet up often then.

74
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,450
Hold on...

75
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,080
Isn't that a limited edition bag?

76
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,460
- Y-Yes. 
 - Really? Let me see.

77
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,780
- Show us. 
 - It is!

78
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,310
Really?

79
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,430
It's the same one I have. Where did you get it?

80
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,330
Paris? Milan?

81
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,700
I bought mine in Paris.

82
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,260
Did you get it at a luxury store on the Champs-Élysées?

83
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,810
I got it as a gift from my boyfriend.

84
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,980
Are you free today? Do you want to have dinner together?

85
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,630
I still need to unpack and organize, since I just moved.

86
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,850
I don't think I can today.

87
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,470
Okay then. Let's meet next time.

88
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,330
Since we'll keep running into each other from now on.

89
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,130

90
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,020
Jeong Won! You usually never call? What's the occasion?

91
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,060
What are you talking about right now?!

92
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,120
 It looks like there was a double contract.

93
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,810
The Shanghai department store brought it up to us,

94
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,990
- and notified us that they want to reconsider us getting into– 
 - Not that.

95
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,540
What's the actual loss due to the issue?

96
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,780
The company that was double contracted

97
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,570
is a rival to the Shanghai department store.

98
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,430
Yes, Chief Han. How is it going over there?

99
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,580
Okay. I'm going into the meeting, so hurry it up.

100
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,630
Connect the call by video, too.

101
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,180
 Executive Director Shin, what exactly is going on?

102
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,100
 Double contract?

103
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,360
 You told me you signed an exclusive contract with us.

104
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,090
 If this happens,

105
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,360
 we will have to get rid of all the marketing concepts and promotions

106
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,700
 that our department store has advertised.

107
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,310
 This is a huge loss for us!

108
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,500
I know what your concern is.

109
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,560
The representative of the leather company in Milan,

110
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,690
Chairman Carlos Peguero is on with us

111
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,490
via video call,

112
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,920
so please speak to him directly.

113
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,670
All right.

114
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,260
 He says that the double contract issue

115
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,210
 was a mistake that

116
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,860
 the chairman's son made.

117
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,820
Therefore, he believes

118
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,280
Milan is fully responsible

119
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,210
 and promises to

120
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,700
 take care of the issue completely.

121
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,850
It got resolved.

122
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,830
The Milan company will take full responsibility

123
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,030
over all the issues with the double contract.

124
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,970
We also resolved all misunderstandings with the Shanghai department store.

125
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,020
Chief Han played a huge role in this matter.

126
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,580
He went to see the honorary President Carlos in person

127
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,750
and made a negotiation.

128
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,610
Negotiation?

129
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,840
He had those kinds of guts?

130
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,910
Thank you!

131
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,140
- Jeong Won. 
 - Did everything get wrapped up well, Executive Director?

132
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,030
Don't call me Executive Director.

133
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,400
Don't be so formal.

134
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,250
 You worked hard, brother-in-law.

135
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,130
I always felt this way,

136
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,840
but you're the best.

137
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,500
You're the one who worked hard. Great job.

138
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,800
The chairwoman complimented you, too.

139
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
 Really?

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,870
She really complimented me?

141
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,320
 Of course!

142
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,590
Oh, when are you coming back to Korea?

143
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,320
Your sister really misses you.

144
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,930
 I'm actually thinking about returning soon.

145
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,270
You're welcome anytime.

146
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,520
When you come,

147
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,250
don't forget to bring the wine your sister loves.

148
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,450
You're still the same. Only caring about my sister.

149
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,200
Start caring for yourself, too.

150
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,050
I'll see you soon then.

151
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,370
-  Yes, Sir.  
 - Secretary Kang.

152
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,490
Tell Driver Yang to go home early.

153
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,490
- But leave the car. 
 -  Yes, Sir.

154
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,710
The scheduling teacher is picking me up from tomorrow, right?

155
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,580
She'll handle everything for you and Tae Yong.

156
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,900

157
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,250
Jeong Won!

158
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,660
Sister, like you said,

159
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,980
it was a good thing I met with Chairman Carlos first.

160
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,590
It's because you did well that everything got resolved.

161
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,890
- Uncle, ciao! 
  - Oh, my niece!

162
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,530
 Hi, hi!

163
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,410
He said, "Hi, hi".

164
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,030
Wow, that's so dated.

165
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,100
 Sister, I think I'm flying back next month sometime.

166
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,660
Really? That's great.

167
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,720
Let's go see musicals and exhibitions.

168
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,310
There are so many things we need to do!

169
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,230
I guess I'll hang out with you instead of working.

170
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,670
 I'd be happy if you did!

171
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,480
Anyway, take care and get here quickly!

172
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,040
 Okay.

173
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,030
 - My niece, too, see you soon!  
 - Okay.

174
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,090
- Uncle, ciao! 
  - Ciao.

175
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,110
Bye!

176
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,510
I'm glad he's coming back.

177
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,600
By the way, Mom,

178
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,480
- Hye Rim isn't coming to school or the academy these days. 
 - Really?

179
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,150
The kids were saying that she's smoking and drinking

180
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,200
and hanging out with bad kids.

181
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,990
- I was crazy surprised. 
 - Crazy surprised?

182
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,240
I told you not to talk in slang.

183
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,890
All the kids say it.

184
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,580
- I'll get going. 
 - Study hard!

185
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,350

186
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,860

189
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,770
What's making you smile so much?

190
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,910
Isn't it hard

191
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,810
teaching those kids?

192
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,230
When I'm with them,

193
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,090
I feel the happiest and most comfortable.

194
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,420
What about when you're with me, then?

195
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,860
When I'm with you, Honey,

196
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,530
I become passionate.

197
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,960
Okay, I got it.

198
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,710
Okay, that's enough.

199
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,020
Okay, okay.

200
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,670
But... do you

201
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,680
have to use social media?

202
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,430
Why?

203
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,040
Are you worried I'll post something about you?

204
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,210
"The great LaReine Group's executive director, Shin Myeong Seop, is my boyfriend."

205
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,950
Are you worried I'll tell it to the whole world?

206
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,700
Don't worry.

207
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,880
I don't want people knowing about my private life either.

208
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,410
I only post the academy students' art

209
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,310
so their parents can see.

210
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,290
That's fine then.

211
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,930
Aren't you Hye Rim?

212
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,950
Are you okay? Did you get hurt at all?

213
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,990
Get in the car. Let's go to the hospital.

214
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,050
I'm not hurt.

215
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,590
The car didn't even touch me.

216
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,610
Have you been... drinking?

217
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,240
Can you give me a ride?

218
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,400
Hold on.

219
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,700
Who would smell like lotion when they're coming home from work?

220
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,020
Wouldn't that be odd?

221
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,090
Don't use the lotion.

222
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,790
That's true.

223
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,460
I just saved your life.

224
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,100
You're my savior.

225
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,680
What should I do

226
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
for my savior?

227
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
I'm hungry.

228
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,650
I want to eat something you cook.

229
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,710
How is it?

230
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,450
I love the pasta that you

231
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,000
make for me the most.

232
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,220
Go inside.

233
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,760
Help!

234
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,190
Help me!

235
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,830
Ma'am.

236
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,370
Ma'am, help!

237
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,290
Hye Rim! What happened?

238
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,210
Help.

239
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,860
What is it?

240
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,930
Hye Rim's mom!

241
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,180
Oh no!

242
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,900
Hello? Please get here quick!

243
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,410
There's a musical I want to see. Do you want to go with me?

244
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
You promised not to do this.

245
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,540
I'm asking to watch just one musical together. You can't even do that?

246
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,840
There are a lot of people who would recognize me when I'm out.

247
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,690
When you're that careful,

248
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,060
why did you move me over here?

249
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,780
That's because I missed you a lot. You didn't know?

250
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,850
I did.

251
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,370
As long as we're careful, nothing will go wrong.

252
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,290
Careful...

253
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,740
What if ... I'm not careful?

254
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,060
You're a smart woman.

255
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,300
That's true.

256
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,930
I don't want anything bad happening to you.

257
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,960
It's so nice...

258
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,430
having you close by.

259
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,330
Whenever I miss you, I can see you.

260
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,900
Hold on a second.

261
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,110
Yes, Honey.

262
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,050
Where are you?

263
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,210
- When are you coming home? 
 - I'm almost there.

264
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,370
That's terrible.

265
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,970
You're okay, though, right?

266
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,020
Okay. I'll be right there.

267
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,520
 Yeon Joo!

268
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,250
 Yeon Joo!

269
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,410
 Yeon Joo!

270
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,120
 Please wake up, Yeon Joo!

271
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,070
 Yeon Joo!

272
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,190
Honey.

273
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,300
You woke up because of me. Sorry.

274
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,030
You must have been really shocked because of Hye Rim's mom.

275
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,250
You can't even sleep.

276
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,760
It's not our concern. Don't worry too much.

277
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,620
It feels personal.

278
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,100
Because it reminds you of your sister?

279
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,130
I thought I forgot everything,

280
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,350
but the old memories just flooded back in.

281
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,650
I was taken aback.

282
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,250
Had I at least been understanding of Yeon Joo.

283
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,040
Had I at least taken her side...

284
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,380
my sister, Yeon Joo...

285
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,600
she wouldn't have ended up like that.

286
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,400
When will you finally be able to free yourself

287
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,470
from the guilt toward your sister?

288
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,390
What can I do to

289
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,640
help heal the scar in your heart?

290
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,790
Thanks to you for being with me whenever things got hard,

291
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,480
because you were with me, I could bear it.

292
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,410
I'm so grateful that you're my husband.

293
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,850
I'm more grateful

294
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,080
that you're my wife.

295
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,160
Oh my! Wasn't it a brilliant performance?

296
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,610
We will take a quick break after the intermission and see you later.

297
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,040
Sir, I'll show you where you can rest.

298
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,530
I need to go use the restroom.

299
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,980
Okay.

300
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,550
I heard that woman is a mistress.

301
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,410
Oh my goodness! Really?

302
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,120
Mrs. Jeong's sister came by to meet with Mrs. Jeong

303
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,130
when she recognized her and told her sister.

304
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,740
So that sister used to live across from that woman.

305
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,800
I can't believe that!

306
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,500
She must live her life

307
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,760
flirting with married men.

308
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,480
Don't gossip about unconfirmed rumors.

309
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,840
Pardon?

310
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,460
Let's not talk about people behind their back

311
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,220
when you don't know the whole story.

312
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,620
What's going on? Why does it feel so intense?

313
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,610
I'll have some water, please.

314
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,470
Why does the water taste so bad?

315
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,680
- Manager Park. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

316
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,530
How the hell are you managing your membership these days?

317
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,170
Is there a problem?

318
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,360
Who cares if it's a high-end facility,

319
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,090
when you let just anyone in as members?

320
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,630
How is it different from the tacky neighborhood community club?

321
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,110
I'm not understanding you.

322
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,670
You should look more carefully into potential members and only accept those who are worthy.

323
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,230
Don't give everyone the membership just because they can pay.

324
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,210
Ma'am, there are no clubs

325
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,630
that recruit or do background checks on members. I'm sorry.

326
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,040
Wow. Then are you saying that

327
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,300
even if a woman who is dirty and inferior joins,

328
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,740
all you're going to say is,

329
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,930
"There's nothing I can do about it?"

330
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,690
What are you looking at? What?

331
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,030
- I guess you feel guilty about something. 
 - That's enough.

332
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,530
I mean, this woman...

333
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,820
Let's go, Mi Ra. Why should you have to listen to this?

334
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,600
She's not even worth dealing with.

335
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,750
This woman is a mistress!

336
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,600
- You're taking her side without knowing anything! 
 - That's hot!

337
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,160
Oh no! I am so sorry.

338
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Are you okay? Did you get burned?

339
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,570
Seriously, what's wrong with you?!

340
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,280
Let's go.

341
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,950
That young thing was being so rude!

342
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,790
Well, she is pretty, but

343
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,050
those kinds of girls... I'll call you back.

344
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,320
What? What is it?

345
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,270
What do you want?

346
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,160
What are you doing?

347
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,500
Hold on! Are you crazy?

348
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,910
Did you attack me without expecting me to counterattack?

349
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,190
What? Are you going to tell everyone about this, too?

350
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,720
Why? You think I can't?

351
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,720
Do what you want.

352
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,850
Feel free.

353
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,290
Oh my god!

354
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,520
Is anyone there?

355
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,200
♫  Hello. Hello, anybody there?  ♫

356
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,840
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

357
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,130
♫  If you are still there  ♫

358
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,390

359
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,450
♫  On the streets where even the gods left  ♫

360
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,970
♫  What kind of justice? What is the standard?  ♫

361
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,470
♫  Shall I hold your hand?  ♫

362
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,210
♫  No one knows  ♫

363
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,560
♫  If you can still hear me  ♫

364
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,340
♫  If I have your heart  ♫

365
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:45,800

366
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,740
Did you know

367
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,380
that you were my role model?

368
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,700
I wanted to live like a heroine in a fairy tale...

369
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,580
but everything is ruined now.

370
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,290
Wherever you go, have a good life.

371
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,590
Live happily too, Han Seon Joo.

372
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,580
Like now, forever.

373
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,280
We finished loading!

374
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,920
All right, let's go.

375
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,080
She finally left.

376
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,710
I'm a little sad.

377
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,200
In the end, marriage is either when you withstand the pain and keep pushing through,

378
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,880
or inflict pain on each other and die little by little.

379
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,290
Isn't it one of the two?

380
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,190
What is she talking about now?

381
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,430
I'm leaving.

382
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,480
I really hope that whoever moves in

383
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,110
will be normal.

384
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,460
If you get divorced, I'm going to kill myself.

385
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,080
Mom. I saw Hye Rim recently, and seriously,

386
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,370
she was hanging out with weird kids and smoking.

387
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,490
I was so shocked.

388
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,190
But if I was her, I don't think I would have been able to deal with it either.

389
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,120
Let's go get ready to go out.

390
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,450
What are you doing here at this hour?

391
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,010
I think I need to take the kids somewhere.

392
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,440
Where?

393
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,200
That's...

394
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm really late. I'll tell you when we get back.

395
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,520
Kids, come with me.

396
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,220
I was about to go volunteer with the kids.

397
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,890
You can do it next time.

398
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,590
Let's go.

399
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,740
What are you doing? I told you we're late.

400
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,540
Hurry up.

401
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,970
Mi Ra, what brings you here?

402
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,870
I wanted to return your scarf.

403
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,790
You could have returned it later.

404
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,350
You came all the way for this?

405
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,210
I'm sorry,

406
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,900
I want to offer you some tea, but I was about to go out.

407
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,120
It's okay. It's my fault for showing up without notice.

408
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,460
I'll drop you off at your apartment on my way out.

409
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,150
Let's go.

410
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,800
Can I ask where you're going?

411
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,030
I'm going to a care center for single-parent families.

412
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,000
A care center for single-parent families?

413
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,350
I go there once a month and volunteer.

414
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,590
That's good of you to do.

415
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,220
At first, I also thought I was going to do something good,

416
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,920
but after a while, I realized I was getting so much more.

417
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,190
Like a gift.

418
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,910
I see.

419
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,030
Do you want me to drop you off near your apartment?

420
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,200
By chance, can I come, too?

421
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,220
Pardon?

422
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,840
I'd like to go to the center for single-parent families.

423
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,480
Really?

424
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,380
I was supposed to volunteer with my kids,

425
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,320
but their dad intercepted.

426
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,290
Since they could use any help even if it's from the kids.

427
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,880
I'll go with you.

428
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,620
Thank you.

429
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,950
- Ta da! 
 - Wow!

430
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,120
What is this, Dad?

431
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,550
Let's go camping today.

432
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,130
Dad, you're the best!

433
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,840
- What are you doing? 
 - I agree.

434
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,150
Okay, let's go!

435
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,950
Let's go!

436
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,590
I'll do it.

437
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,620
This one is for me.

438
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,190
It came out well.

439
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,470
Aren't you tired?

440
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,640
Not at all. I'm having a nice time.

441
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,630
The kids really like you.

442
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,570
I love playing with kids.

443
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,120
Playing with them, like you said,

444
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,180
I feel like I'm receiving a gift.

445
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,220
This is my gift to you.

446
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,830
I gave it back to you, though.

447
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,710
I wanted to give it to you. Please take it.

448
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,650
Thank you.

449
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,980
 What's going on?

450
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,390
 We meet again.

451
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,090

452
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,900
Wasn't the issue with getting into the Shanghai department store all resolved?

453
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,800
I know.

454
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,600
I thought it was over too, but now they're saying something else.

455
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,800
I need to go there and see if I can negotiate with them myself.

456
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,740
You'll do well as always.

457
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,250
I feel stronger since you're cheering me on.

458
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,780
Be strong.

459
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,920
- I'll be back. 
 - Bye.

460
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,190

461
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,350
 I suddenly have to go on a business trip. I won't be able to come by for a few days.

462
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,800
 Don't skip meals just because you can't be bothered, and make sure to eat.

463
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,220
Even so, Myeong Seop is an executive director,

464
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,800
isn't it a bit unfair for him to do everything when someone else could do it?

465
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,600
If he wants the benefit of being my son-in-law, then he should be working harder than everyone else.

466
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,470
So how long are you going to be a housewife?

467
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,670
When Tae Hee and Tae Yong go to college, will you start working again then?

468
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,730
It's time for you to acknowledge your son-in-law.

469
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,640
I acknowledge that he's good at what he does.

470
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,770
He may be hiding his claws now,

471
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,960
but one day, he'll reveal what he wants someday.

472
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,440
Please don't look at him with prejudice for no reason.

473
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,710
Don't trust him!

474
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,660
- Never. 
 - I chose him, though.

475
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,860
So, Mom, please stop–

476
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,100
You chose him, not me.

477
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,750
You might have succeeded as a businesswoman,

478
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,340
but you failed in taking care of your family.

479
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,060
I don't want to end up like you.

480
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,640
You don't know what your father did to me!

481
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,040
Do you even realize what you two

482
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,310
did to me, Yeon Joo, and Jeong Won?

483
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,810
You made us into orphans because of your emotional fights with each other!

484
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,070
I don't want to live like you. I'm going to

485
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,020
protect my family perfectly, as I have done.

486
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,310
I am going to make sure my kids, Tae Hee and Tae Yong,

487
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,860
grow up in a normal family, not lacking anything.

488
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,990
Having a happy family

489
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,980
is my life's goal.

490
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,640
 Do you have time right now?

491
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,360
You majored in art, right?

492
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,330
How did you know?

493
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:39,460
The way you look at art is different,

494
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,050
Like some keen eye of a professional.

495
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,750
My dream was to become an artist when I was younger.

496
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:49,460
Now, I teach kids at an art school.

497
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,640
- Twice a week. 
 - I knew it.

498
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,860
You must be good at painting then.

499
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,380
I was always envious of people who could draw.

500
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,850
My younger siblings...

501
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,990
My siblings...

502
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,910
draw well, too.

503
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,410
You have younger siblings?

504
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,750
I have one younger brother...

505
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,800
and one sister...

506
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,300
My brother is in Milan studying design.

507
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:22,100
And your sister? Does she also paint?

508
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,110
No.

509
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:27,520
Then, what does she do now?

510
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,300
She passed away.

511
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,150
I know what the people at Queen's Club

512
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,240
are saying about me.

513
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,880
They whisper that I'm having an affair

514
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,530
with a married man, don't they?

515
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,140
Isn't it ridiculous?

516
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,200
After all, people that make up gossip are all writers.

517
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,740
It's because you're pretty.

518
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,110
Because they're jealous.

519
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,950
Why are you being nice to me?

520
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,980
Me? What did I do for you?

521
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,360
You were nice to me.

522
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,150
I've never had anyone be

523
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,410
this kind to me before.

524
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,340
Well...

525
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,440
we have a special fate.

526
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:54,490
It's not easy to meet by chance while traveling and bump into each other again.

527
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,410
But to be honest,

528
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,080
when I first saw you on the ferry in Yeosu,

529
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,760
you reminded me of my sister.

530
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,980
I don't know why, though.

531
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,670
You and my sister

532
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,180
don't even look alike.

533
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,680
The one who died...

534
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,810
Should I be your sister from now on?

535
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,130
I'm sorry. I was presumptuous.

536
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,220
Don't let it bother you. I didn't mean it.

537
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,190
I would like that.

538
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Someone as pretty as you are is willing to be my sister...

539
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,420
I'd really love that.

540
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,600
Really?

541
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,230
Let's be sisters from this moment on.

542
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,000
Then please speak comfortably.

543
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,850
Since I'm your sister from now on.

544
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,510
Then I will.

545
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,160
Okay.

546
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,490
Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun today. Thank you, Sis.

547
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,230
Me too, Sis.

548
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,230
Head inside.

549
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,350
Get home safe.

550
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:47,930
I... have something to tell you.

551
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,690
I feel like I should be honest with you.

552
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,730
Actually...

553
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,310
the rumor is true.

554
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,010
I'm...

555
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,620
in love with another woman's husband.

556
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,780
You're surprised, aren't you?

557
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,750
I'm a little taken aback...

558
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,940
I'll get going then.

559
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,050
I'll call you later.

560
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,400
 I'm in love with another woman's husband.

561
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,570
 You must be crazy.

562
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,090
 That's a crime. It's theft.

563
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,840
 You're a home wrecker.

564
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,280
 But I love him. Truly.

565
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,660
 Yeon Joo...

566
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,710
 If you point your finger at me too, then I really have nowhere to go.

567
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,320
 Sister, please help me.

568
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,840
 Help me, Sister!

569
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,570
 Have you forgotten what pain

570
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,160
 we went through after Dad abandoned us and left?

571
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,620
 How could you...

572
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,010
 You of all people! How could you do something like that!

573
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,970
 Break up with him right now.

574
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,160
 I can't live without him!

575
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,740
 I can't live a day without him!

576
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,310
 I feel like I'll die if I can't see him!

577
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,110
 Die then!

578
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,280
 Die then, you crazy wench!

579
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,750
 Die! Die right now!

580
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,730
 Die! Die! Die!

581
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,740

582
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,880
It's me, Han Seon Joo.

583
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,070
Let's meet.

584
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,720
 In this place, the girl everyone loved, dreaming of eternal love.

585
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,600
This is my sister, Han Yeon Joo.

586
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:05,050
My sister, too, loved someone she shouldn't have.

587
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,600
Like you.

588
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,100
In the end, she died because of that intense love.

589
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:20,810
The end is always the same for affairs.

590
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,290
You know, too.

591
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:34,390
The end of your love... how it will be.

592
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,140
It's not been long since we met, so it could come across as me being rude,

593
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:02,270
but I'm saying this... because you really feel like my younger sister.

594
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,080
That love...

595
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,360
stop it.

596
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:33,140
I tried to stop it, too.

597
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:39,060
I went to Yeosu to stop the affair, as the last goodbye trip.

598
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,540
But... But I couldn't.

599
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,350
I don't think I can live without him.

600
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,550
I don't like myself being this way, but I can't help it.

601
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:09,670
I'd rather die than break up with him.

602
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:19,150
 I can't live a day without him. I feel like I'll die if I can't see him!

603
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:22,310
 Die then. Die! You crazy wench!

604
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,590
 Die! Die right now!

605
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,340
 Die! Die!

606
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,320
Then have that man.

607
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:06,300
If you can't let him go, take him.

608
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,370
If you can't break up with him, if you feel like dying without him,

609
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:15,300
then become that man's wife.

610
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:17,550
Instead of dying.

611
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:26,720
If you feel like you'll die, then you should

612
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,900
make him yours instead.

613
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,460

614
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,880
Do you mean that?

615
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,010
Telling me to...

616
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,400
make him mine, do you mean that?

617
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,380
I mean it.

618
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,720
If you love him to death and can't break up with him, don't hesitate. Take action.

619
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,360
Instead of dying like a fool, make him completely yours.

620
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,520
Even if you have to steal or snatch him away.

621
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,180
Become that man's wife is what I'm telling you.

622
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:26,360
I'll be on your side, Mi Ra.

623
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:33,930

624
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:44,790
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

625
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,100
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

626
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,610
♫  If you are still there  ♫

627
01:02:54,910 --> 01:03:00,000
♫  To me, if you feel like that  ♫

628
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,020
♫  If there is anything left to tell, to me  ♫

629
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,010
♫  Anything is fine  ♫

630
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,290
♫  The bright lights of this city  ♫

631
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,600
♫  My footsteps have been erased  ♫

632
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,150
♫  Hearing your presence  ♫

633
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,270

♫  The unspoken screams get louder  ♫

634
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:26,660
 Today is my wife's birthday. I got one for you, too.

635
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,990
 What am I to you?

636
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,500
 You said you wouldn't complain even if you lived in the shadows all your life.

637
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,750
 Just because you cut off contact, did you think I couldn't find you?

638
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:38,190
 You'll only stop this if I die, right? Then I'll die.

639
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:43,610
 Who are you?

640
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,120
 I'm her sister.

641
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,340
 Was he supposed to come over tonight?

642
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:52,220
 How is Myeong Seop these days?

643
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:57,310
 I think that bracelet is from the same set as your necklace.

644
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,620
 Can I ask where you bought it?

645
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,200
 Where did you buy ...

646
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,800
 that bracelet?

647
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,600
♫  Hello. Sorry, I can't hear you well  ♫
