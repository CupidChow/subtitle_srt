1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,530

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,130
I... will get to the top.

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,270
As the chairman of LaReine Group.

4
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,490
Do you think I can't?

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,710
Just watch and see.

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,660
What and how I do it.

7
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,170

8
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,070
Mother-in-Law is getting released tomorrow, right?

9
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,350
Yeah.

10
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,300
Good, I'm glad.

11
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:02,000
But... the person who submitted gallery files to the prosecution...

12
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,690
was you, I heard.

13
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,480
That's right.

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,870
I did.

15
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,660
Where... did you get those files?

16
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,570
Why are you curious about that?

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Is there a reason you can't tell me?

18
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Section Chief Kim.

19
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,020
I got them from her.

20
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,410
The one who was fired right after Yoon Mi Ra was made director.

21
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,570
That's good.

22
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,200
Would you like some wine?

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,250
Wait here then.

24
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,760
Thank you.

25
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,120
I am looking forward to tomorrow.

26
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,490
Now everything will... return to their rightful places.

27
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,390
Here.

28
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,770

29
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,500
President Shin.

30
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,210
Shin Myeong Seop!

31
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,960
You're here, Chairwoman.

32
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,120
Breaking my precious daughter's heart

33
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,160
and even hurting my poor son. It wouldn't be enough

34
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,090
to grind you and Yoon Mi Ra up,

35
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,000
but get divorced from Seon Joo.

36
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,440
You don't deserve it,

37
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,530
but I'll give you the apparel department as alimony.

38
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,850
Take the apparel and get lost?

39
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,750
I can't do that.

40
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,410
What?

41
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,630
Do you think that LaReine belongs to you?

42
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,290
Let me make it clear.

43
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,480
LaReine is mine.

44
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,950
Not yours, Chairwoman Kim Kang Im.

45
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,830
It belongs to me, Shin Myeong Seop.

46
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm telling you that no one besides me can own LaReine.

47
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,270
Crazy bastard...

48
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,950
I saw that the chairwoman was released.

49
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,700
The files you gave me,

50
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,780
I submitted them to the prosecution.

51
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,010
Tae Yong's been cleared of all charges, right?

52
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,750
Yes.

53
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,920
Why do realizations always happen too late?

54
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,650
Since we're human.

55
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,920
We're foolish human beings.

56
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,190
I remember something you told me once.

57
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,690
Telling me to stop that love.

58
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,800
 I'm saying this because you feel like my sister.

59
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,530
 That love...

60
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,070
 stop it.

61
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,300
 You know, too.

62
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,080
 How that love will end.

63
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,610
I tried to stop it many times.

64
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,430
But I couldn't.

65
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,760
The one who should have stopped wasn't you or me.

66
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,770
It was Shin Myeong Seop.

67
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,820
My love... was real.

68
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,420
My love was... real, too.

69
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,820
But with that love...

70
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,500
Shin Myeong Seop deceived us.

71
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,150
I will never forgive him.

72
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:59,040
Shin Myeong Seop crossed a river he shouldn't have.

73
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,320
The one who stabbed Yoon Mi Ra

74
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,290
was Seon Joo.

75
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,690
What are you talking about?

76
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,220

77
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,190

78
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,580
The fingerprint and DNA on the knife

79
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,840
have been confirmed.

80
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,720
It can't be...

81
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,920
The police are still

82
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,460
searching for the real crime weapon.

83
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,510
What should I do?

84
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,890
Should I submit the knife and the documents to the police?

85
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,830
You bastard...

86
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,700
Don't worry too much. I'll protect Seon Joo.

87
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,360
In return,

88
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,290
give it to me...

89
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,770
LaReine.

90
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,390
Shin Myeong Seop!

91
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,320
Why?

92
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,900
Do you still believe that

93
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm not fit to be the owner of

94
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,640
LaReine Group?

95
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,350
Keep pretending you've lost your memory.

96
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,520
That's the only way you can stay alive.

97
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,370
The moment he finds out that you've regained your memories,

98
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,000
Shin Myeong Seop will kill you.

99
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,510
Why are you helping me?

100
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,690
Isn't it better that I die and disappear?

101
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,970
Yoon Mi Ra...

102
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,830
let's end it now.

103
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,610
Let's you and I...

104
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,580
end it once and for all.

105
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,480
Shin Myeong Seop.

106
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,710
I caught you.

107
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,110

108
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,470
Is the pig's feet's delivery already...

109
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,660
Who are you?

110
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,690
Pig's feet, my butt.

111
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,470
Move!

112
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,250
Who's shouting so loud in front of our house?

113
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,650
It's so uneducated!

114
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,040
Who are you? Why are you barging into my house?

115
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,570
Where is he?

116
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,680
Hey, Lee Joon Sang.

117
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,310
- H-H-Honey. 
 - Honey?

118
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,570
You bastard...

119
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,620
Honey, it's not what you're thinking.

120
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,140
It was so hot, so I came in for a second to take a shower.

121
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,730
If you're going to make an excuse,

122
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,460
come up with something more realistic!

123
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,010
Hello.

124
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,810
What's good?

125
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,420
There you go.

126
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,410
Thank you.

127
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,350
Good bye.

128
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,350
Are you coming from somewhere?

129
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,960
Yeah.

130
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,910
I feel stifled staying home all the time.

131
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,370
There was nothing to eat either.

132
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,860
I went out to eat.

133
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,760
You should have asked me to bring whatever you wanted to eat.

134
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,300
It's not good to be out in the cold.

135
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,590
I only went somewhere nearby.

136
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,190
If you need anything, tell me.

137
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,530
I'll bring it on my way here.

138
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,010
Okay.

139
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,490
But...

140
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,190
why are those wedding shoes... here?

141
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,690
They're my wife's, right?

142
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,620
I know.

143
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,630
I don't understand it either.

144
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,880
Among the items the police returned to me as part of the evidence,

145
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
was a bloodied wedding dress and those shoes.

146
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,730
I threw away the dress since it was covered in blood and it made me feel uncomfortable,

147
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,140
but I couldn't throw away those wedding shoes.

148
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,860
Why were those wedding shoes...

149
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,090
among the evidence?

150
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,680
There's no way Han Seon Joo would have given them to me.

151
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,820
Perhaps...

152
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,530
did you give them to me?

153
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,570
What happened to me that day exactly?

154
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,790
I'll go now.

155
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,400
Take it with you.

156
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,030
They're not mine.

157
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,780
They should be returned to the owner.

158
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,150
Okay.

159
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,680

160
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,150
 The call cannot be connected and it will be forwarded to...

161
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,230
How was it today?

162
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,830
I saw your mother.

163
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,520
I was worried,

164
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,510
but she looked well.

165
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,970
Really?

166
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,420
There was nothing new?

167
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,350
Like what?

168
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,260
Since she's back at work,

169
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,750
we'll be getting the company running back to normal.

170
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,560
Here.

171
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,780
Mi Ra... told me to give them to you.

172
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,860
Has Yoon Mi Ra's memory returned?

173
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,280
No.

174
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,250
Maybe it's a relief to you that she hasn't gained her memory back.

175
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,800
What do you mean?

176
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,710
When she finds out that we had a remind wedding,

177
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,120
I feel like she'll do something.

178
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,040
Won't she feel betrayed by you?

179
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,300
But what do I do?

180
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,710
I don't need them anymore either.

181
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,840
They've been too dirtied.

182
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,680
 They're not mine.

183
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,130
 They should be returned to the owner.

184
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,710
 But what do I do? I don't need them anymore either.

185
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,140
 They've been too dirtied.

186
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,730
Yes?

187
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,560
 Oh, Sir.

188
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,130
There's a huge problem. What should I do?

189
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,180
 The imitation incident from two years ago,

190
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,280
the Chinese broker from back then is in Korea.

191
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,180
What?

192
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,010
Why all of a sudden?

193
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm not sure.

194
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,530
But...

195
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,760
do you know who that broker came to see?

196
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,820
Do you want another cup of coffee?

197
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,930
Okay, I'll have another.

198
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,570

199
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,540
Make sure you line yourself up well.

200
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,830
I don't know how much they promised you,

201
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,970
but President Shin, no,

202
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,080
standing in line with Chairman Shin

203
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,080
is beneficial to us in many ways.

204
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,640
Thank you.

205
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,740
Oh, the coffee is nice and rich.

206
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,310

207
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,500
You're supposed to meet with someone at LaReine?

208
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,250
Well, it happened that way.

209
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,080
Why are you meeting with them?

210
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,150
The thing is, he was promised

211
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,770
a lot of money if he hands over the details of the illegal

212
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,510
borrowed-name account of the person responsible

213
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,000
for the distribution of the fake products from two years ago.

214
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,450
I feel regretful towards you, President, but...

215
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,170
I had no other choice.

216
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,370
If you dare to say another word,

217
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,810
I will kill you.

218
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,510
Where's the file?

219
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,870
Where is it?

220
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,040
It's in that b-bag.

221
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,740

222
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,400
Where's the original copy?

223
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,200
 He's asking where it is!

224
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,150
 That's all I have. There's no original copy.

225
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,780
 We'll get in trouble if we get caught, too,

226
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,100
 so we got rid of everything back then. I'm telling you the truth.

227
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,070
 That copy is all we have.

228
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,900
Who do you think LaReine belongs to?

229
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,080
Think carefully before you make your decision.

230
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,010
About who you need to line yourself up with.

231
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,000
Also...

232
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,730
I'll compensate you with something bigger,

233
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,620
so bring me the original copy by tomorrow.

234
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,630
What are you doing? Answer him!

235
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,590
I understand.

236
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,420
Mom.

237
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,490
What's wrong?

238
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,200
Why didn't you answer the phone?

239
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,530
Seon Joo.

240
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,360
You...

241
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,990
It's not you, right?

242
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,580
What do you mean?

243
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,770
Mom.

244
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,000
What's this?

245
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,630

246
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,960
President Shin brought it to me.

247
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,720
He said it's proof showing you're the one who stabbed Yoon Mi Ra.

248
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,480
He brought that

249
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,990
and told me

250
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,820
to hand over LaReine.

251
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,090
 I'll compensate you with something bigger,

252
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,800
 so bring me the original copy by tomorrow.

253
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,250
 What are you doing? Answer him.

254
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,270
 I understand.

255
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,100
Thanks for making such an effort.

256
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,920
He promised to give me the original copy.

257
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,460
This should be enough.

258
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,730
Jeong Won.

259
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,930
Mom will announce it soon.

260
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,670
That Shin Myeong Seop...

261
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,290
will become the chairman of LaReine.

262
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,280
What...

263
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,920
What do you mean?

264
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,820
It just happened that way.

265
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,750
Why?

266
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,240
Why is she making him the chairman?

267
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,670
We even have evidence that he's the culprit behind the illegal fake product incident in China!

268
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,620
So why?

269
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,870
I know...

270
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,160
how hard you've worked on this.

271
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,370
I know...

272
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,450
but let's stop here.

273
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,510
Bastard.

274
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,150
What did he do?

275
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,190
What did he do to you and Mother again?!

276
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,330
It's nothing like that.

277
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,760
I know it's hard to understand.

278
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,410
But could you just

279
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,740
let it go?

280
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,820
No.

281
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,750
I can't accept it.

282
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,030

283
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,540
 Mom...

284
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,800
 Do what he wants.

285
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,730
 Seon Joo...

286
00:32:52,730 --> 00:33:00,710
 That will be the way... we save LaReine.

287
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:07,580

288
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,820
 Shin Myeong Seop will be named LaReine's Chairman soon.

289
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,040

290
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,030
Wait a moment.

291
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,350
It's crooked.

292
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,990
Okay.

293
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,550
Done.

294
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,240
Come on.

295
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920

296
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,590

297
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,670

298
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,910

299
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,600
You still haven't left?

300
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,520
Your dream finally came true.

301
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,750
Have a seat.

302
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,920
It's abrupt of you...

303
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,690
You look wonderful.

304
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,720
I wanted to see it.

305
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,380
You sitting in the chairman position.

306
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,720
 Chairman, the board meeting is ready.

307
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,420
 Chairman?

308
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,310
All right, got it.

309
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,100
I'll be on my way.

310
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,160
Okay.

311
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,650
Yes, Mi Ra.

312
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,600
This evening?

313
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,500
Okay, got it.

314
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,550
I can't acknowledge it.

315
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,820
I don't know what tricks you used to convince my mother and sister,

316
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,540
but I will definitely drag you down.

317
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,200
I thought you were on my side.

318
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,540
I'm disappointed, Brother-in-Law.

319
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,270
I have never once been on your side.

320
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:19,580
Nice try with the Chinese broker.

321
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,620
Your Achilles heel is in my hands.

322
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,360
Don't get too excited about being chairman.

323
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,340
Because nothing is done until it's over.

324
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,500
Brother-in-Law, how long are you going to be like this?

325
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:53,420
Work for LaReine, not Han Seon Joo.

326
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,350
Let's go.

327
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:21,560
In the first half of 2022, LaReine Jewelry precede the fame of K-jewelry,

328
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,260
and will focus on the Southeast Asian market.

329
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,980

330
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,980
 We are expecting over an 18% sales increase compared to last year.

331
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,700
 Executive Director Shin,

332
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,610
 Yes?

333
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,360
 Does this position look easy to you?

334
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,680
 As you rise step by step,

335
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,060
 your knees will tire to the extent of shattering. That is the road to this seat.

336
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,210
 Establishing yourself? There's still a long way to go.

337
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,410
 Don't get full of yourself, and start with learning about lowering yourself humbly.

338
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,740
Are the factories located in Southeast Asia having issues with the supply and demand of raw materials?

339
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,310
Pardon?

340
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:28,690
The raw material supply and demand issue that appeared during the strike,

341
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,550
are you confident that it won't come up again?

342
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,790
I will check that later.

343
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,980
About imports and exports...

344
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,130
have the restriction policies for each country been researched?

345
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,350
Yes, I will plan thoroughly.

346
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,190
Let's not get comfortable.

347
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:58,460
The spots that you are all sitting in now, will not always be promised to you.

348
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:05,500
If you don't perform as expected, those seats can be taken from you ruthlessly at any moment. Keep that in mind.

349
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,440
Work so hard that your knees could shatter,

350
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,240
and show me clear results.

351
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,200
Don't get full of yourself, and work hard without stopping.

352
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,760
Did the inauguration ceremony go well?

353
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,390
Yes.

354
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,030
What is this?

355
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:04,860
Mom, you worked really hard all this time.

356
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,220
Go to Hawaii, and take a break.

357
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,610
And if you were to take my kids with you

358
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,830
and comfort them a bit, I would appreciate it.

359
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,830
Tae Hee and Tae Yong used to be chatty

360
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,970
and smile easily, but they have changed.

361
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:42,170
They don't smile... or talk as much.

362
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,070
It won't take long.

363
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,400
Please do it for me.

364
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,840
All right, I got it.

365
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,570
Don't worry about the kids.

366
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,620
I will bring them back safe and sound.

367
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,570
I prepared something for you.

368
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,300
Here.

369
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,670
What is all of this?

370
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,590
I tried out my skills.

371
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,400
Have a seat.

372
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,460
Wow.

373
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,540
You always made me delicious food,

374
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,620
I wanted to do it for you, too.

375
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,380
And...

376
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,990
you finally got what you wanted.

377
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:16,390
Of course, I should congratulate you.

378
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,120
Thanks.

379
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,360
This really is the end.

380
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,980
End?

381
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,190
There's nowhere higher for you to go.

382
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,710
Oh...

383
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,140
What I do from now on is more important.

384
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,130
I will definitely raise LaReine to be a global enterprise.

385
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,760
You're like a broken brake.

386
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,110
You don't know how to stop.

387
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,530
- Hurry and eat, before it gets cold. 
 - Okay.

388
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,690

389
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,850
 I'm ready.

390
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,280
 I'll be waiting for your response.

391
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,580
What kind of text is it?

392
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,500
Spam.

393
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,510
Telling me they'll give me a loan.

394
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,190
It's me?

395
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,700
It's pretty good.

396
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,570
But what's with the portrait all of a sudden?

397
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,990
To remember.

398
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,190
What?

399
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:11,310
Sometimes... there are times when I can't remember your face.

400
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,270
Even though I see your face like this every day,

401
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,370
there are times when

402
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,600
I can't remember what you look like.

403
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,810
That's why I drew it.

404
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,740
So that I could remember it clearly.

405
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,020
Your face.

406
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,210
The time when you

407
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,250
were inaugurated as Executive Director, is coming to mind.

408
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,120
I threw you a congratulatory party back then, too.

409
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,980
You did.

410
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,210
Back then,

411
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,840
I was so happy...

412
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,520
What about now?

413
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,690
Now...

414
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,550
I'm even happier, of course.

415
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,210
I'm as happy as can be.

416
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,950
Have you had dinner?

417
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,060
Jeong Won...

418
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,440
Don't try too hard.

419
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,750
You can't convince me.

420
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,460
If you don't want to say anything, you don't have to.

421
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,320
Even though I got clear evidence to take Shin Myeong Seop down,

422
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,710
why you made him chairman

423
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,590
and the reason that you can't tell me,

424
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,220
I will find out on my own.

425
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,250
Whatever that bastard Shin Myeong Seop is using

426
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,830
to pressure you and mother,

427
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,390
I will expose it at all costs.

428
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,060
Where did you go?

429
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,620
To Jeong Won's place.

430
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,090
What's the reason?

431
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,750
My becoming chairman...

432
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,380
why are you accepting it so passively?

433
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,980
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

434
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,840
It's dirty.

435
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,730
The mud fight.

436
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,380

437
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,480
 I thought it over repeatedly,

438
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,710
 and I think that it would be best for me to do it.

439
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,540
 The person who started all of this should finish it.

440
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,460
 I will end Shin Myeong Seop.

441
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,270
Let's meet tomorrow.

442
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:56,390

443
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,290
You came?

444
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,120
I was surprised to get a call from you.

445
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,680
I thought that you wouldn't meet me for the rest of my life.

446
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,850
- Would you like something to drink? 
 - Take a seat.

447
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,840
Seon Joo...

448
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,040
I messed up.

449
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,000
Since it would be too shameless of me to ask you for forgiveness,

450
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,720
I can't do it.

451
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,660
I'll apologize sincerely.

452
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,510
Han Seon Joo.

453
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,880
Yeong Hoon,

454
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,770
I don't think I'll be able to forgive you.

455
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,910
But I don't want to hate you, either.

456
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,610
To be honest,

457
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,710
I came because I have a favor to ask.

458
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,470
I would appreciate it if you heard me out.

459
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,580
Tell me.

460
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,000
If it's within my abilities,

461
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,070
I'll do anything.

462
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,350
Here is the original copy USB.

463
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,180
And the broker?

464
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,840
He already got his money, why would he hang around?

465
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,190
He'll be leaving soon.

466
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:17,140
There's something else that I need the two of you to do for me.

467
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,770
Pardon?

468
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,370
Take care of it.

469
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,330
Cleanly, without a trace.

470
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,970
Excuse me?

471
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,870
Me?

472
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,810
May I ask why?

473
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,650
 I don't need it anymore.

474
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,160
 Even then, how could I–

475
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,640
Why? You can't do it?

476
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,460
If you don't feel like it, you don't have to.

477
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:15,330
There are plenty of people that will do it, given they are paid accordingly.

478
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,440
No, I'll do it.

479
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,830
I'll do it.

480
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,350
Jeong Won.

481
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,380
Jeong Won?

482
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,630

483
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,210
Phone...

484
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,440

485
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:33,030

486
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,950
 This is Jang Rim.

487
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:42,350
 Executive Director Shin requested that I secretly look into

488
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,930
 whether LaReine Shoemaking could be sold to a Chinese company.

489
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,820
 This is urgent.

490
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,080
 Please come to the address listed below.

491
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,150
 Room 420 of Donglin Shopping Center in Hwayeong neighborhood, Seocheong district.

492
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:33,870
He's going to sell LaReine Shoemaking?

493
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,550
You went through a lot, all that time.

494
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:55,010
Rest comfortably now.

495
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,010
All that's left for us is happiness.

496
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,120
Happy... how nice.

497
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,840
I can't help but think about when we went to Yeosu, all of a sudden.

498
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,700
Wait a moment.

499
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,930
Do you remember these shoes?

500
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,440
Of course, I remember them.

501
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,410
I had them made especially for you.

502
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:50,050
When you put these shoes on me, you said that

503
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:54,120
high heels are like combat boots for women.

504
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:00,640
That regardless of what hardships lie ahead of me, I should put these on and walk without hesitating.

505
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:09,750
And I said that I would win at whatever comes at me.

506
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,360
We won in the end.

507
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:21,020
I rose to the very top of LaReine.

508
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,650
We?

509
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,410
Yes, we.

510
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:39,050
You and I.

511
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,820
Again, congratulations.

512
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,380
Thanks.

513
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,930
What is it?

514
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,330
Stop it, now.

515
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,970
This show is no fun.

516
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,420
You evil bastard.

517
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,180
What did you say?

518
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,980
You came here to kill me, didn't you?

519
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,770
How are you going to do it?

520
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,410
Yoon Mi Ra...

521
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:23,370
But what to do? I was so wrong, that there's no way I'll die alone.

522
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,050
I'm going to end all of this today.

523
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:35,530
How are you going to end anything?

524
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,380
Right now,

525
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,360
this place is full of gas.

526
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,210
What are you doing right now?

527
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:21,580
I told you that I'm ending this today.

528
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,590
The moment I light this,

529
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:32,250
we will die together.

530
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,130
Put that down.

531
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,040
I remember everything.

532
01:05:52,740 --> 01:06:00,320
You stabbing me and trying to kill me in the hospital, I remember it all, you bastard!

533
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:07,620
Things have gotten rather comfortable.

534
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,490
What?

535
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,380
Let's end this for real right now.

536
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:22,620
You should die for me.

537
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:26,680
No? I will never die alone!

538
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,340
I'm going to die with you.

539
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:37,080
Let's die together, Myeong Seop.

540
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,170
If you can light it, go ahead.

541
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,430
Do you think I won't be able to?

542
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,620
Give that to me.

543
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,390
Do think something like you will be able to kill me?

544
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,110
Something like you?

545
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,440
Yeah, something like you.

546
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:43,420
I loved you,

547
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,750
but you were nothing but a puppet

548
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,340
to satisfy my desires.

549
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,100
Shin Myeong Seop!

550
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:35,910

551
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:51,330
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

552
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:58,420
♫  For you to see I’m no company  ♫

553
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:06,020
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

554
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:13,860
♫  I guess you don't know that. I guess how I feel  ♫

555
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:17,580

~ Preview ~

556
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,440
 There's something that I was never able to say.

557
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,850
 I'm sorry.

558
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:27,000
 So I've decided to leave everything behind and leave.

559
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,870
 Goodbye.

560
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,870
 Why did you do that to me?

561
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,460
 Was my devotion to you not enough?

562
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,530
 Things didn't go as planned.

563
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:43,810
 Seeing that things turned out this way, I'm sure you know very well what you should do.

564
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,750
 Take care of it.

565
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:49,680
 Honey, goodbye.

566
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:55,430
♫  Heaven made  ♫
