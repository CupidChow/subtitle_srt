1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,340

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:10,170
Han Jeong Won, what was your relationship with Yoon Mi Ra?

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,950
I...

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,660
loved that woman.

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,800
Lovers?

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,230
You were lovers?

7
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,100
Were you aware that she was

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,630
your brother-in-law's mistress?

9
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,560
I didn't at first.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,140
Han Jeong Won, did you harm Yoon Mi Ra?

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,680
Han Jeong Won, did you stab her in the abdomen

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,470
and wound her?

13
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,440
Yoon Mi Ra...

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,640
Do you want to die?

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,980
I was officially invited here by your sister.

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,600
Please treat me with respect.

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,150
Something fun will happen soon.

18
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,550
Be excited.

19
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,870
Do you believe there's such a thing as love?

20
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,940
Love is something you can never believe in, even though everyone says they do.

21
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,790
Love? It might be the biggest lie made up by mankind.

22
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,570

23
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,090
When you go to war, you pray once.

24
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,900
When you go out to sea, you pray twice.

25
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,860
When you get married, you pray three times.

26
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,210
It's a famous proverb.

27
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,790
Then when a husband cheats?

28
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,710
Pray, my butt.

29
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,660
You have to kill him.

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,030

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,290
Huh? No way.

32
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,920
I know this house.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,500
- You do? 
 - You're going to be shocked.

34
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,420
It'll be fun.

35
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,200
Let's hurry in.

36
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,200
- Welcome. 
 -  Sis. 
 - Welcome, Jeong Won.

37
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,810
Myeong Seop.

38
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,170
Let me introduce you.

39
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,410
This is my girlfriend.

40
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,900
Hello.

41
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,610
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

42
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,270
Tae Hee. Tae Yong. Have you been well?

43
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,630
What? You know each other?

44
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,890
I told you you'd be shocked.

45
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,410
Have you been well, Sis?

46
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,600
It's been a while, Brother-in-Law.

47
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,580
Uncle, welcome!

48
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,150
Let's go in.

49
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,680
Honey.

50
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,350
Can't be...

51
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,370
Wait here.

52
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,320
What are you going to do?

53
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,040
We can't do nothing.

54
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,800
How dare she...

55
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,030
Do you intend on telling him in front of the kids that

56
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,960
you and Yoon Mi Ra were having an affair?

57
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,440
For now, stay calm.

58
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,630
Wow, I can't believe you two knew each other.

59
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,110
The world is so small.

60
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,720
It's amazing to meet like this.

61
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,240
It's an amazing fate we have.

62
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:47,160
I was really worried and nervous about how to make a good impression to his sister.

63
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,980
But I feel much better now that you're his sister.

64
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,930
Maybe I shouldn't?

65
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,560
Should I make an even better impression?

66
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,560
Sis.

67
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,760
You must be upset.

68
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,720
Since I moved away so suddenly without saying goodbye.

69
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,450
- You did? 
 - Yes. I didn't get a chance.

70
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,840
But now that I think about it,

71
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,120
you must have been very sad.

72
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,650
I apologize.

73
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,530
Mom. Dad. I'm hungry. Let's eat already.

74
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,810
When are we going to eat?

75
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,480
Oh yes. Let's eat.

76
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,950
Eat well, Brother-in-Law.

77
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,290
Please eat.

78
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,540
Mustard leaf kimchi.

79
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,810
How did the two of you meet?

80
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,770
Should we call it fate?

81
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,230
True love sent by the heavens.

82
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Are you all right?

83
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,200
I think my ankle broke!

84
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Shit. Damn heels!

85
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,530
There's no way it would break so easily...

86
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,890
What? Who are you to judge my shoes?

87
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,610
I'm the designer at the company that made your heels.

88
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,020
Really? I'm glad we met then.

89
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,810
After making subpar shoes like this and putting people's lives in danger,

90
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,310
what did you say? There's no way the heels would break?!

91
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,100
- I'm sorry. 
 - Take them off.

92
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,370
Take off your shoes.

93
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,320
Who are you now?

94
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,430
Are you on the same side as this guy?

95
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,220
- What are you doing? 
 - On the LaReine Group's Victoria series,

96
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,190
the sole and the heel cover are made in one piece.

97
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,740
But these shoes have two separate pieces using different materials.

98
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,530
What about that?

99
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,950
These weren't made by LaReine.

100
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,600
-  It's a fake, isn't it? Where did you get it from? 
 - No. I bought it from their store, and it's authentic!

101
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,610
- Which store? 
 - Damn it!

102
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,210
Annoying. You are ridiculous.

103
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,920
Thank you.

104
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,710
Wait a moment.

105
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,660
I'll go bring some wine.

106
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

107
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,160
Eat a lot.

108
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,070
This is Seon Joo's favorite wine.

109
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,590
Opening this means that you are a really special guest.

110
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,100
I drink it often.

111
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,420
Don't put too much meaning into it.

112
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,220
I've had this wine before.

113
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,060
When?

114
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,140
In the past, Seon Joo

115
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,190
had brought a special wine that was brought by her brother from Italy.

116
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,120
Oh, so that sibling was Jeong Won.

117
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080
You did?

118
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,230
Mustard leaf kimchi is so delicious.

119
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,700
Mustard leaf kimchi from other places doesn't taste like this one.

120
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,030
Are the ingredients good?

121
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,530
It is especially tasty.

122
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,790
My sister is a great cook.

123
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,280
I am curious. Can you give me the recipe?

124
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,700
I am not that great of a cook, but I want to make it for Jeong Won.

125
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,630
Honey, there's something on your face...

126
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,890
Kimchi sauce is on your face.

127
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,550
Why are you eating so messy like a child?

128
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,480
Can we call you "Aunt"?

129
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,110
- It's so nice to meet you. 
 - I agree.

130
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,560
Seon Joo, are you all right?

131
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,520
I'll go clean up the plate.

132
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,260
Seon Joo.

133
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,690
Is something going on?

134
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,760
Today you look a little sick.

135
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,440
Not at all.

136
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,290
Should I have used a brighter lipstick?

137
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,620
You must have worked hard preparing the meal today.

138
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,470
I am grateful and sorry also.

139
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,180
Go and have your meal.

140
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,800
- Seon Joo. 
 - Yeah...

141
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,490
Did something happen with Mi Ra, by any chance?

142
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,050
Why?

143
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,140
No. Just that you don't

144
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,950
seem like yourself today.

145
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,840
Really?

146
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,150
Did Mi Ra do something wrong?

147
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,990
Nothing like that.

148
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,640
Even if it was there, forgive her.

149
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,540
Please.

150
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,230
Forgive...

151
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,750
How long have you

152
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,090
known my brother-in-law, Jeong Won?

153
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,360
It's not important how long you've known someone.

154
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,550
What's important is that we love each other.

155
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,280
I actually really hurt my ankle.

156
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,580
Give me more for treatment cost.

157
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,150
You're trying to trick him to work for LaReine Group, aren't you?

158
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,310
No. To destroy them.

159
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh, please wait.

160
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,040
Thank you.

161
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,490
Oh, it's you again.

162
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,020
Yes...

163
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,640
- Do you live here? 
 - Do you live here?

164
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,400
You must work with shoes.

165
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,010
Yes, I am a shoe designer.

166
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,050
Shoe designer?

167
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,610
Mr. Shin Myeong Seop.

168
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,520
Aunt, how do you know our dad's name?

169
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,990
I heard it from your uncle.

170
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,220
I have a feeling we'll get along very well.

171
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,940
Don't you agree?

172
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,290
Do you like Mi Ra a lot?

173
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,930
You asked me once.

174
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,000
If I'm lonely.

175
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,170
Actually, I'm...

176
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,720
going to marry her.

177
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,540
Seon Joo!

178
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,520
You must have a bad cut!

179
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,640
Why? What happened?

180
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,980
Mom, you're bleeding.

181
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,930
What is this? How did this happen?

182
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,960
It's nothing serious.

183
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,680
Oh no!  You're bleeding a lot.

184
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,230
First, let us go to the hospital immediately.

185
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm fine. It's nothing.

186
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,090
Let's go inside and disinfect it for now.

187
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,550
Come, let's go in.

188
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,800
You don't have manners. Walking in without knocking.

189
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,120
What the hell are you doing?

190
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,780
Did you decide to torture me?

191
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,630
What's the point in hurting your pride when all you have left now is your wedding ring?

192
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,550
Why did you approach my brother, Jeong Won?

193
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,350
You told me once.

194
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,980
That I'll be able to have my own family, too.

195
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:15,290
So, I want to make my own family with Han Jeong Won.

196
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,850
What?

197
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,600
Why?

198
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,280
Can I not?

199
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,960
Listen to me carefully, Yoon Mi Ra.

200
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,670
I am warning you. Get away from my brother right now.

201
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,370
No, Han Seon Joo. It's your turn to listen to me now.

202
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,820
Should I tell everything to Jeong Won?

203
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,990
That I was Shin Myeong Seop's mistress, and I was pregnant with his child.

204
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,780
That's nothing. I'll just tell Jeong Won everything.

205
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,530
It's all right if you torture me,

206
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,310
but please don't play with my brother.

207
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,400
Now it looks like you understand the situation.

208
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,470
Who is holding the knife.

209
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,610
Don't worry.

210
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,890
I won't use it right now.

211
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
Can you tell me the truth?

212
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,500
You and my sister...

213
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,950
had something going on, right?

214
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,150
Today, my sister and brother-in-law

215
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,460
were different than normal. I want to know what happened.

216
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,250
I...

217
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,000
backstabbed Seon Joo.

218
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,570
She considered me her own sister,

219
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,590
but I cut off contact and moved out.

220
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,510
Because something happened in my family.

221
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,300
I changed my phone and cut off all contact.

222
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,230
She must have been really angry.

223
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,690
She has the right to be.

224
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,620
Let's go.

225
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,090
Don't come.

226
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,320
- Seon Joo. 
 - I want to stay alone.

227
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,530
Do you think I am not having a hard time? Even I am struggling.

228
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,870
But we have to fight together and win this.

229
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,380
Fight together?

230
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,650
For what? For whose sake?

231
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,190
Obviously, for our family.

232
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,290
Who the hell started all this? Why should I be a part of this annoying fight?

233
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,790
Will you keep making me feel uncomfortable?

234
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,950
Is it my fault that Yoon Mi Ra and Jeong Won are in a relationship?

235
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,790
I did end it with her, as promised with you.

236
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,910
Promise?

237
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Did you not remember our marriage promise when you were having a fling with that woman?

238
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,930
Our promise to be loyal to each other!

239
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,460
Didn't that mean anything?

240
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,420
Of course, you should pay for what you've done.

241
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,210
But me, why should I?

242
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,610
Why the hell? Why should I bear all this?

243
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,870
Why, why? Why?

244
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,290
- Seon Joo. 
 - My Jeong Won...

245
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,970
wants to marry Yoon Mi Ra.

246
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,470
I have to stop their marriage.

247
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,400
So... you...

248
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,450
You should do whatever you can.

249
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,840
I am grateful for yesterday.

250
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:07,170
How did you meet Yoon Mi Ra?

251
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,880
What?

252
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,620
Because of Victoria shoes...

253
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,070
Victoria shoes...?

254
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,190
She had saved me from a difficult situation.

255
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,960
Where does she live?

256
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,630
She lives in the same apartments as me, one floor below.

257
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:49,450
Don't you have anything to say to me, by any chance?

258
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,870
What do you mean? What do you want to hear?

259
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,410
About Mi Ra.

260
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,420
Actually...

261
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,390
I have something to tell you.

262
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,510
What is it?

263
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:28,240
Victoria's designer is Yoon Mi Ra.

264
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,030
What?

265
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,150
Victoria's designer is Mi Ra?

266
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,780
Yeah.

267
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,270
Then, why didn't she tell me?

268
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,630
We had something bad happen with Yeongwon Leather, so the contract was terminated with our company.

269
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,730
Two years ago.

270
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,940
Actually, we parted badly back then.

271
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,270
Even though they are back to subcontracting.

272
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,650
That doesn't mean our feelings towards each other have settled.

273
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,110
I see.

274
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,170
That's why it was that awkward yesterday.

275
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,670
Give me a moment.

276
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,970
It's Seon Joo.

277
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,730
Yeah, Seon Joo. I am with Brother-in-Law right now.

278
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,470
Seon Joo.

279
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,390
You're here.

280
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,410
It's been a long time, Yeon Joo.

281
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,640

282
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,950
Have you been well?

283
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,380
Jeong Won.

284
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,230
You are a special sibling to me.

285
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,480
I know.

286
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,790
During the last year of elementary school...

287
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,210
Suddenly one day, Father brought home a young boy.

288
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,040
And said you were my brother.

289
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,410
Since then,

290
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,070
Mom and Dad fought always.

291
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,530
The atmosphere at home was always terrible.

292
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:05,650
But we still cared for and depended on each other.

293
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,180
We continued to live like that.

294
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:17,580
And then Yeon Joo died. Whenever I was troubled by that,

295
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,580
you gave me strength and comforted me.

296
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,390
You were my only family.

297
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,290
Seon Joo.

298
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,940
Jeong Won.

299
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,290
Break up with Yoon Mi Ra.

300
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,430
I just don't understand,

301
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,720
why you're telling me to break up with Mi Ra.

302
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,510
I don't think it's because of work stuff like Brother-in-Law said.

303
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,150
What is it? The real reason?

304
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,030
That woman, Yoon Mi Ra...

305
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,100
was a mistress in a relationship with a married man.

306
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,540
- What? 
- And...

307
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,250
And...

308
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,060
she got pregnant with that man's child.

309
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,500
I was...

310
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,930
someone who was not supposed to be born.

311
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,820
Stepmother, Yeon Joo,

312
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,360
and you...

313
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,180
would have suffered and struggled

314
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,800
by being reminded of Father's infidelity every time you saw me.

315
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,240
Jeong Won.

316
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,550
But even then, thanks to you

317
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,710
caring for me and embracing me,

318
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,520
I was able to live until now.

319
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:49,380
To someone like me... Someone who despised the idea of marriage...

320
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,830
The first woman who I've ever wanted to marry... is Mi Ra.

321
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,710
Are you really being like this... because you don't know how I feel?

322
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,290
I know very well that you are worried about me.

323
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,730
But... I can't give up on Mi Ra.

324
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,560
Get it together Han Jeong Won! That woman is a mistress!

325
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,870
I'm an illegitimate child!

326
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,870
A bastard and a mistress...

327
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,460
are a pair that suit each other.

328
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,150
Han Jeong Won!

329
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,260
I have nothing to be so confident about either.

330
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,990
Compared to Mi Ra, I have nothing to be proud of.

331
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,830
To put it bluntly, it's not like she was cheating with Brother-in-Law or anything.

332
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,850
It's all in the past.

333
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,370
The one who Mi Ra loves now...

334
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,090
is not that married man,

335
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,700
but me, Han Jeong Won.

336
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,890
Sis...

337
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,480
I... love Mi Ra.

338
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,460
I love her.

339
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,230
I saw Jeong Won's girlfriend.

340
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,700
After looking forward to seeing a woman that would truly love Jeong Won,

341
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,660
you must have been happy.

342
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,960
Happy?

343
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,840
I'm losing my mind.

344
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,360
The woman he brought saying he's in love with

345
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,310
is Shin Myeong Seop's mistress!

346
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,050
Isn't that just hilarious?

347
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,620
- What are you talking about? 
 - I said Jeong Won's lover

348
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,080
is my husband's,

349
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,520
Shin Myeong Seop's, mistress.

350
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,590
Does Jeong Won know this?

351
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,140
He doesn't know.

352
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,170
Jeong Won was happy, saying he had found a woman that he loves for the first time in his life.

353
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,700
I couldn't bring myself to look him in the eyes and say,

354
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,340
"The woman you love

355
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,310
is your brother-in-law's mistress."

356
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,900
I just couldn't.

357
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,820
What can I do for you?

358
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,300
How can I help?

359
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:54,740
You can just... cheer me on.

360
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,840
So that I don't falter.

361
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,210
So that I can push through to the end.

362
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,060
Mi Ra...

363
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,520
You said you wouldn't be like this. You need to live your life.

364
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,730
I'm living my life right now! What do you mean?

365
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,670
We were happy.

366
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,430
Do you really have to shatter our good memories as well?

367
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,760
We were happy. Until you betrayed me.

368
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,650
Before our baby died...

369
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,420
nothing was bad.

370
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,980
We were just going at different speeds.

371
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,840
I wanted to walk with you, but you were speeding.

372
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,240
That's the only reason it didn't work out.

373
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,310
You know.

374
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,120
That my feelings for you were always genuine.

375
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,160
I still remember your words.

376
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,990
That I was the only one who understands you and made you shine.

377
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,170
Your words that you loved me more than your life.

378
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,280
I still believe that.

379
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,300
So, Mi Ra,

380
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,540
let's stop here.

381
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,040
Stay here for a second.

382
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,310
What brings you here? Didn't you say you had a meeting tonight?

383
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,080
I didn't go.

384
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,690
Jeong Won...

385
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,770
is something wrong?

386
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,260
All this time,

387
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:39,220
you suffered and struggled a lot, didn't you?

388
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,000
Now, be happy with me.

389
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,960
For coming to me,

390
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,480
for being my love,

391
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,690
thank you so much.

392
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,120
As expected, the only one who understands me

393
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,820
and makes me shine, is you, Han Jeong Won.

394
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,580
I love you. I love you more than my life.

395
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,780
Do you want to play a game of chess with me?

396
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,050
Why the black pieces?

397
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,340
You always played with the white pieces.

398
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,640
Sometimes I need to see the board from the view of the opposite side.

399
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,650
You saw Yoon Mi Ra, didn't you?

400
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,840
Yeah.

401
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,910
What did she say?

402
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,520
She said she loves Jeong Won,

403
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,810
very deeply.

404
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,700
I knew it.

405
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,870
What about you?

406
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,340
About what?

407
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,130
How do you feel?

408
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,690
It's all in the past.

409
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,050
Don't talk about useless things.

410
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,420
Protect it well.

411
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,470
Protect what?

412
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,280
Checkmate.

413
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,000
Your king...

414
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,680
- Who are we meeting? 
 - My sister.

415
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,890
Seon Joo said she wanted to meet us?

416
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:33,380
She said I had to come out with you.

417
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm curious about what she will say.

418
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,950
I'm curious, too.

419
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm also a little scared.

420
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,100
Sis.

421
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,000
- Did you wait for long? 
 - No, we just got here.

422
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,670
It must have caught you off guard that I reached out so suddenly, Mi Ra.

423
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,240
Not at all! If you call, I should come running anyway.

424
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,530
What is it that you have to say to us?

425
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:00,140
The two of you... are people that I love,

426
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,460
and like,

427
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,140
but since I know more than anyone

428
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,310
the extent of your pasts and pain,

429
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,870
I have many concerns.

430
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,610
Could the two of you, as scarred as you are, become one?

431
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,890
Could you form a happy home?

432
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,220
I pondered again and again.

433
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,760
The conclusion I came to after my deep contemplation is...

434
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,340
I will give you two permission to marry.

435
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,770
Sis!

436
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,850
Mi Ra!

437
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,660
What do you think, Mi Ra?

438
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,280
- Huh? 
 - Are you happy?

439
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,530
Of course, I'm happy!

440
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,570
I was just so surprised, that I lost my words for a second.

441
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,640
This is my gift for you.

442
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,250
A gift?

443
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,040
What is this?

444
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,690
The house next door has been empty for a while, so I bought it.

445
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,360
You two should...

446
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,840
live next door to me.

447
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:03,540
Mi Ra, you are also a lonely person without a family.

448
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,720
I'll become your older sister and family.

449
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,250
Please sit, sit.

450
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,420
I apologize for suddenly asking you guys to come out like this.

451
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,390
Not at all! Whenever you call, we should run over.

452
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,840
That... thing I spoke to you about last time,

453
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,410
Please see it through starting tomorrow.

454
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,820
Yes, understood.

455
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,450
It's being carried out faster than I expected.

456
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,520
So, Seon Joo's husband, Shin Myeong Seop,

457
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,800
is pushing for a merger with your company?

458
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,710
What do you mean Shin Myeong Seop?

459
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:23,050
It's President Shin Myeong Seop.

460
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,690
He's our boss! So go treat Han Seon Joo well too.

461
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,620
My pride is hurt...

462
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,370
LaReine is what's stopping our company from going bankrupt!

463
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,840
Royal Empire's rank just got more and more definite.

464
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,260
That woman is the queen,

465
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,440
and I'm a maid forever...

466
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,450
LaReine Group's partner law firm?

467
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,320
Yeah, our leash

468
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,750
is now being held by that house.

469
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,430
Whether we prosper or go under is in that woman's hands.

470
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:08,280
So lay down flat and roll like the tongue in your mouth. To Han Seon Joo.

471
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,760
I am already serving him, you want me to go lower than this?

472
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:19,260
Seon Joo, the house is so pretty and nice.

473
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,200
Is it?

474
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,340
Mi Ra, do you like the interior?

475
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,520
Yes.

476
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,200
That's a relief. I was worried about what I would do if it didn't appeal to your tastes.

477
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,380
Seon Joo, thank you so much.

478
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,180
As long as you and Mi Ra are happy, that's enough for me.

479
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,230
Oh wow, Mi Ra?

480
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,580
Mi Ra, are you moving in here?

481
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,210
I'll introduce you. This is my younger brother, Han Jeong Won.

482
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,280
He's your younger brother?

483
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,600
Seon Joo's younger brother? How heart-warming! You're so handsome!

484
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,160
Hello, nice to meet you.

485
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,090
Nice to meet you!

486
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,280
You resemble Seon Joo so much!

487
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,310
But, Mi Ra, why are you next to him?

488
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,800
My younger brother and Mi Ra are getting married.

489
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,150
- What? 
 - What?

490
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:29,400
Wha-Wh-What? M-M-Marriage?

491
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,180
It seems like we'll be seeing each other often. Please take care of me.

492
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:37,630
- Ah, yes. 
 - Ahh... yes.

493
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,490
Jeong Won, let's head inside. We need to organize our luggage.

494
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,910
Shall we?

495
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,830
See you next time.

496
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,620
We'll go inside, Sister.

497
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,950
I'll go inside as well.

498
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,540
- What is going on? 
 - Oh my goodness!  What is this about?

499
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,410
What are you doing?

500
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,750
What do you mean?

501
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,620
Making Yoon Mi Ra and Jeong Won move next door?

502
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,700
Or permitting their marriage?

503
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,610
Both of those don't make sense.

504
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,720
How can you accept Yoon Mi Ra?

505
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,900
When did I?

506
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,340
I never accepted Yoon Mi Ra.

507
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,570
Then?

508
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:55,210
Because you are not doing anything, I did this to save myself.

509
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,410
My brother and my family.

510
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,760
I will protect them.

511
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,010
You also know it, right?

512
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,650
Yoon Mi Ra's target is not Jeong Won.

513
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,370
All of this is happening because of you.

514
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,800
Don't forget that.

515
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,730
We should live happily.

516
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,390
Yes.

517
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,060
You are hungry, right? I'll make your favorite pasta.

518
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,720
It's all right.

519
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,980
We haven't unpacked yet and it's still messy.

520
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,310
It doesn't take long, so just wait a little.

521
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,860
Here you go.

522
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,990
I will try it. 
 ♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

523
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:03,330
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

524
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:07,630
♫  If you are still there  ♫

525
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,020
♫  The bright lights of this city  ♫

526
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,310
♫  My footsteps have been erased  ♫

527
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:20,770
♫  Hearing your presence  ♫

528
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,040
♫  The unspoken screams get louder  ♫

529
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:31,310
♫  On the streets where even the gods left  ♫

530
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:34,830
♫  What kind of justice? What is the standard?  ♫

531
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,120
♫  Shall I hold your hand?  ♫

532
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,710
♫  No one knows  ♫

533
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,090
♫  If you can still hear me  ♫

534
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,750
♫  If I have your heart  ♫

535
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,920
Come on in.

536
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,760
Thank you for inviting us.

537
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,580
Welcome.

538
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,570
Uncle. Aunt.

539
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,450
Welcome to the...

540
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,490
Royal Empire.

541
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,840
We are in your care.

542
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,470
Yes.

543
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,920
I am happy that we're neighbors.

544
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,350
Me too.

545
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,560
I am happy that you are living together next to me.

546
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,370
Uncle, eat the chicken quickly.

547
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,560
Oh yes. Let's eat.

548
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,550
Here.

549
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,410
This is Tae Hee's favorite flavor.

550
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,260
This is Tae Yong's.

551
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,460
Eat well.

552
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,580
Seon Joo.

553
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,730
Brother-in-Law.

554
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:03,980
- Mi Ra. 
 - Thank you.

555
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,020
Thank you.

556
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,740
I will go to the bathroom real quick.

557
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:22,200
Oh yes! What should we gift grandmother for her birthday next week?

558
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,310
It's hard to choose a birthday gift for grandma.

559
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,600
Seon Joo, shall we buy a bracelet for our mom's birthday?

560
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,990
We have never gone on a family trip before.

561
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:56,220
- Grandma. 
 - Grandma.

562
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,880
My puppies are here!

563
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,140
Hello.

564
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,590
Yes.

565
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,290
- Uncle. 
 - Hi.

566
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,630
Let's go in quickly.

567
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,990
Lose that expression on your face.

568
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:38,050
Let's not fight today. It's Mother-in-Law's birthday.

569
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:45,840
Does Jeong Won have some other intention?

570
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,870
Why did he suggest a family trip suddenly?

571
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,950
Not everyone lives with an intention like you.

572
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,930
I am Yoon Mi Ra.

573
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:14,210
I should have come to see you and introduced myself sooner.

574
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,430
This is good enough.

575
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:27,460
Actually, Mi Ra was the one who suggested a family trip.

576
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,560
Mom, please take care of Mi Ra.

577
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,130
That... I should wait and see.

578
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,350
Will you not feel uncomfortable?

579
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,290
The first meeting with the Chairman is a family trip.

580
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,450
Everything for the first time feels awkward and uncomfortable.

581
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,020
Meeting each other often will bring us closer.

582
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:09,970

583
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:39,950
Han Seon Joo, you are under arrest for the attempted murder of Yoon Mi Ra.

584
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:46,630
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

585
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:53,380
♫  for you to see I’m no company  ♫

586
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:02,060
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

587
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:09,420
♫  I guess you don't know that. I guess how I feel  ♫

588
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:17,770
♫  I bet my love can't compensate no more  ♫

589
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:23,500
♫  I think all that’s in my head has been replaced somehow  ♫

590
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,810

♫  My god I feel the open wounds come back to me  ♫

591
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,070
 Yoon Mi Ra, will you marry me?

592
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:33,530
 If you become Jeong Won's wife, you'll be caught in a trap.

593
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,770
 But how long do I have to hold back?

594
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,180
 Please don't leave me like this.

595
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,730
 You know that, in the end, you'll be the one next to me.

596
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,300
 I will not give you a divorce.

597
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:48,900
 They'll disintegrate, LaReine Group and our family. Is that what you want?

598
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,710
 Go to hell.

599
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,310
 I really considered you to be my own sister.

600
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,540
 What are you planning?

601
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,860
 That man will never divorce me as long as he works at LaReine.

602
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:03,520
 Shin Myeong Seop does not want a divorce, not me.

603
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,420
 Let's make a deal.

604
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:10,800
♫  I’ve loved someone like I could never love again  ♫
