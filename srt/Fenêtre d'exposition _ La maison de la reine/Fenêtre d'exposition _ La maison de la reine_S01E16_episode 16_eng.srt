1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
 I, Yoon Mi Ra, wanted to live a brighter and more passionate life than anyone else in the world. But I realized that everything was useless and empty. I no longer have the strength

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,620
 or courage to keep going, so I've decided to leave everything behind and leave. I sincerely ask for forgiveness for the last time from those who knew me and hated me. Goodbye... Yoon Mi Ra

3
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,370

4
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,330
Mi Ra! Mi Ra!

5
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,920
Mi Ra! Please wake up, Mi Ra!

6
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,870
Yoon Mi Ra. Please...

7
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,160

8
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,270
 Your call cannot be connected and you will be forwarded to voicemail...

9
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,750
What's going on?

10
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,620
 Things didn't go as planned.

11
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,630
- Are you Yoon Mi Ra's guardian? 
 - Yes.

12
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,790
Please take care of the billing first, thank you.

13
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,760
Why didn't you take care of things properly?

14
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,870
I was surprised, too.

15
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,690
Why Team Leader Han Jeong Won didn't come but instead...

16
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,270
 Take care of it.

17
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,010
What should we do?

18
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,200
Seeing that things turned out this way,

19
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm sure you know very well

20
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,360
what you should do.

21
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,670
 Wait!

22
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,860
 Who is this woman?

23
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,580
 Why is Han Seon Joo here?

24
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,840
 Are you certain you sent the text to Han Jeong Won?!

25
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,000
 I-I'm sure I sent it to him.

26
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,560
 You were going to...

27
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,690
 kill Jeong Won?

28
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,130
 Who hired you?

29
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,510
 Was it Shin Myeong Seop?

30
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,620
 Do you trust...

31
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,580
 Shin Myeong Seop?

32
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,150
 Shin Myeong Seop tried to

33
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,860
 kill Yoon Mi Ra.

34
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,690
 Pardon?

35
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,610
 The one who stabbed your niece, Yoon Mi Ra,

36
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,010
 is Shin Myeong Seop.

37
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,230
 That's the kind of person

38
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,730
 Shin Myeong Seop is.

39
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,750
 If anyone stands in his way, no matter who it is,

40
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,380
 he's someone who's able to

41
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,950
 get rid of them.

42
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,110
 Do you think you're any different?

43
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,280
 When you know all of Shin Myeong Seop's dirty flaws?

44
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,400
 I'm sure you won't...

45
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,970
 be safe either.

46
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,140
 Never.

47
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
 From now on,

48
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,200
 I will buy you both.

49
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,660
 Whatever Shin Myeong Seop promised to pay you,

50
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,090
 I'll give you triple.

51
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,550
What...

52
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,060
What are you doing right now?

53
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,150
Seon Joo.

54
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,450
Why are you doing this to me?

55
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,130
I'll ask you the same, why did you do that to me?

56
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,010
Do what?

57
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,220
Was my love for you not enough?

58
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,300
Was my devotion to you

59
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,510
not enough?

60
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,420
Why the hell...

61
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,020
Why did you betray me?

62
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,800
It was because of Yoon Mi Ra.

63
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,360
Everything was... because of Yoon Mi Ra.

64
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,520
How she approached me from the beginning

65
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,010
was all a part of her plan.

66
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,080
Honey, you remember, don't you?

67
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,240
When you came back to Seoul alone from Yeosu Airport?

68
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,940
Actually, at that time...

69
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,150
Yoon Mi Ra tried to kill herself saying that she'd rather die than be without me.

70
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,120
You also know well how strange she is,

71
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,310
how obsessed she was with me.

72
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,240
Why else would she have made her moves on Jeong Won, too, huh?

73
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,370
That woman... isn't in her right mind.

74
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,590
She's a stalker. A mental patient!

75
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,350
So...

76
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,920
you're not at fault at all?

77
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,130
No...

78
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,830
But... if you were to pinpoint the one who is at fault,

79
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,030
Yoon Mi Ra is more guilty than I am!

80
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,810
Seriously...

81
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,360
you are always...

82
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,570
cowardly and despicable.

83
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,340
Seon Joo, please believe me.

84
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,560
Everything I just told you is the truth.

85
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,830
The truth?

86
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,350
Is that why you killed Yoon Mi Ra?

87
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,690
That...

88
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,950
That was an accident.

89
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,420
We were fighting...

90
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,380
and I accidentally...

91
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,850
Then what about Jeong Won?

92
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,880
Terrorizing Jeong Won by luring him out?

93
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,390
What do you mean, terrorizing my brother-in-law?

94
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,410
I don't know anything about that.

95
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,240
You don't know?

96
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,800
No.

97
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,590
I don't know.

98
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,570
Seon Joo, let's really start over again.

99
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,970
You and I, our kids, we can be as happy as we want again!

100
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,550
Yoon Mi Ra doesn't exist anymore, so...

101
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,190
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

102
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,600
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

103
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,100
You...

104
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,940
Why are you so shocked?

105
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,020
It's like you saw a ghost.

106
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
How are you...

107
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,600
♫  Anything is fine  ♫

108
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:13,160
♫  The bright lights of this city, my footsteps have been erased  ♫

109
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,550
♫  Hearing your presence  ♫

110
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,410
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget

111
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,870
that cold look in your eyes when you stabbed me with this knife.

112
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,030
♫  On the streets where even the gods left  ♫

113
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,570
♫  What kind of justice? What is the standard?  ♫

114
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,820
♫  Shall I hold your hand? ♫

115
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,080
♫  No one knows  ♫

116
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,920
♫  Hello... Hello  ♫

117
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:55,550
♫  If you can still hear me, if I have your heart  ♫

118
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,290
Do you think Seon Joo is okay?

119
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,320
In the end, everything got shattered.

120
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,690
We meet again.

121
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,870
During the time of the incident,

122
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,000
by chance, did you see Yoon Mi Ra in the neighborhood

123
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,700
or at Han Seon Joo's home?

124
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,090
No, I didn't.

125
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,530
I don't know, since I went to bed early.

126
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,370
What, me?

127
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,970
Well, I don't know. Not at all. Nothing.

128
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,970
Fine, I understand.

129
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,960
If by chance you remember anything that might help with the investigation,

130
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,990
please contact me.

131
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,230
Then, goodbye.

132
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,730
 Christine.

133
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,810
 David!

134
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,290
 I've decided to start exercising too, from today.

135
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,780
 I'm going to do everything together with you from now on.

136
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,040
 "Together" is a nice word.

137
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,080
 Should we take a photo to celebrate our togetherness?

138
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,120
 Shall we?

139
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,840
 - Let's go. 
 - Shall we?

140
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,240
Yoon Mi Ra.

141
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,050
Yoon Mi Ra?

142
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:04,190
Did you stab and kill Shin Myeong Seop?

143
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,490
Yes.

144
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,070
What's the reason?

145
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,010
Why did you do it?

146
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,070
I tried to kill Han Seon Joo.

147
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,780
What did you... just say?

148
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,820
The one I was going to kill wasn't Shin Myeong Seop,

149
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,210
but Han Seon Joo.

150
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,180
By getting rid of that woman,

151
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,190
I was going to make that man all mine.

152
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,060
But at the last moment...

153
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,490
he...

154
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,100
in place of Han Seon Joo...

155
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,170
I never expected it.

156
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,310
It was a mistake.

157
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:46,140
Is it true that Yoon Mi Ra killed Shin Myeong Seop?

158
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,290
 I will do it.

159
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,180
 Let's do it together.

160
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,010
 No.

161
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,550
 Because I started it,

162
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,920
 I want to end it myself.

163
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,870
 If I can't kill him myself then I will regret it forever.

164
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,450
 So please let me do it.

165
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,040
 Please.

166
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,000
 I beg of you.

167
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,380
According to Yoon Mi Ra's statement,

168
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,890
she was trying to attack you but Shin Myeong Seop suddenly

169
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,360
jumped in and got stabbed instead.

170
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,250
Is that true?

171
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,530
Han Seon Joo.

172
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,720
What are you looking at?

173
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,450
This knife. This is exactly

174
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,690
the knife that was used to stab Yoon Mi Ra.

175
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,940
The knife that we were desperately looking for

176
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,550
suddenly showed up and it was used to kill Shin Myeong Seop.

177
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,780
Where could this knife have been, all this while?

178
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,790

179
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,370
"My husband, Shin Myeong Seop,

180
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,900
was a talented, competent, and honest businessman.

181
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,600
He was the perfect and the best husband.

182
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,490
And to our children,

183
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,420
he was like a kind friend

184
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,690
and proud father."

185
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,420
"Because of the noble sacrifice of my husband, Shin Myeong Seop,

186
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,180
I...

187
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,200
am alive here today."

188
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,040
"I never could have imagined that

189
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,580
the moment of parting, that seemed like it would never come,

190
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,240
has happened to our family this soon."

191
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,400
"In unbearable sadness,

192
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,100
everything feels like it's collapsing,

193
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,880
but my family and I will make it out of this."

194
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,920
Honey.

195
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,320
Goodbye.

196
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,480
We are the audit team. Please stop working.

197
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,400
After what happened to Chairman Shin Myeong Seop, I expected a day like this to come.

198
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,900
I didn't know that a major purge would start so quickly.

199
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,340
The next chairman will probably be Han Jeong Won, right?

200
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,150
I should leave LaReine even if it's now.

201
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,310
But it's not like you're not going to find a job.

202
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,600
You will be able to find something as a lawyer, but if I get fired at this age...

203
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Seriously, I'm going crazy...

204
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,600
Should we go to Han Seon Joo and work something out?

205
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,680
That would be crazy.

206
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,340
We did everything along with Chairman Shin Myeong Seop.

207
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,110
Han Seon Joo knows everything, do you think she would hear us out?

208
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,150
There's no way out of this.

209
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,300

210
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,980
What do I do?

211
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,290
Yes.

212
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,460
What?

213
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,090
Yes, sir.

214
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,120
What did he say?

215
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,730
He asked to meet him.

216
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,800
You have worked hard till now.

217
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,840
He wants both of us to come.

218
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,280
You too.

219
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,450
Me too?

220
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,980
Yes.

221
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,950
Oh.. hello.

222
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,330
Please sit here.

223
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,320
Why did you want to meet?

224
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,560
All this while...

225
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,100
I had a personal project going on.

226
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,780
I see. What about it?

227
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,460
I want the two of you to handle this project.

228
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,440
Didn't you call us here to fire us?

229
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,610
What?

230
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,720
Isn't there a major purge going on right now?

231
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,460
Aren't you firing everyone who worked for the late Chairman Shin Myeong Seop?

232
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,610
It looks like there is a misunderstanding.

233
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,740
It is true that the company's audit team is conducting extensive due diligence.

234
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:48,570
However, it is only preliminary for renewal and reform,

235
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,060
not a retaliatory audit.

236
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,600
Why would I fire you two when you are capable people?

237
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,110
Will you handle the project?

238
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,000
Of course.

239
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,100
We will do our best to succeed.

240
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,710
We will do our best.

241
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,520
Yoon Mi Ra doesn't have any family members or relatives that would do this for her...

242
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,490
Who requested it?

243
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,960
Han Jeong Won.

244
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,740
Han Seon Joo's younger brother, Han Jeong Won?

245
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,250
Yoon Mi Ra intended to kill Han Seon Joo, though.

246
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,000
Are you saying that Han Jeong Won requested a lawyer for her?

247
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,520
Yes. He might hate and resent Yoon Mi Ra now,

248
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,690
but... he must have not been able to turn his back on her.

249
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,070
From Han Jeong Won's perspective.

250
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,580
I am an attorney, Ahn Do Hyeok.

251
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,750
I have been appointed to represent you.

252
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,800
I don't need it.

253
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,500
I don't need a lawyer.

254
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,710
Excuse me, Yoon Mi Ra...

255
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,460
I said I don't need it.

256
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,300
This is a collaborative project with Pendex in the United States.

257
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,790
If we succeed in signing a partnership contract with Pendex,

258
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:00,060
LaReine is expected to see over a 30% increase in sales as a whole.

259
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,590
Carry out the project.

260
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,810
Yes, ma'am.

261
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,450
Team Leader Han.

262
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,250
Yes, Chairwoman.

263
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,040
I quite like these shoes.

264
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:44,420
They're comfortable while being pretty, but above all,

265
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,680
I can see the thought and consideration that went towards their wearer.

266
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,720
Try full-scale manufacturing this product,

267
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,710
and creating a Silver Line.

268
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,270
Why? Do you think you will be tired from the new project?

269
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,750
No.

270
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,220
I will try, no... I can do it.

271
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,460
Looking at the view from up here,

272
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,710
I think that now

273
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,220
things have truly come to an end.

274
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,120
5340, get up!

275
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,390
53!

276
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,830
5340! 5340!

277
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,660
 Sis, Yoon Mi Ra...

278
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:15,090
The funeral went well.

279
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,200
I heard that you refused a lawyer.

280
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,950
I don't want to be defended.

281
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,040
I don't have the right to be defended.

282
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,980
Do you regret it?

283
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,200
Yes, I regret it.

284
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,320
Loving Shin Myeong Seop...

285
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,590
and all of the happy moments... I regret them.

286
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,710
I was selfish.

287
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,630
My love alone was pathetic,

288
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,260
and my love alone was precious.

289
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:17,190
I thought that I would be happy smashing someone else's fence and entering...

290
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,080
But ahead of that,

291
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,950
was hell.

292
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,330
I,

293
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,230
who deeply shook up and shattered

294
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,730
your family and life,

295
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,660
find myself so pathetic.

296
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,770
So I should accept that punishment.

297
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,600
Allow me to die with the crime I committed.

298
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,130
So that I can at least keep my last bit of honor.

299
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,900
Do you remember when we met in Yeosu?

300
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,060
The legend of Geumodo Island.

301
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:51,170
A girl from Heaven came to the island to play and came to love a human...

302
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,380
And when the Great Jade Emperor found out,

303
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,690
he separated the girl and the human,

304
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,970
and locked them up on mountaintops in opposite directions.

305
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,370
A punishment from Heaven,

306
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,690
the price for the sin of a mistaken love.

307
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,830
You should accept it, as well.

308
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,670
Pay the price for your sin of mistaken love.

309
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,800
Don't die, accept your punishment while alive.

310
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,950
Don't run away, either.

311
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,660
From now on,

312
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,910
restart living your life, that has been set back on track.

313
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,630
This is the punishment that I will give to you.

314
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,030

315
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,310

316
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,660
Yeong Hoon, it's me.

317
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,310
The favor I asked about before,

318
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,100
please do it.

319
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,350
 Last time, I told you

320
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,190
 that I had a favor to ask.

321
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,210
 Yoon Mi Ra...

322
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,300
 will be put on trial.

323
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,850
 If you were to help her,

324
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,490
 I would appreciate it.

325
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,250
 Help me, Yeong Hoon.

326
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,570
 All right.

327
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,190
 I will do everything I can.

328
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,200
 Thank you, Seon Joo.

329
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,700
 For letting me be someone who can help you again.

330
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,670

331
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,280
Everyone...

332
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:16,000
has a secret or two that they want to hide.

333
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:57,110
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

334
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:04,820

336
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,400
♫  I guess you don't know that  ♫

337
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,290
♫   I guess how I feel  ♫

338
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:28,290

339

354
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,990

355
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,510
Aren't you bored?

356
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:48,190
I don't have time to be bored.

357
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:53,430
Well, you don't know how to stay at home for even one day.

358
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,690
There are more than a few things that I missed out on while working all that time.

359
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,240
I'm so busy.

360
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,340
Must be nice.

361
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,570
But... are you okay?

362
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,350
Me?

363
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,970
Of course, I'm fine.

364
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,890
You came?

365
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,920
Sorry for being late.

366
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,130
It's hard to meet such a high-ranked person.

367
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,860
At this rate, I'll forget the face of my one and only son!

368
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,860
Sorry...

369
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,470
You've got so much going for you, but you have no sense of humor.

370
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,470
You can't keep up with a joke.

371
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,650
My future daughter-in-law will be so frustrated.

372
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,540
It's the kids!

373
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,450
 Grandma, Mom, ciao!

374
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,880
Are my puppies doing well?

375
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,220
We miss you, Grandma.

376
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,520
Hey, Tae Hee and Tae Yong, good to see ya!

377
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,690
Uncle... you still say "good to see ya"?

378
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,140
What? It's warm and nice.

379
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,950
Oh right! Grandma, I sent you a New Year's gift.

380
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:14,990
A gift? What could it be? I'm excited!

381
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,470
Thanks!

382
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,490
- And my gift? 
 - Wow.

383
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,640
Great Chairman of LaReine Group, you're too mean!

384
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,090
You're asking for a gift from your nephew who is studying abroad.

385
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,300
Don't skip any meals!

386
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,640
Okay, you too, Mom.

387
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,890
 - Mom.  
 - Grandma and Uncle.

388
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:35,890
 Arrivederla! 
(T/N: Goodbye in Italian)

389
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,050
Bye.

390
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,360
- Let's go and eat, too. 
 - Okay.

391
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,900
The two of you have a cherished meal together as mother and son.

392
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,550
I have somewhere that I need to go.

393
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,780
- Mushrooms... 
 - Take your pick! They are all in good shape.

394
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,990
What about the apples?

395
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,900
- Apples? 
 - Yes.

396
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,480
Well, for apples...

397
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,990
Then... just give me 10,000 won.

398
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,990
That's expensive.

399
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,440
I have given this place so much business, let me have a discount!

400
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,480
If anyone heard you, they would think you bought a massive amount!

401
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Since I know that you, young lady, are doing good work,

402
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,140
I kept aside all the quality items and gave them to you.

403
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,390
I know. I am always appreciative.

404
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,530
So please treat me well in the future, too. Okay?

405
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,070
Don't worry.

406
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,630
Welcome! Take a look.

407
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,860
You look good.

408
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,960
I have been going to counseling sessions with Dr. Cha Yeong Hoon once a month.

409
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,950
I lived thanks to you caring about me.

410
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:26,270
You took all of the blame and left me out of it.

411
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,690
Of course, I should have.

412
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:33,130
There's nothing definite in this world.

413
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:40,820
I think you're receiving the punishment that I gave you well.

414
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,910
I feel relieved.

415
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:50,020
I know that you gave me that punishment to save me.

416
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,140
Thanks to you, I found a new life.

417
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,840
From now on, I will live while continuing to reflect on

418
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,510
the punishment you gave me.

419
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,850
There's something that I was never able to say.

420
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,430
I'm sorry.

421
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:41,750
And... thank you.

422
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,400
You look comfortable, too.

423
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,700
Since I've taken off high heels for good,

424
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,050
I've gotten a lot more comfortable.

425
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:33,370
In the past, I think I tried to protect too much.

426
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:42,430
I wasted my life showing off for others.

427
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,000
Now, I realize for the first time

428
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,420
how much I put myself through.

429
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,410
Since I came to acknowledge and accept myself as I am,

430
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,820
I feel comfortable and free.

431
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:21,880
I'm really going to live for myself now.

432
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,900
Can we see each other again?

433

442

443
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,110
 Look and smile.

444
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,000
 Oh my god! I am shooting a love scene today.

445
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,650
 Then with your hand...

446
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,900
 Hold on, isn't he a bad guy?

447
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,640
 With your skirt lifted– That's better.

448
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,390
 Oh my god.

449
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:14,320
 It's awkward.

450
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,770
 This woman is a mistress who steals another woman's man.

451
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,670
 Why are you taking her side when you don't even know?

452
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,510
 - I know, I know.  
 - Is that so?

453
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,050
 I will update the group chat.

454
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,100
 Who is it?

455
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,260
 Victoria's designer.

456
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,860
 Me.

457
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,980
 Oh, web designer.

458
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,640
 I really want to meet that person.

459
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,550
 What kind of couples always talk like this?

460
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,940
 Hey, I was back but you came up.

461
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:07,030
 1, 2.

462
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,890
 1, 2.

463
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:09,650
 1, 2.

464
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,200
 - Please let me love him. 
 - Do you want to do this?

465
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,630
 That's nice. Okay.

466
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:15,800
 1, 2.

467
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,390
 Thank you!

468
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:21,630
 Thank you. Thank you.

469
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,390
 Send this to me.

470
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,930
 Please send it.

471
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:09,500
 I sincerely thank everyone who

472
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,480
 loved and watched the Show Window: Queen's House.

473
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,140
 I think it was worthwhile working hard

474
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,860
 and shooting while having fun.

475
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,590
 Thank you for giving a lot of love to Show Window: The Queen's House.

476
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,310
 Because all of you loved it,

477
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,820
 we were able to shoot with much strength.

478
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,660
 For loving Show Window so much–

479
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,240
 I think it was a happy and grateful time.

480
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,520
 It was really fun.

481
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,190
 This year too, I hope that everything

482
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:38,470
 that you wish for comes to reality.

483
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:43,790
 I will always cheer for all the families' love and peace.

484
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,870
 Viewers! In 2022 too,

485
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:47,040
 Happy New

486
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,220
 Happy New

487
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,720
 Happy New Year!

488
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,600
 Thank you so much to the viewers who have loved Show Window: The Queen's House.
