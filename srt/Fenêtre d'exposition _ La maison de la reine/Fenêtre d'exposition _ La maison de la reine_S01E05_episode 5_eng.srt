1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,950

In life, you don't know what's just around the corner.

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,330
Who knew something this horrible could happen to Han Seon Joo?

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,560
People say they want the truth.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,760
But in reality, they want lies that are like truths.

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,730
Kill or die...

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,000
That's probably the only escape route in this war.

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,830
Yeah.

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,580
Yoon Mi Ra is still in surgery.

9
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:58,030
Ms. Han Seon Joo, did you stab Yoon Mi Ra with a knife?

10
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,940
No.

11
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,800
Someone witnessed you at the scene of Yoon Mi Ra's injury.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,550
You were even holding the weapon,

13
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,520
but you didn't do it?

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,450
Will it be bodily injury resulting in death or just injury...?

15
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,910
Ms. Han, exactly what happened?

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,550
Ms. Han Seon Joo!

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,200
Where...

18
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,570
should I start...

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,530
and how...?

20
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:59,330

21
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:06,270

22
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,030
Can I borrow some makeup?

23
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,400
Pardon?

24
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,390
Oh... okay.

25
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,480

26
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,440
In closing, LaReine Group

27
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,360
has put on new wings. I, Shin Myeong Seop,

28
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,500
in order to make this group into the world's best,

29
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,060
will keep on challenging and make effort without rest.

30
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,670
I ask for everyone's well wishes

31
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,560
and support so that our LaReine can soar higher.

32
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,310
Thank you.

33
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,530
For the commemorative cake cutting, I ask my life's companion

34
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,990
and my forever partner, Chairman of Haesol Foundation, Han Seon Joo, to join me.

35
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
Honey.

36
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,770
Where has she gone? She's been gone since earlier.

37
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,910
I'll go look for her.

38
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,770
Mom is right there.

39
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,850

40
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,560

41
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,900
I'll have you over one of these days.

42
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,290
The weather's been good, too.

43
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you really feeling unwell?

44
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,130
Yeah, unwell.

45
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,140
How and where are you sick? Maybe you should go to the hospital.

46
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,520
I'll take care of it myself.

47
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,270
Anyway, you did a great job.  Thanks!

48
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,670
Also, I think I need to go for a second round with some of the people.

49
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,910
Go to bed first. Don't wait up.

50
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,280
 Look here, Han Seon Joo. The woman of Shin Myeong Seop's life

51
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,180
 is only you.

52
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,340
 I'm more grateful.

53
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,690
 Since you're my wife.

54
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,850
Mi Ra!  Yoon Mi Ra!

55
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,700
President Shin Myeng Seop!

56
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,300
Congratulations on becoming LaReine Group's president.

57
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,400
You finally did it.

58
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,600
I sincerely congratulate you.

59
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,960
I waited for this day to come.

60
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,250
You waited a long time.

61
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,040
Thank you.

62
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,150
By the way, what happened with my uncle?

63
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,620
He's not the type to back off willingly.

64
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,640
 Mr. Yoon Hyeong Gook?

65
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,800
 Congratulations, President Shin Myeong Seop.

66
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,140
 What is it that you want?

67
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,610
 Since you must be busy, I'll get to the point.

68
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,750
 Please help get Yeongwon Leather become the subcontractor again.

69
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,650
 If I open my mouth...

70
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,590
 You know. You shouldn't get fired right after becoming president.

71
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,950
 Subcontracting...

72
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,600
 I'll give it to you.

73
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,430
 Pardon?

74
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,620
 Let's renew the contract.

75
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,310
 Do you really mean that?

76
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,130
I told you I'd take care of it. It went well.

77
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,970
He won't bother you anymore.

78
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,050
That's a relief.

79
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,930
You've now achieved everything.

80
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,860
Not yet.

81
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,180
It's still not enough for you?

82
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,600
I have to become the chairman.

83
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,810
The very top.

84
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,680
Being second-in-command isn't my thing.

85
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,220
You know...

86
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,700
I have something to tell you.

87
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,620
Well...

88
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,750
I want to have a baby. No, I will.

89
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,470
I won't make you feel burdened.

90
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,090
I'll raise the baby alone.

91
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,570
I really want a baby.

92
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,980
Our child.

93
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,740
If you act like this,

94
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,630
I can't continue our relationship.

95
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,070
I only need you.

96
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,190
Don't think about anything else.

97
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,940
I know. I know that, butâ€”

98
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,810
Having a child we can't take care of properly

99
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,660
is irresponsible.

100
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,730
Later. After a little time passes.

101
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,410
Once I get everything I want.

102
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,780
Do what you want then.

103
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,830
But until that time, you have to do what I ask.

104
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,030
Okay.

105
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,600
Good. My Mi Ra...

106
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,690
Hold on.

107
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,450

108
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah, Honey.

109
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,130
Where are you?

110
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,210
I'm out with everyone for a second round, but they won't let me leave.

111
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,830
Why don't you go to bed first?

112
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,930
Come home right now.

113
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,790
Honey.

114
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,390
Get in.

115
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,550
Seon Joo, what are you doing?

116
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,330
You'll get into an accident. Slow down.

117
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,910
What's going on? Why are you doing this?

118
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,950
Han Seon Joo!

119
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,040
Yoon Mi Ra...

120
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,970
How could you betray me?

121
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,590
I don't know what you heard,

122
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:50,360
but, Seon Joo, why would I cheat on you?

123
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,720
How long are you going to hide it from me?

124
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,630
Hide what?

125
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,890
I saw you two together at the inauguration with my own eyes!

126
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,370
In the stairway...

127
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,420
She was an employee at the subcontracting company. We met because of work

128
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:30,370
and I made a mistake. It's like a

129
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,820
meaningless accident.

130
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,520
Stop with the predictable excuse.

131
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:40,610
You know how many women have tried to seduce me.

132
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,120
Among all those women, just once...

133
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,180
It was just one mistake.

134
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,250
Just one mistake?

135
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,230
Do you want a compliment?

136
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,090
Of course, I shouldn't have met with her. I shouldn't have done it.

137
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,200
But that woman really doesn't mean anything to me.

138
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,390
We have no special relationship.

139
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,350
You want me to believe you right now?

140
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm sorry.

141
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,870
I acknowledge my mistake and judgment.

142
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,270
I'll end it with her. Ending it will take care of it.

143
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,090
So, Seon Joo, please trust me.

144
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,560
No. I can never trust you again.

145
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,660
No! I will not trust you.

146
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,430
Seon Joo.

147
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,770
You know that I love you.

148
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,980
Love?

149
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Cheating is only a momentary thing. It passes by and means nothing.

150
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,240
This is just... something that will merely pass us by.

151
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,860
Are you trying to justify your actions right now?!

152
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,340
You're really...

153
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,190
disgusting.

154
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,140
Seon Joo.

155
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,980
I must have been crazy. I'm sorry.

156
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,990
Honey, please calm down and listen to me.

157
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,740
Honey.

158
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,540
Seon Joo.

159
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,160
Your man, Mi Ra...

160
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,000
I think you told me you were on your last breakup trip.

161
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Traveling to Yeoju.

162
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,580
Why weren't you able to break up?

163
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,040
Because...

164
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,100
I took some pills.

165
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,660
 Hello?

166
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,720
 Yes, I'll be right there.

167
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
 Honey, you'll have to return alone.

168
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,730
 I need to go somewhere quickly.

169
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,160
 I'll see you at home.

170
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,890
 Wait...

171
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,050
How did you two meet?

172
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,070
 Say that again. Say it!

173
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,200

174
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,920
 Aren't you brave. Say that again.

175
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,900
 My parents built this factory with their blood and sweat.

176
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,610
 It's not yours.

177
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,500
 You're not free to sell it.

178
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,410
 You handed it over to me by signing the paperwork.

179
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,620
 What's it to you what I do with it?

180
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,310
 Forcing me to sign it over isn't valid.

181
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,130
 I'll sue you and get the factory back from you.

182
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,980
 What? Sue?

183
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,160
 You must be desperate to die, huh?

184
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,880
 Fine. If that's what you want so badly, I'll kill you.

185
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,690
 What are you trying to do?

186
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,960
 Executive Director Shin...

187
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,600
I met him when things were tough for me.

188
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,840
When it was tough for the both of us...

189
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,840
When it was tough for the both of you?

190
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,750
We've been seeing each other

191
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,740
for two years.

192
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,960
You've been seeing each other for two years?

193
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,600
Yes.

194
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,260
What did he say...

195
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,000
was so tough for him?

196
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,200
Maybe some kind of pressure to be perfect?

197
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,150
That he can't disappoint his perfect wife no matter what.

198
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,070
The suffocating pressure where he can't dare to let on that things are hard for him.

199
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,760
She acts like she's helping him quietly,

200
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,730
but in the end, she's a conceited queen who makes him into her puppet.

201
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,030
Everything he has right now

202
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,340
is all because of his wife.

203
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,500
He told me once

204
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:43,080
that he can finally breathe comfortably now that he's with me.

205
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,780
He's a very

206
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,270
pitiful person.

207
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,060
I'll get going now.

208
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,740

209
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,470
Did she find out?

210
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,340

211
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,600

212
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,140
Honey.

213
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,820
At the Victoria launching show, there was a woman I met by chance in Yeosu.

214
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,760
But I met her again at Queen's Club.

215
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,570
Yoon Mi Ra.

216
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,580
Not realizing she was your mistress,

217
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,480
do you know what I've been doing?

218
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,650
There's only one decision I can make, no matter how much I think about it.

219
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,450
Let's get a divorce.

220
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,280
I told you.

221
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,780
She's just passing wind, that's all.

222
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,810
You and the kids are all I have.

223
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,640
Our family means everything to me.

224
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,800
How can wind... pass by for two years?

225
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,620
I tried to break away from her many times.

226
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,340
But her obsession made it last this long.

227
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,160
More excuses...

228
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,820
I'm sorry.

229
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,210
I should have ended it long ago.

230
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,720
I will make sure to end it this time.

231
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,800
No matter what she says or acts.

232
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,060
So, Seon Joo...

233
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,360
I'll send over the divorce papers.

234
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,880
Aren't you worried about the kids?

235
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,720
What did you say?

236
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,950
Aren't you worried about the pain the children will feel because of the divorce?

237
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,300
Shut that dirty mouth of yours.

238
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Must you make our kids end up like you and your sister?

239
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,860
You told me yourself.

240
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,600
That what happened to her was because of your father's absence.

241
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,360
If Tae Hee ends up like your sister, what are you going to do?

242
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,900
What if Tae Yong ends up going down the wrong path, too?!

243
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,570
Hey, Shin Myeong Seop...

244
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,010
you crazy bastard!

245
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,440
 I'll die if you and dad get divorced.

246
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:14,700
You broke my unbreakable trust into pieces.

247
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,280
I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive you.

248
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,830
Shin Myeong Seop as my husband...

249
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,880
doesn't exist anymore.

250
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,270
But... the marriage...

251
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,910
and family, since they're not just about the two of us,

252
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,950
for the sake of the family, more than anything,

253
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,800
for my children's sake...

254
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,950
I will let it go this one time.

255
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,190
But if you disappoint me again,

256
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,690
I will divorce you without any hesitation.

257
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,720
Okay.

258
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,830
That will never happen.

259
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,440
You can trust me.

260
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,770
It's been so long since the whole family's been together like this.

261
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,730
It's been five years since he went overseas when I was in grade school.

262
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,170
It's been that long?

263
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,240
I saw you occasionally when I went overseas for work,

264
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,560
but it's really been a long time since the whole family's had dinner together.

265
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,340
Don't you think so, Honey?

266
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,580
Uncle, do you have a girlfriend?

267
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,080
Girlfriend? I have many.

268
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,950
Veronica, Sophia,

269
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,640
- Elsa. 
 - Not a female friend but a girlfriend.

270
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,690
He doesn't have one. He's been single forever.

271
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,140
What? Single forever?

272
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,950
Wow, Shin Tae Hee, are you dissing me?

273
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,060
Why is everyone talking so much at dinner?

274
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,820
Tae Hee and Tae Yong, don't do that elsewhere.

275
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,970
People will criticize you for your lack of manners at the table.

276
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,610
Okay.

277
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,460
Jeong Won finally came back after five years.

278
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,850
It was our chance to eat together as a family for once.

279
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,670
Did it make you that unhappy?

280
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,850
I already saw him at your husband's inauguration. Why did you get us together for dinner?

281
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,290
How did you... bear with it?

282
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,530
- What do you mean? 
 - Father...

283
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,620
when you first found out he was cheating on you,

284
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,970
how did you hang on?

285
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,660
Why are you asking that?

286
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,010
I was just curious.

287
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,820
Did your... husband cheat on you?

288
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,970
No.

289
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,160
So why are you asking that out of the blue?

290
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,980
You still don't acknowledge Jeong Won as your son.

291
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,120
I was curious why you chose to accept Jeong Won

292
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,720
when you were going to act this way.

293
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,470
I just couldn't forgive him no matter what.

294
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,240
So I thought about leaving him,

295
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,020
but I was worried about you and Yeon Joo.

296
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,500
When things would be fine if I alone suppressed my feelings.

297
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,040
I couldn't let you kids grow up without a father.

298
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,140
So I did everything I could to bear with it

299
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,710
and accepted him, too.

300
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,110
I told myself he must have just made a mistake.

301
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,300
That if I forgave him, he would never do it again.

302
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,910
But I was wrong.

303
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,460
He was born as a womanizer.

304
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,710
It can never be fixed even after death.

305
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,070
Myeong Seop, what brings you by?

306
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,480
Why did you do it?

307
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,910
You approached my wife on purpose.

308
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:18,670
Why? Can I not?

309
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,100
You're right. I approached her on purpose.

310
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,570
Why did you do it?

311
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,820
I was sincerely curious.

312
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,120
I was jealous and wanted to see what kind of person she was.

313
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,140
Your curiosity

314
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,960
messed up our relationship.

315
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,060
You shouldn't have done that if you wanted to continue with our relationship.

316
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,590
You should have stayed quiet.

317
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,700
I can't come over anymore.

318
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,610
Don't leave!

319
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,750
You created this whole situation.

320
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,590
Blame yourself.

321
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,490
- Dad! 
 - Did you sleep well?

322
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,930
Where's Ms. Kim? Why are you making breakfast?

323
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,520
I told her to take a break.

324
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,810
I wanted to make breakfast today.

325
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,810
Everyone, sit down.

326
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,760
Breakfast is ready.

327
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,730
What's the occasion?

328
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,200
What do you mean? I couldn't do it because I've been busy.

329
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,580
You sit down, too, Honey.

330
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,220
What is it? It smells good.

331
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,060
Abalone porridge. It's good to have something that's gentle on the stomach for breakfast.

332
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,380
I didn't know you could make this.

333
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,440
Actually, I learned it all here.

334
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,550
I followed the recipe, but I can't guarantee the taste.

335
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:10,010

336
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,930
Mi Ra didn't come to Queen's Club today. I wonder if something's wrong.

337
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,560
Why didn't Mi Ra show up today?

338
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,900
How would I know that?

339
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,730
Han Seon Joo.

340
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,760
- What are you doing here? 
 - I came to see you.

341
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,450
Here.

342
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,710
I prepared it for you.

343
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,670
You're still the same.

344
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,630
Do you two know each other?

345
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,950
Classmate from college.

346
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,390
We belonged to the same club.

347
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,880
- I see. 
 - Hello.

348
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,180
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

349
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,080
Really, what brings you here?

350
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,750
Get in.

351
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,630
- What? 
 - Hurry up and come!

352
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,070
Get in!

353
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,710
See you.

354
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,640
You're still unpredictable.

355
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,430
Let's go in.

356
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,780
Have some tea.

357
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,440
What's gotten into you?

358
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
Why are we here all of a sudden?

359
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,030
Seon Joo, are you sure you're okay these days?

360
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,120
What?

361
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:36,250
Of course. I'm fine.

362
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,760
Yeah? Okay then.

363
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,430
But...

364
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,810
By chance, if there's anything you want to talk about,

365
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,110
come over at any time. Just like before.

366
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,040
You'll do that, right?

367
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,600
Okay.

368
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,090
You like wine, don't you?

369
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,300
Come see me whenever you need a drinking buddy.

370
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,930
I will.

371
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,180
Thank you.

372
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,120
If everyone's glass is filled, let's toast.

373
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,730
Por el amor de todos. (Spanish)

374
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,900
To everyone's love.

375
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,670
- Salut! 
 - Salut!

376
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,260
Salut!

377
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,970
Cheers.

378
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,310
When my wife first asked me to do it with her,

379
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,840
I thought learning to tango was embarrassing.

380
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,150
But now I can't wait to come to the tango club.

381
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,860
 That's how it is.

382
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,640
I think you two have become so great at tango.

383
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,030
Especially the way you strongly lead her along

384
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,200
is so full of charisma.

385
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,250
 Hah! All he does is beat his wife up. Devoted, my butt.

386
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,250
 Does he still beat her up?

387
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,350
 Didn't you see how much makeup she laid on today?

388
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,240
 It means she got hit.

389
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,610
 He keeps beating her up and then buys her a luxury brand bag.

390
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:54,330
 Keeps beating her up and then buys her jewelry, beats her up and then buys her shoes.

391
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,100
 But she's shamelessly brags about the gifts

392
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,420
 on her social media.

393
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,910
 I don't understand why she lives like that when she comes from a wealthy family.

394
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:05,420
 Is being a wife of the chief prosecutor that important?

395
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,090
 He's a thug, not a chief prosecutor! That thug bastard!

396
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,600
Not at all. I thought you two looked amazing.

397
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,330
Especially your consideration for each other which shows through the tango.

398
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,020
 You must have really gone crazy.

399
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,900
 Why do you keep laughing for no reason?

400
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,360
 Actually, there was a huge commotion at Queen's Club.

401
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,870
 You know how Jeong Gook's dad is delusionally jealous.

402
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,470
 He was fine for a while, but it must have come back.

403
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,290
 He accused his wife of having an affair with the club manager

404
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,360
 and screamed at the top of his lungs.

405
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,280
 I suddenly thought of it, that's why.

406
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,810
 Hey.

407
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,020
 Are they having an affair?

408
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,720
 Not at all. She's not crazy.

409
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,810
 That CEO Lee bastard...

410
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,000
 he needs a good beating.

411
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,840
Oh, we shouldn't be so freely complimenting each other in front of our teacher.

412
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,710
- That's true. 
 - Oh no, not at all.

413
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,540
Well, not because I taught you,

414
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,420
but all of you have improved so much.

415
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,640
Acknowledged!

416
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,070
Especially the President Shin couple,

417
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:29,030
people would believe it if you said you were pros.

418
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,770
 - That's true.  
 - True.

419
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,340
You two look really great together.

420
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,540
I was so envious that I almost got jealous!

421
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,120

422
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,090
Why aren't you answering?

423
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:10,390
Oh... it's not important.

424
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,920
Why is he bothering me?

425
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,440
He's a subcontractor from before,

426
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,950
and he keeps asking me for a favor after finding out that I became president.

427
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,940
Call him back.

428
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,360
What?

429
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,710
I'll do it later.

430
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,010
It's Yoon Mi Ra, isn't it?

431
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,760
I know it's her calling.

432
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,690
You still haven't ended things with her?

433
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,390
Until exactly when will you...

434
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,480
If you can't do end it, I will.

435
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,290
I'll get rid of Yoon Mi Ra for you.

436
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:02,120
No. I'll do it.

437
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,690
I have to do it.

438
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:09,340
I can't make you do this kind of thing, either.

439
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,980

440
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,910
I was waiting for you.

441
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,650
Why didn't you answer earlier?

442
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,560
I'm sorry.

443
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,680
I'll listen to you from now on.

444
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,310
I won't do anything you don't want me to. I promise.

445
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,540
I have something I want to say.

446
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,480
You know, I have something to show you.

447
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,070
Ta-da!

448
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,940
Stop.

449
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,920
Stop what?

450
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,750
You already know the man you're seeing is my husband.

451
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,210
How dare you laugh?

452
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,660
But it's funny.

453
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,340
You're the one who told me to become his wife.

454
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,140
Even if I have to take or steal.

455
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,610
You told me to have Shin Myeong Seop for myself.

456
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,690
I'm sorry, but I can't break up with him.

457
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,230
Like you said, I can't live without him,

458
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:54,420
so I'm planning on having him.

459
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,800
Hey!

460
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,470
How can you be so confident?

461
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,630
How can you be so shameless going after someone else's husband?

462
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,150
Fine. I'm the one who's crazy.

463
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,330
Since I treated you like my own sister without realizing you were my husband's mistress.

464
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:16,790
I even told you to take my husband, so I'm the crazy one.

465
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,770
Die.

466
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,810
Die! Die!

467
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,580
Die!

468
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,170
Yeon Joo...

469
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,530
Sis!

470
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:38,750
Yeon Joo!

471
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,900
Yes, Seon Joo.

472
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,170
I never thought

473
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,630
I would be here with you again.

474
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,570

475
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,810
I told you before...

476
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:39,110
to take that man.

477
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,570
Yes.

478
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:45,790
If I can't break up with him, if I feel like I'd die without him,

479
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:49,160
you told me to become his wife.

480
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,980
You did.

481
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,320
I was too rash.

482
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,380
No matter what, there are things in this world you should never do.

483
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,210
Destroying someone else's family.

484
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,780
You must never do that.

485
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:25,240
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

486
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,000
I believe you understand.

487
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,920
The air freshener is a bit too strong.

488
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,810
I thought about it...

489
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,300
but I don't think I can break up with him.

490
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,160
Stop putting on an act already.

491
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,610
You know Shin Myeong Seop is my husband!

492
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,240
Yes.

493
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,140
But...

494
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,900
But I can't.

495
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,360
What?

496
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,300
Because...

497
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,070
I'm pregnant.

498
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,350
No!

499
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:02,330

500
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:07,520
â™«  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  â™«

501
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,990
â™«  If there is, knock. Hello  â™«

502
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:16,930
â™«  If you are still there  â™«

503
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:21,550
You look really happy together in that photo.

504
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:30,250
What will people say once they find out that smile is just for show?

505
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,400
I'm curious.

506
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,920
â™«  The bright lights of this city  â™«

507
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:41,350
â™«  My footsteps have been erased  â™«

508
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,900
â™«  Hearing your presence  â™«

509
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,350
â™«  The unspoken screams get louder  â™«

510
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,270
â™«  On the streets where even the gods left  â™«

511
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,810
â™«  What kind of justice? What is the standard?  â™«

512
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,120
â™«  Shall I hold your hand? No one knows  â™«

513
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,050
â™«  No one knows  â™«

514
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,110

515
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:14,600
 Can you move them into separate rooms?

516
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,580
 Where's Yoon Mi Ra?

517
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,490
 Where's Han Seon Joo?

518
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:20,010
 Her husband took her.

519
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,200
 Weren't you worried if our baby was okay?

520
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,580
 How can you just take her when I was still laying there?!

521
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,300
 That's how cheating men usually are.

522
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,040
 No. He's different.

523
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,850
 Mr. Shin Myeong Seop put the apartment up for sale.

524
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,290
 Are you trying to kick me out?

525
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,030
 Let's end it between us.

526
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,270
 I will never end it! Never!

527
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:46,180
 I'll never forgive you or Han Seon Joo.

528
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,580
 Seon Joo...

529
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,090
â™«  Ignored in the city's splendid lights and natural ignorance  â™«

530
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,940
â™«  Tell me you exist  â™«
