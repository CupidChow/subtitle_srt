1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,030
Yoon Mi Ra is in a coma.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,350
If she's in a coma then is she unconscious?

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,950
Yes, for now, you've avoided being a murderer.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,800
Be careful with what you say.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,940
According to Shin Myeong Seop's statement,

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,970
you knew that Yoon Mi Ra was his mistress.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,580
Is that true?

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,670
Yes.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,270
You must have felt uncomfortable with her then.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,190
So why was she there?

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,440

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,670
  It looks like a happy family photo.

13
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,730
 I wonder what people will say once they find out that smile was...

14
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,350
 just for show?

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,980
Show window lives are all bound to shatter.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,700
Whether it happens sooner or later is the only difference.

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,200
Marriage is like war.

18
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,560
Today you could be best friends

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,170
then tomorrow you could become mortal enemies and stab each other...

20
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,440
That's what marriage is.

21
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,120
It's starting.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,320
Excuse me. I need to be at the party.

23
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,100
Han Seon Joo!

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,700

25
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,690
- Yes? 
  - By chance, are you Han Seon Joo's husband?

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200

27
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,170
- Yes? 
   - That's strange. It's the same number.

28
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,420
 Do you know someone named Yoon Mi Ra?

29
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,540

30
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,500
Fortunately, they both don't seem to have any serious injuries except for some minor ones.

31
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,840
Wait, Doctor.

32
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,320
I have a favor to ask.

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,120
Could you move them into separate rooms?

34
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,580
Oh, sure. We will do that.

35
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,190
You're awake?

36
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,800
Where am I?

37
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,670
The hospital.

38
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,330
You were in a car accident.

39
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,370
Car accident?

40
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,870
You are unscathed

41
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,110
compared to how badly the car is damaged.

42
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,520
What about Mi Ra?

43
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,080
Yoon Mi Ra... What happened to her?

44
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,060
She didn't get badly hurt either.

45
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,860
She's being treated now.

46
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,380
What is it? Does it hurt a lot?

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Should I call for the doctor?

48
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,440
Wait... Do you need anything?

49
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,860
Did you know?

50
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,950
That Mi Ra was pregnant?

51
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,310
You knew...

52
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,970
Crazy son of a bitch...

53
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,520

54
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,400

55
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,720
Are you awake?

56
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,890
What is this place?

57
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,590
The hospital.

58
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,520
You were in a car accident. Do you not remember?

59
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,640
Han Seon Joo...

60
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,470
What happened to her? We were in the same car.

61
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,360
- Oh, she was discharged. 
 - Discharged?

62
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,970
Yes. Fortunately, she wasn't hurt too badly either, so she was discharged quickly.

63
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,470
Her husband came and took her home.

64
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,440
Husband...

65
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,550
Her husband came?

66
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,510
Yes. He took such good care of her.

67
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,200
You don't need to worry.

68
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,220
What's the matter?

69
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,310
Are you hurting somewhere?

70
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,640
Oh no!

71
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,630
The baby...

72
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,900
My baby!

73
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,760
My baby...

74
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,850
 The number you have dialed is not—

75
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,560

76
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,620
 Ta-da!

77
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,550
 What is all this?

78
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,780
 Isn't it pretty?

79
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,270
 It's our baby. Yours and mine.

80
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,760
Where are you going?

81
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,100
- You're up? 
 - I asked where you're going.

82
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,240
Oh, I was going to go get some air.

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,110
Don't go.

84
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,910
Okay. I won't.

85
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,060
 I'm pregnant.

86
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,180
The baby...

87
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,640
The baby is safe, right?

88
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,490
You miscarried.

89
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,970
No...

90
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,170
No, no...

91
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,040
It's not true.

92
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,010
No, no...

93
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,660
No, bring my baby back.

94
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,240
Bring my baby back!

95
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,250
Bring my baby back!

96
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,770
Please calm down.

97
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,700
Bring my baby back...

98
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,470
My poor baby...

99
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,200
My poor baby...

100
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,580

101
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,780

102
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,860

103
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,010

104
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,970
 You will be connected to voicemail and be charged for the call.

105
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,890
I'll change your bandages.

106
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,560
I want to be discharged.

107
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,930

108
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,470
Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

109
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,180
After effects from a car accident can be bad.

110
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,510
Mom, you had a thorough exam. Right?

111
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,380
Don't worry, I did.

112
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,780
What were the test results? There were no problems, right?

113
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,090
I'm fine, and I'm not hurting. You'll be late. Hurry up and go.

114
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,870
Goodbye.

115
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,460
Goodbye.

116
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,040
Let's go.

117
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,390
Where did the patient Yoon Mi Ra go?

118
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,300
She was discharged.

119
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,820
Pardon?

120
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,030
What do you mean you want to switch to Yeongwon Leather as the subcontractor?

121
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,480
Isn't Yeongwon Leather the company that we fired because of a problem two years ago?

122
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,460
Yes. That's true, but the recent Victoria brand design was

123
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,930
done by one of the female staff there, so I think the contract was renewed.

124
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,290
Victoria's designer is a female staff from Yeongwon Leather?

125
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,750
Yes.

126
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,290
Did CEO Shin make the decision?

127
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,460
Yes, he did.

128
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,470
Call in President Shin.

129
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,500
Yes, Ma'am.

130
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,530
What's the name of that designer?

131
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,350
Pardon?

132
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,510
Victoria's designer.

133
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,940
The female staff at Yeongwon. What's her name?

134
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Why do you ask?

135
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,700
Did you promise them the subcontractor deal in return for the Victoria design?

136
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,580
Oh, no.

137
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,500
The reason for renewing the contract with them was, even though they made a mistake in the past,

138
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,960
it's a solid company, and they've been with us a long time–

139
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,910
That woman...

140
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,980
I'm going to meet with her, so bring her.

141
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,780
Is there an issue?

142
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,560
Why?

143
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,800
Is there a reason you can't bring her?

144
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,640
Oh, no. I'll contact her.

145
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,880
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

146
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,390
♫  If there is, knock.  Hello.  ♫

147
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,750
♫  If you are still there  ♫

148
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,870
♫  On the streets where even the gods left  ♫

149
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,400
♫  What kind of justice? What is the standard?  ♫

150
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,630
♫  Shall I hold your hand?  ♫

151
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,860
♫  No one knows  ♫

152
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,470
♫  Hello... Hello...  ♫

153
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,220
Unni.

154
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,320
I came because I was worried.

155
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,470
I heard that you were discharged from the hospital, but I wasn't going to feel relieved until I saw you myself.

156
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,490
Are you okay?

157
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,390
You look well. That's a relief.

158
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm okay. You must have been really worried.

159
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,400
Of course... the baby is fine, too.

160
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,450
Are you going to keep me standing out here?

161
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,350
Then should I be inviting you in?

162
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,480
I came over because I was very concerned about you.

163
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,710
You could at least offer me some tea.

164
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,370
You and I have become close.

165
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,560
Close?

166
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,020
Leave.

167
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,860
Oh! Mom!

168
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,740
Hi.

169
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,070
We met last time, right?

170
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,170
Oh, hello!

171
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,900
Are you coming home from school right now?

172
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,050
From the academy after school.

173
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,420
You must be tired.

174
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,110
Let's go in.

175
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,020
I ran over after hearing your mom got into an accident.

176
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,910
I was so worried that I couldn't sit still.

177
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,080
It's a relief she didn't get badly hurt,

178
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,110
but we were so shocked.

179
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,890
I'm sure.

180
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,070
But... you look a little different...

181
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,990
than the last time we saw you.

182
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,470
Yeah, I changed my makeup.

183
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,490
What do you think? Does it suit me?

184
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,820
You looked more innocent last time,

185
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,920
but now you look more urbanized and modern?

186
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,290
Personally, I like this style much better.

187
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,080
Really? I was worried it might not suit me,

188
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,940
but I'm relieved that you like it.

189
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,040
It's late. Could you leave now?

190
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,430
Unni.

191
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,650
I'd like some dinner. I'm hungry.

192
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,020
Dad!

193
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,380
It's nice to meet you.

194
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm Yoon Mi Ra.

195
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,390
She's friends with Mom.

196
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,430
I thought Tae Yong looked like his mom,

197
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,810
but he looks more like his dad.

198
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,420
Mi Ra, please leave now.

199
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,660
I heard about you a lot from Seon Joo.

200
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,270
Are you okay?

201
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,820
Is it because of the accident?

202
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,590
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

203
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,210
No, I don't need to.

204
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,590
You're not a doctor.

205
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,070
Let's go to the hospital right now.

206
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,240
I'll go tomorrow.

207
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,690
I like playing chess, too.

208
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,090
It's Promotion.

209
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,370
You know about it?

210
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,940
It's a special rule that allows the pawn to be promoted to the Queen

211
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,950
if it reaches the opponent's side.

212
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,600
You know it well.

213
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,430
- Then you've become the Black Queen now? 
 - Yes.

214
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,960
I've become the Black Queen.

215
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,550
Excuse me.

216
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,700
Could you... leave now?

217
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,700
My wife doesn't seem to be feeling well.

218
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,390
Mom!

219
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,130
I need to get some rest.

220
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm worried. I hope it's not an aftereffect of the accident.

221
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,130
Then I'll leave for today.

222
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,320
Brother-in-Law.

223
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,660
Could you drive me home?

224
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,270
I feel bad about calling for a cab since it's too close for the driver,

225
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,320
but I can't walk home since I happened to be wearing high heels.

226
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,700
Oh, it's so funny.

227
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,720
My stomach hurts from laughing so much.

228
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,400
The look of shock on your face earlier was so funny.

229
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,380
I nearly took a photo of it.

230
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,020
What the hell is wrong with you?

231
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,110
Did you even care whether I died or not?

232
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,170
You weren't even worried if our baby was okay?

233
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,340
How could you just leave with Han Seon Joo when I was still laying there?!

234
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,800
Then what could I have done...

235
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,300
in that situation?

236
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,000
Go study abroad.

237
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,740
What?

238
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,260
I told you. You're talented.

239
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,130
I'll support you,

240
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,790
so go study design abroad.

241
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,720
And...

242
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,630
have the baby there, too.

243
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,090
Are you trying to...

244
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,410
send me and the baby far away right now?

245
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,220
Let's...

246
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,710
think and act more maturely

247
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,110
about what's best for us.

248
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,090
I will never...

249
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,700
ignore you and the baby. I'll take full responsibility.

250
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,850
But right now, we need to be careful.

251
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,840
For us

252
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,950
and our baby's sake.

253
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,700
For us...

254
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,550
and our baby's sake?

255
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,450
That's right. Us.

256
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,530
And for our baby's sake.

257
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,610
Everything will be ruined if you blow up like this.

258
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,330
So, Mi Ra,

259
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,770
let's hang on a little longer, huh?

260
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,100
Until when?!

261
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,220
How long do I have to wait?!

262
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,090
Until I have...

263
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,260
all of LaReine.

264
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,510
Until I make you...

265
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,460
LaReine's owner's wife.

266
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,360
I came to warn you.

267
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,540
Warn me?

268
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,710
Leave this neighborhood right now.

269
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,200
Stay away from me and my family!

270
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,480
I don't think I can do that.

271
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,490
What?

272
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
I told you.

273
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,680
I tried to leave but couldn't.

274
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,450
Besides...

275
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,620
now I have a reason to stay.

276
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,310
So...

277
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,860
So what are you going to do?

278
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,500
I still don't know yet what I should do.

279
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,550
For now,

280
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,470
isn't it better to give birth to the baby first?

281
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,620
Oh, right! I decorated the baby's room. Do you want to see it?

282
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,500
I heard there are a lot of things to prepare before giving birth.

283
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,720
My mom isn't alive

284
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,780
and I don't have an older sister.

285
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,920
Can't you help me, Unni?

286
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,460
You...

287
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,870
Seon Joo.

288
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,040
You bastard.

289
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,210
Wait.

290
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Don't you dare touch me.

291
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,700
The person I wanted to see was the designer of Victoria.

292
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,820
Oh, I thought it'd be better to ask President Yoon Hyeong Gook here

293
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,610
about whatever you want to know directly.

294
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,060
Fine. You may leave.

295
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,560
Yes, Ma'am.

296
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,180
What is Victoria's designer doing these days?

297
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,170
Pardon? Oh, my niece?

298
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,970
She's married and living well.

299
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,480
She's married?

300
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,280
Yes. She even has a kid.

301
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,120
But why are you asking about my niece all of a sudden?

302
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,060
I liked the Victoria design, so I was going to

303
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,820
ask her to work on the next project.

304
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,440
Oh, she doesn't work anymore.

305
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,490
She's having fun raising her child.

306
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,580
Then, where does she live now?

307
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,760
Somewhere near Changwon. I mean to visit her,

308
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,690
but I haven't been able to since I'm so busy. I'm a terrible uncle.

309
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,490
Since we're on the subject, I should go see her.

310
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,230
Honey.

311
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,610
Are you close to Han Seon Joo?

312
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
Well, we do see each other a lot.

313
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,610
Are we close? I'm not sure.

314
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,920
She's not someone who gets too close with people.

315
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,000
I wonder...

316
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,260
if I can ask her for a loan...

317
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,560
W-What? A loan?

318
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,460
You want to...

319
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,060
Honey! Is the company in trouble?!

320
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,480

321
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,910
Daeha Law Firm?

322
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,540
What's this?

323
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,420
Can't you tell?

324
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,450
It's a business card.

325
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,810
So why are you the attorney for Daeha Law Firm?

326
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,600
You're the Chief Prosecutor at Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office.

327
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,050
What nonsense. I quit.

328
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,230
What do you mean you quit? Quit what?

329
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,370
I quit being a prosecutor!

330
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,780
- Why?! 
 - Because I got paid pennies

331
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,920
and all I got was criticism!

332
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,570
But still, how can you quit?

333
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,070
Are you crazy?!

334
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,170
What did you say? How dare you call me crazy?!

335
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,630

336
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,600
Yeah?

337
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,470
I want to have the vongole pasta that you make.

338
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,200
I haven't been able to eat anything these days because of morning sickness.

339
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,260
You'll come, right?

340
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,010
Aren't you eating?

341
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,010
I ate already. Go ahead and eat.

342
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,180
It's delicious.

343
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,180
Your pasta is the best.

344
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,050
By the way...

345
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,860
have you thought about it?

346
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,240
What we talked about last time, about studying abroad?

347
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,130
These are the forms.

348
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,740
Are you trying to...

349
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,620
get rid of me?

350
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,350
Mi Ra, do you really not know how I feel?

351
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,060
No, I don't.

352
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:01,250
It only feels like you're trying to get rid of me.

353
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,430
Do you want our baby...

354
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,260
to be born as an illegitimate child?

355
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,880
We can't do that to the child.

356
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,530
This is the best plan

357
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,600
for you and the baby's sake.

358
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,280
I'll think about it.

359
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,550
Oh right. I heard about your accident. Are you all better?

360
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,090
I guess you are since you came out to the tango club. Thank goodness.

361
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,620
Thank you for your concern.

362
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,770
I was so shocked. It's a relief she didn't get more hurt.

363
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,600
Oh, by the way, I think Mi Ra is pregnant.

364
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,670
She filled her social media with baby items.

365
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,080
A bed, swaddle, shoes, mobile...

366
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,950
And the sure giveaway is the number of days she's counting down. 200, 199, 198.

367
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,900
Who's she?

368
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,460
She's a member of Queen's Club.

369
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,860
A mistress.

370
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,190
Oh, why is the neighborhood becoming so cheap?

371
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,110
Seon Joo, do you know anything?

372
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,900
I don't.

373
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,800
That can't be. Maybe you're wrong.

374
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,420
She's not pregnant.

375
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,520
How do you know that?

376
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,150
I saw her, that's why.

377
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,120
 Excuse me. Do you have any sanitary napkins?

378
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,090
 Yes, we do.

379
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,520
 Thank you.

380
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,830
That just happened yesterday.

381
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,800
How can a pregnant woman have her period? That doesn't make sense.

382
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,010
That's odd. Then what do all her baby posts mean?

383
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,840
Let's talk.

384
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,950
Yoon Mi Ra had a miscarriage.

385
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,630
Is that true?

386
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,500
I checked with the doctor.

387
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,300
He said she had the surgery on the day of the accident.

388
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,130
There is no baby now.

389
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,110
It may sound cold, but there's no reason for you to hesitate anymore.

390
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,030
I know... what you're saying.

391
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,130
It'll be over soon. Don't worry.

392
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,370
Team Leader, the special order shoes arrived.

393
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,340
Thank you.

394
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,630
Not bad.

395
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,860
It's sophisticated yet comfortable.

396
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,380
Who brought in the shoes that are in my room?

397
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,190
 Design Team Leader, Han Jeong Won.

398
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,720
Team Leader Han Jeong Won did?

399
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,370
Okay.

400
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,100
Who is it?

401
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,080
 Hello, we're from the real estate company.

402
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,910
Pardon? The real estate company?

403
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,550
You put your home on the market, right?

404
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,890
 Can we take a quick look inside?

405
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,540
I never did that.

406
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,780
That's strange.

407
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,060
 Mr. Shin Myeong Seop put it up for sale.

408
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,140
What?

409
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,710
It was you, wasn't it?

410
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:44,430
I know you're trying to kick me out of my place to get rid of me. You're manipulating him.

411
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,430
Get in.

412
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,310
Because of you,

413
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,930
a life that never got to bloom has disappeared.

414
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,070
My precious baby died.

415
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,660
I'm sorry about what happened to the baby.

416
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:54,000
Han Seon Joo, you took everything away from me!

417
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,050
Took everything away?

418
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,850
You're the one who took what's mine.

419
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,970
Was it fun?

420
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:11,020
Bracelet, meat, his family runs an orchard, and leaf mustard kimchi!

421
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,920
You were having fun while throwing me clues.

422
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:22,090
Was it fun watching me cheer you on like a clueless fool?!

423
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:29,200
I thought we were destined for a precious relationship...

424
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:37,570
I sincerely cared for you and thought of you as my sister,

425
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,550
but you're the worst.

426
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,140
Let's never see each other again.

427
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,570
The one who Shin Myeong Seop truly loves is me, not you!

428
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,360
He can only end up happy while being with me.

429
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,810
Do you want to know the real reason

430
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,980
why Yeon Joo committed suicide?

431
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:36,120
The married man she loved, the bastard whom she loved to death,

432
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:42,450
went back to his family after getting caught by his wife and threw her away like a worn out shoe.

433
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,750
That's why my sister died.

434
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,550
Men who cheat are like that.

435
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,500
They never break up their families.

436
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,510
No. He's different.

437
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,210
That's what you want to believe.

438
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,950
That he's different.

439
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,600
But the fact that Shin Myeong Seop is no different,

440
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,370
you'll soon realize that too.

441
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:47,350
I thought about it. I don't want to go study abroad.

442
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,110
I want to have the baby here.

443
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:58,220
I can't let the baby grow up in a foreign country without a dad when it'll have a great dad here.

444
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:03,380
I want the baby to grow up near his dad even if people criticize me.

445
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,850
But you... lost the baby.

446
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,540
There's no baby now.

447
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,350
So stop fighting me.

448
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,280
I see you already knew.

449
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,730
Mi Ra.

450
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,900
Han Seon Joo killed our baby.

451
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,010
- It was an accident. 
 - No!

452
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,460
She crashed the car on purpose.

453
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:45,000
I'll never forgive her. Never.

454
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,690
I can't. Han Seon Joo...

455
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,740
nor you.

456
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,740
That's why you shouldn't have tested me.

457
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,460
What?

458
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,020
You shouldn't have tested me.

459
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,310
You should have had absolute faith in me.

460
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:10,170
If you wanted to keep our relationship going, if you wanted to protect the baby,

461
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,400
you shouldn't have acted that way.

462
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,840
Are you saying everything's my fault?

463
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,430
That's right. It is.

464
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,940
So let's end it.

465
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,230
You and I... won't work anymore.

466
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,730
No.

467
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,140
No... No.

468
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,010
No. No, no.

469
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,610
No! No!

470
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,650
It's not over.

471
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,180
I will never end it!

472
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,290
Never!

473
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,370
Sit down.

474
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,690
What?

475
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,610
Go ahead. You came because you wanted to talk.

476
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,280
You didn't come to your friend Cha Yeong Hoon

477
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,270
but to Dr. Cha Yeong Hoon, a competent psychiatrist, for treatment.

478
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,370
Just be comfortable and tell me whatever you want.

479
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,540
Even if all the men in the world cheat,

480
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:25,830
even if the sky falls, I thought my husband would never.

481
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:30,650
To be honest, the reason I told that woman to become his wife...

482
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,100
came from a foolish confidence

483
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,280
that my husband would never...

484
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,650
that my family would never break or shatter.

485
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,450
What do you intend to do?

486
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,410
How I feel right now...

487
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,030
I want to get a divorce right away.

488
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,590
Then do it. You can do that.

489
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,230
I don't have the confidence.

490
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,740
Don't have the confidence for what?

491
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,230
Our kids...

492
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:13,450
I don't have the confidence to see our kids get hurt and have a hard time.

493
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:19,430
I'm scared... that our kids might end up like Yeon Joo.

494
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:23,800
Even if I stopped existing,

495
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:32,140
I don't ever want to hurt my kids.

496
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,850
So I'm going to hang on with all my might.

497
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,100
I'm going to endure it.

498
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,210
But Yeong Hoon...

499
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,340
it's too hard...

500
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,900
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

501

507
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,400

 The number you have dialed is not in service.

519
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,050
 Please check your number and try again.

520
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:25,330
 The number you have dialed is not in service.

522
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,180
I guess Mi Ra isn't coming anymore.

523
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,110
I know. It's been a while since she's been here.

524
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,700
Maybe something's going on.

525
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,460
What do you mean?

526
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,540
She must have moved away after finding herself another man.

527
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,880
I was annoyed every time I saw her. I feel so relieved!

528
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,170
But... why isn't Han Seon Joo coming by either?

529
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:20,130
No way. Has she decided to stop coming to the club?

530
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,430
No way. She'll come back soon.

531
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,890
It doesn't make sense for Queen's Club not to have its queen.

532
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,830
That's true.

533
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,030
Which one is good?

534
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:40,490
This is popular with families.

535
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,580
We'll have this then.

536
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,390
It's a generous portion.

537
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,190
Thank you.

538
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,110
Miss Kim makes good chicken, too.

539
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:58,630
But the taste of her chicken and of this place is different.

540
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:02,110
It's not the taste that's different but the atmosphere.

541
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,200
Or is it the mood?

542
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,930
Anyway, it's good. Mom, try some.

543
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,610
Should I try, too?

544
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,410
- It's really good. 
 - Right?

545
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,170
Go.

546
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,000
Nice.

547
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,030
Go.

548
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,480
Nice.

549
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,230
How do you feel these days?

550
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,910
I'm a lot better now.

551
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,170
I'm glad.

552
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:49,510
But Seon Joo... if it's for yourself that's one thing,

553
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:53,410
but if it's for someone else's sake, don't hold it all in.

554
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:59,530
Even if it's for your daughter and son you love the most.

555
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:02,180
I understand what you're trying to say.

556
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,090
But... whether I'm holding it in for the kids' sake

557
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:13,350
or for my sake, it's the same thing in the end.

558
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,850
Go.

559
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,550
Hi, Jeong Won.

560
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,410
Sis.

561
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,950
Can I come over for dinner tomorrow?

562
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:51,920
Of course, you can. Is there something you want to eat?

563
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,540
Do you want me to make braised kimchi?

564
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:57,240
No, not something we always eat.

565
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,880
I'd like something special like a steak.

566
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,050
Steak?

567
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:10,880
Fine. Since the brother I adore is asking, of course I'll make it.

568
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,560
I'll make it delicious for you. See you tomorrow.

569
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,620
- See you. 
 - Bye.

570
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,900
Please open the door for him.

571
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,090
- Welcome. 
 - Sis.

572
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,000
- Welcome, Jeong Won. 
 - Myeong Seop.

573
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,270
Let me introduce her to you.

574
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:20,420
This is my girlfriend.

575
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,600
Nice to meet you.

576
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,780
What was your relationship with Yoon Mi Ra?

577
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,830
I...

578
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,820
loved her.

579
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,530

580
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,580
 We have an amazing fate.

581
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,620
 How did you two meet?

582
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,650
 Should I say it was like destiny.

583
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:31,960
 True love sent by the heavens.

584
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,700
 I am warning you. Get away from my brother right now.

585
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:41,390
 Should I tell Jeong Won everything? That I was Shin Myeong Seop's mistress and was pregnant with his baby?

586
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:46,010
 You're the only one who understands me and makes me shine.

587
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,390
 Jeong Won, break up with Yoon Mi Ra.

588
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,260
 I can't let Mi Ra go.

589
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,730
 I'm going to marry her.

590
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,790
 Wake up, Han Jeong Won! She is a mistress!

591
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,800
 It's not like she was Myeong Seop's mistress.

592
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,370
 Myeong Seop.

593
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,770
 Don't you have anything to tell me?

594
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:11,270
