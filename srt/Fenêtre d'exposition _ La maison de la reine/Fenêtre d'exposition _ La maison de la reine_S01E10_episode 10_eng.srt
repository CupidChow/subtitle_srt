1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,110

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,290
Oh, Detective Kang. Take a look at this.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,090
There's someone the victim Yoon Mi Ra

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,120
met with before the incident.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,300
Huh?

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,980
Yes?

7
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,920
Doctor.

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,230
Dr. Cha Yeong Hoon.

9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,820
Yes. Who are you?

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm Detective Kang Dae Wook of Gangju Police Station's Violent Crimes Division 2.

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,100
You know Miss Yoon Mi Ra, don't you?

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,430
What's your relationship with her?

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,500
She was my patient.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,850
Did you know she was Shim Myeong Seop's mistress?

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,420
Yes.

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,290
But... she was your patient?

17
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,750
Is that a problem?

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,500
Wanting and craving someone's love,

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:40,450
it's wrong from the start if the other party has no intention of being in love.

20
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,240
In other words, love that's not meant to be.

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,700
On the day of the wedding vow renewal,

22
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,110
you met Yoon Mi Ra, didn't you?

23
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,250
Pretending to be happily married, pretending to be best friends,

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,770
pretending to be good neighbors, and pretending to be on the same side...

25
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,160
We all live with masks on.

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,620
Yes. That day, I did meet Yoon Mi Ra.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,880

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,420
I'll say this for the last time.

29
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,110
Go back home.

30
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,630
And...

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,750
where you're sitting right now,

32
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,690
I'll sit there instead.

33
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,330
You want to sit here?

34
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,720
In the seat of the chairperson?

35
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:39,010
As someone who's small-minded without any capacity but only full of petty tricks and ambitions,

36
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,130
you dare to covet the great LaReine Group's chairman position?

37
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,200
- Han Seon Joo. 
 - You right now...

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,210
Do you think you got this far on your own?

39
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,360
If I hadn't supported you from behind, if it hadn't been for my reputation,

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,480
do you think it would have been possible?

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm warning you. Don't drag out this situation.

42
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,840
Your LaReine might disappear completely.

43
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,150
Sister-in-Law...

44
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,370
Sister-in-Law...

45
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,010
Why... Why are you here?

46
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,650
How dare you come here?

47
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,900
Sister-in-Law...

48
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,600
Get rid of her this instant.

49
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,410
I said get rid of this thing! What are you doing?!

50
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,720
Sister-in-Law. Sister-in-Law, it's me!

51
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,880
- Please leave. 
 - You can't do this to me!

52
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,130
 How could you?!

53
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,090
Get the door.

54
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,080
- Ma'am. 
 - Mom!

55
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,790
Huh? What is she doing?

56
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,160
Just...

57
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,950
Just leave her alone.

58
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,880
Blood pressure, pulse, and breathing are all in the normal range.

59
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,070
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

60
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,190
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

61
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,380
Ma'am, your fiery temper is really charming.

62
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,410
But if you get excited like today, you'll be in big trouble.

63
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,970
I got it.

64
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,440
For now, don't worry about the company and get good rest.

65
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,850
You have Seon Joo and Jeong Won. You have nothing to worry about.

66
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,870
Also, the sooner you get better, the sooner you can go back to work.

67
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,100
- If you tell me to, I'd better listen, huh? 
 - Yes.

68
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,830
Yeong Hoon... I feel so relieved and thankful

69
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,940
that you're there for Seon Joo.

70
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,060
From now on, too, please don't betray her

71
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,580
and protect her.

72
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,850
Of course. I'll be next to her always. Don't worry.

73
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,960
Why not let your mom rest for a while?

74
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,010
She worked too hard without rest all this time.

75
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,020
Even machines break from overuse. It's worse for people.

76
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll think about it.

77
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,290
I'm always thankful for you, Yeong Hoon.

78
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,170
It makes me feel disappointed hearing you say that.

79
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,600
Let's not say such corny things between us.

80
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,440
Okay.

81
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,590
Oh right. We nearly got mentioned on TV over a scandal between you and me.

82
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,710
You had no idea, right?

83
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,520
What are you talking about?

84
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,090
Because of a ridiculous rumor, it nearly put us in an awkward spot.

85
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,190
Really?

86
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,150
You're the only one I can talk to about personal things...

87
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,830
If I lose you, too...

88
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,620
I can't bear to think about it.

89
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,280
After losing you to them,

90
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,230
I've never been able to sleep one night comfortably.

91
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,070
I missed you, and...

92
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,780
I wanted to touch you.

93
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,060
- Let me get that one. 
 - The sweet rice twist?

94
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,920
Just a second.

95
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,400
Thank you.

96
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,690
It's good.

97
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,900
- I will take some to go. 
 - Sure.

98
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,980
Let me get a mix of twists, beans, and citron.

99
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,090
Mom, you said you wanted to eat twisted bread, right?

100
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,650
Give one of these a try.

101
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,180
I wanted to eat something like this.

102
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,760
It suits my taste, possibly because I've only bought from this store for so long.

103
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
You have one as well.

104
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,280
Okay.

105
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,120
Mom,

106
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,690
to be honest, I was a bit surprised.

107
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,350
I thought you would never meet Dad again

108
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,360
whether he was dead or alive,

109
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,560
but I guess that wasn't true.

110
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,110
I also thought that if I heard the news that your father had died somewhere,

111
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,220
I would feel nothing.

112
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,820
But that didn't end up being true.

113
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,170
The bad memories have all faded,

114
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,440
I feel sorry,

115
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,420
and there's an aching feeling deep inside my chest.

116
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,720
But, Mom, that person at Father's memorial service,

117
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,570
she's that woman. Right?

118
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,160
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

119
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,720

♫  Anything is fine  ♫

125
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,350
This is a chair I really want to have.

126
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,590
Is it all right if I try sitting on it for a second?

127
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,270
No.

128
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,060
That chair has a different owner.

129
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,370
You can't sit there.

I'm not doing something useless, right?

136
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,020
Even if so, kinship...

137
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,710
is not something that can be broken off.

138
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,630
Kinship...

139
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,980
Go in and rest.

140
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,820
Thank you.

141
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,630
For finding my mother.

142
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,570
From now on, I will back you up.

143
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,160
It would be nice if you did that for me as well.

144
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,480
I'll be off.

145
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,250

146
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,790
Mother-in-Law is still unaware of the situation in the Philippines, correct?

147
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,520
Perhaps, if it's difficult for you to tell her, shall I deliver the news?

148
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,710
For the time being she needs to rest. Don't tell her anything.

149
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,420
Mother-in-Law is quite old, and she is unwell.

150
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,580
Would it not be better for her to retire now?

151
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,160
Isn't that your filial duty?

152
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Filial duty?

153
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,450
Not because of your greed?

154
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,070
My greed?

155
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,810
Well, I won't deny that.

156
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,720
From the start, did you marry me...

157
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,250
because of your greed for LaReine?

158
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,550
Didn't you also...

159
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:11,320
marry me because your family needed someone to be a loyal dog?

160
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,200
After being made to do LaReine's dirty work for so long,

161
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,600
I think I've done my best as a loyal dog.

162
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,810
Hasn't the time come for me to be compensated?

163
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,070
This was your true nature.

164
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,770
Dirty and hideous.

165
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,770
Is being true to your ambitions... dirty and hideous?

166
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,870
You too, Han Seon Joo, married me because you needed me.

167
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,510
Shin Myeong Seop.

168
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,100
Don't insult me.

169
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,560
Queen trap.

170
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,340
It appears that the queen is completely isolated.

171
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,810
I'll sleep at Mi Ra's tonight, and go straight to work tomorrow morning.

172
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,490
So are you becoming the chairman now?

173
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,300
Well... there is one last step left.

174
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,580
After you become the chairman, you'll marry me. Right?

175
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,720
Formalities aren't important.

176
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,950
Our love for each other is what's important.

177
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,690
Formality is important to me!

178
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,770
I want to stand confidently next to you and in front of the world.

179
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,340
How dare you come here?

180
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,830
Why, am I not supposed to come, Sister-in-Law?

181
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,810
Sister-in-Law?

182
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,370
Who let that woman in?

183
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,800
Please leave.

184
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
- Let go! Let go of me! 
 - Please get out.

185
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,470
Jeong Won...

186
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,770
I...

187
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:46,590
After hearing that Sister-in-Law was admitted to the hospital, I just came because I was worried...

188
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,610
This shameless thing...

189
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,840
I can't stand to see her anymore. Secretary Yoo, what are you doing?

190
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,270
- Jeong Won... Jeong Won. 
 - Please leave.

191
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,200
Please stop!

192
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,970
Isn't it enough you kept a mother and son apart for 30 years?

193
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,500
Please don't act rashly...

194
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,300
towards my mother.

195
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,960
What?

196
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,620
Jeong Won...

197
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,040
You...

198
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,480
Jeong Won! Jeong Won!

199
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,950
Go inside.

200
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,150
Hold on.

201
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,890
Eat something before you go.

202
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:01,710
I always wanted you to have some warm food I made myself.

203
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,360
You've suffered a lot all this time, haven't you?

204
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,050
I couldn't even begin to tell you how much...

205
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,440
Still... not being able to see you

206
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,180
was the most agonizing.

207
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,610
I... will become a devoted son to you from now on.

208
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,250
Thank you, Son.

209
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,180
Eat before it gets cold.

210
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,790
 Isn't it enough you kept a mother and son apart for 30 years?

211
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,700

212
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,030
 The call cannot be connected, so you will be forwarded to voicemail.

213
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,980
 You'll be charged after the beep.

214
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,790
 I think my Jeong Won totally turned his back from

215
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,340
 Chairwoman Kim Kang Im and Han Seon Joo.

216
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,570
He said he would be a devoted son to me.

217
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,070
Han Jeong Won isn't someone who would easily give his heart to anyone.

218
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,510
What do you mean "anyone." If not his mom,

219
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,280
who else would he open his heart to?

220
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,180
Anyway, keep me posted on what happens.

221
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,970
 Yes.

222
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,960
 By the way, President,

223
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:33,250
 the promised remainder of the balance... when will you...

224
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,790
I'll deposit it.

225
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,940
He met his mom after 30 years. I'm sure he has complicated feelings.

226
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,550
So, where is he?

227
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,480
I called him but he won't pick up.

228
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,290
He probably needs some time.

229
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,130
I know.

230
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,250
I know how he feels,

231
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,440
but how he left after saying such harsh things to Mom...

232
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,580
It was a little cruel.

233
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,030
He'll come back. He's your precious brother.

234
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,570
I... feel so pitiful.

235
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,020
I'm not doing my job at the company properly,

236
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,510
and I'm unable to take care of my kids because I'm too busy.

237
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,170
I'm a confused mess who can't even do one thing well.

238
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,550
I keep being flustered.

239
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,990
I feel so pathetic and dumb that...

240
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,100
it's driving me crazy.

241
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,820
There's something I want to show you.

242
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:36,240
Here. It's your very own chair I made myself.

243
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,190
It's not complete yet,

244
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,990
but it's a throne just for you.

245
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,500
A throne for Queen Han Seon Joo.

246
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,940
Since it's a throne, should I put some gold decorations on the back?

247
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,730
No way.

248
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,200
Where did you buy it? It's nice.

249
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,600
No, I really made it myself.

250
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,200
Look at the callouses.

251
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,560
Aren't you touched?

252
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,330
Try sitting in it.

253
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,980
Hurry up.

254
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,100
How is it?

255
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,540
It's nice. Really.

256
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,130
Whenever you get tired and worn out, come any time.

257
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,790
Come and rest comfortably.

258
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,260
Seon Joo.

259
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,630
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

260
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:13,510
♫  for you to see I’m no company  ♫

261
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:20,220
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

262
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,860
♫  I guess you don't know that.  ♫

263
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,490
♫   I guess how I feel  ♫

264
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,750
♫  I bet my love can't compensate no more  ♫

265
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:43,740
♫  I think all that’s in my head has been replaced somehow  ♫

266
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,670
 What do you want to do?

267
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,150
 I'm going to bear with it with all that I have.

268
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,040
♫  I think I need more oxygen to breathe  ♫

269
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,000
 But Yeong Hoon...

270
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,750
 it's so hard...

271
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,050
♫  Heaven made  ♫

272
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,140
♫  Save the days  ♫

273
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,820
♫  These walls can come right over me like I’m insane  ♫

274
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,570
♫  I’ve loved someone like I could never love again  ♫

275
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,410
I have an appointment. I'm Yoon Mi Ra.

276
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,400
Yes, I confirmed your appointment.

277
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,010
Please take care of me well.

278
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,810
Of course, we will do our very best.

279
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,930
- Is it okay? 
 - Yes.

280
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,240
I have really needed this lately. It feels great.

281
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,180
Thank you. I'll do my best for you.

282
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,350
I'll come often from now on.

283
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,300
Thank you.

284
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,370

285
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,910
Hey!

286
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,400
Isn't that Mi Ra?

287
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,400
Isn't it our first time seeing her after she broke off her engagement to Seon Joo's brother?

288
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,060
I was so happy not seeing her.

289
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,560
Why is she back? It's annoying.

290
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,060
Look at her clothes.

291
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,390
I can tell just by looking at her. She got herself another guy.

292
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,290
How did it go with the emergency capital loan?

293
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,960
We applied for it at the main bank...

294
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,180
but it was rejected.

295
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,390
You're saying that LaReine was rejected for a loan?

296
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,790
Stock prices fell sharply due to the prolonged strike in the Philippines.

297
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:24,390
Rather than a loan, we were notified to repay our existing loans.

298
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,390
All right.

299
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,610
 Yes, this is Han Jeong Won.

300
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,610
Team Leader Han, come to the Chairman's office.

301
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,510
 I am afraid I cannot right now.

302
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,520
The Philippines problem is serious, let's discuss it.

303
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,610
I am sorry, but discuss it with someone else,

304
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,160
 Chairwoman Han Seon Joo.

305
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,990
Jeong Won.

306
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,610
It was Chairwoman Han. She wanted to see me regarding the Phillippines factory issue.

307
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,350
Please relay to me the domestic situation.

308
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,500
That is...

309
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,990
Team Leader Han is also on our side now.

310
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,770
Chief Director Han Seon Joo has begun operating the Vietnam factory in place of the Philippine factory,

311
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,510
Since the products were made suddenly, the proportion of defective products is quite high.

312
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,680
As a result, there are complaints from companies.

313
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,370
What about the legal issues?

314
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:59,000
If this continues, we'll be swamped with lawsuits, let alone get a renewal contract.

315
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,550
What do you think of going personally to the Philippines factory?

316
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,250
If the group's representative actively participates in the strike issue, the local response will be positive.

317
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,860
Then, later on, your contribution to resolving the issue will be added to your achievements.

318
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,270
I'm not sure.

319
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,630
When there's a deputy chairwoman,

320
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,000
wouldn't it look a bit strange for me to step in?

321
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,460
I'm also not sure if I'm the right person to represent LaReine.

322
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,470
Is there anyone more suited for the chairman position than you?

323
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,840
If you are willing to go, then I will take care of it myself.

324
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,770
Were you looking for me?

325
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,040
You take care of the Philippines strike.

326
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,520
Is that an order?

327
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,590
It's a business directive.

328
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,800
As the LaReine chairman's representative.

329
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,920
It's a business directive given to the president.

330
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,890
All right. I will take care of it.

331
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:52,820
But this is the last directive you will give to me.

332
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,910
After this issue is taken care of...

333
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,670
hand over your position to me.

334
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,970
And you go back home.

335
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,160
All right.

336
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,440
First, you take care of the issues here.

337
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,700
Resolve the penalty issue right away.

338
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,300
If you don't, we'll face the biggest crisis since LaReine Group's founding.

339
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,190
And until the strike issue has been handled,

340
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,200
get a sufficient amount of secured loans.

341
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,870
Is the chairwoman doing well?

342
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,260
Even if I want to visit her...

343
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't want to show her my weak self.

344
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,010
Mother will also think about you, Director Choi.

345
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,890
As the founding members, you both are close.

346
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,070
Uh... Chairwoman.

347
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:45,860
Did you.... get the emergency funds?

348
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,590
About that... it's not easy.

349
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,680
In Hong Kong, there is a hedge fund

350
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,120
called Silverstone.

351
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,640
A hedge... fund?

352
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,400
I cannot say it is a safe source of money,

353
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,400
but it can be quite useful when you need it.

354
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,440
I looked into it a bit.

355
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,930
With your stock as collateral,

356
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,700
you can get a 50 billion won emergency loan.

357
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,670
However, there is a condition that you have to pay it back within a month.

358
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,790
First, get the loan,

359
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,790
take care of immediate matters,

360
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:42,110
and when the factory operations return to normal,

361
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,700
the funds will come in and I think you will be able to surely pay it back.

362
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,370
I had no idea.

363
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:16,310
That the chairman and Seon Joo were standing in the way of me and my mother.

364
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,850
My entire life feels like...

365
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:27,630
it's been a joke and unfair.

366
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:46,690
Brother-in-law, did you never think

367
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,180
of acquiring the LaReine Group?

368
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,880
You are the only son of LaReine.

369
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,140
Is there anyone who lives without ambitions?

370
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,780
But as you know,

371
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,030
all this time I was like a shadow.

372
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,710
Someone who didn't get in the way of the chairwoman.

373
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,900
An existence that was there and not there at the same time.

374
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,500
But now, I want to have it.

375
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,450
LaReine.

376
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,540
Yes.

377
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,240
Get rid of the sadness you've experienced all this time.

378
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,710
On that note, shall we cheer?

379
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,500
Dad, when will you be back from the business trip?

380
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,800
It won't take too long.

381
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,120
The teacher is waiting, get in the car.

382
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,860
Have a safe trip, Dad.

383
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,150
All right. Study hard.

384
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,060
Then, I will leave.

385
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,880
Seon Joo. Hi.

386
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,020
These days it's hard to see you.

387
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,940
Did you quit the Tango Club?

388
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,130
I should start coming again.

389
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,060
Mi Ra came to the Queen's Club.

390
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,120
Yoon Mi Ra went to the Queen's Club?

391
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,140
You didn't know?

392
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,320
Well, there is no reason you would have known.

393
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,780
Okay then, I'll see you later. Bye.

394
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,710
Leave my luggage in that house.

395
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,710
Yes, Sir.

396
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,780
Good work, Brother-in-Law.

397
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,520
Thanks to you, we could solve the strike issue easily.

398
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,730
I don't know why such an easily solvable problem was so hard to solve.

399
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:54,930
That's all experience and knowledge.

400
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:58,260
How do you think I got to where I am?

401
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,460
That's true.

402
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,070
Okay, you go rest today. See you at the office tomorrow.

403
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,550
All right.

404
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,090
It's me. I am in front of the house.

405
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,030
Don't worry, because the strike problem has been solved.

406
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,600
I can't come home today.

407
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,650
- Gallery? 
 - Yes.

408
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,870
Leave the academy and give the gallery a try.

409
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,810
How can I work at the gallery?

410
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:06,200
You majored in art and also have the sense.

411
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,360
What can't you do?

412
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:17,150
Honestly... I desperately wanted to try it.

413
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,230
I'll do well. I'll work hard.

414
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,200
Yes, I know you can do well, Mi Ra.

415
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,380
Thank you so much.

416
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,710
Why are you so moved by this?

417
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,720
Honestly, all this time, I always felt bad for forcing you to make sacrifices.

418
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,070
Now, do everything you have wanted to do

419
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,480
because I will support you.

420
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:03,560
Also, this gallery has an important meaning to us, so we have to do well.

421
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,420
Important meaning?

422
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,420
Never mind. I'll tell you later.

423
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,470

424
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,150
What happened on the TV show?

425
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:18,610
I clearly told you to expose your scandal with Shin Myeong Seop.

426
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:24,980
Wasn't Shin Myeong Seop and Han Seon Joo's break up your goal anyway?

427
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:30,870
Is it important whether it's Shin Myeong Seop's and my scandal, or yours and Han Seon Joo's?

428
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,720
It is different.

429
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,450
I don't want Seon Joo to get hurt.

430
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,120
The same goes for me.

431
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,470
I can never do things that hurt Myeong Seop.

432
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,520
Then, what we both want is becoming more and more different.

433
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:57,080
Then, I have to send those photos to another place.

434
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,490
It would be better not to do anything

435
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,410
that wasn't told of you.

436
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,380
- Does it taste good? 
 - Yes.

437
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,050
Eat a lot.

438
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,490
Mom.

439
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,160
You're home.

440
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,620
I will see you tomorrow.

441
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,170
- Goodbye. 
 - Thank you for your work. 
 - Goodbye.

442
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:42,000
Tae Hee, are you not going to greet me?

443
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,540
Are you an old person or what? Always asking for a greeting.

444
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,010
What did you just say?

445
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,370
"You're home." Are you happy now?

446
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,010
Stop right there!

447
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,810
- Shin Tae Hee. 
 - Mom.

448
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,380
Sis is sensitive these days. Leave her alone.

449
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,860
What's wrong with you?

450
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,120
I am already having a hard time.

451
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,420
- Get out. 
 - Shin Tae Hee.

452
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:39,260
All right. I admit that I disappointed you.

453
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,700
I couldn't pay attention because I suddenly had to work even though I didn't want to.

454
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,120
Forgetting Tae Yong's birthday, and not taking care of you properly, I apologize for everything.

455
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,960
- So, Tae Hee... 
 - Do you think that's the reason?

456
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,600
Then, why are you like this?

457
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:04,560
Mom, are you dating Mr. Cha Yeong Hoon?

458
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,360
What?

459
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,840
Where did this photo come from?

460
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,660
Is that important right now?

461
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,880
What is your relationship with this person?

462
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,190
Is that why you kicked out Dad?

463
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,840
To divorce our dad?

464
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,130
I want to be alone, so leave.

465
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,550
Dad.

466
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,930
- Where is Tae Hee? 
 - She is in her room.

467
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,380
Tae Yong go upstairs now.

468
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,800
Yes, go up.

469
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,280
Is this also Yoon Mi Ra's doing?

470
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,340
Tae Hee asked me what my relationship is... with Yeong Hoon.

471
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,300
My daughter suspects me when you did all the dirty things.

472
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,480
Does this make sense?

473
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,170
Is a physical affair the only kind of affair?

474
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,530
What?

475
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,680
Is an emotional affair not considered an affair?

476
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,580
Whenever something happens,

477
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,290
you run to Cha Yeong Hoon.

478
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,340
When your husband is here.

479
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,880
What?

480
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,220
You always did that.

481
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,860
When there's a difficulty, you look for Cha Yeong Hoon before me.

482
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,120
Is talking to a friend about difficulties a mistake?

483
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,620
A mental exchange with a friend is not something to be criticized for.

484
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:44,060
You call that a filthy affair?

485
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,030
Judging others by your own standards...

486
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:50,670
Who knows if all you did was talk?

487
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,300
What are you saying?

488
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,680
Whether it was purely just an emotional exchange,

489
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:05,990
or... if there was a physical exchange as well.

490
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,510
Shin Myeong Seop.

491
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Mi Ra, did you send a photo to Tae Hee?

492
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,300
Photo? What photo?

493
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,010
The photo where Cha Yeong Hoon and Han Seon Joo were together, did you send it?

494
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,730
It wasn't me. Why would I?

495
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,100
Maybe it's the paparazzi

496
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,600
or there must be a lot of people who have a grudge against Han Seon Joo.

497
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,700
Is that so?

498
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,520
I'm thinking of opening an art charity auction.

499
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,380
Art charity auction?

500
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,980
The first project of the LaReine gallery.

501
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:32,140
There were lots of nice paintings in storage that have collected dust.

502
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,480
A percentage of the sales from the paintings can be donated to a charity

503
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,830
and the rest could be used as the gallery's operating funds. What do you think?

504
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,210
Sounds good.

505
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,700
The auction will be held at the Queen's Club.

506
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,880
Why not at the gallery?

507
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,010
Since most of the regulars at our gallery are women who belong to Queen's Club.

508
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:59,860
I think it would be more effective than inviting them to the gallery.

509
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,690
Do as you please.

510
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,890
Chief, what is going on?

511
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,030
Why Yoon Mi Ra?

512
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,000
Oka, got it.

513
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,110
What is this about?

514
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:34,430
Did you make Yoon Mi Ra the gallery's director?

515
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,110
Why? Is there a problem?

516
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,350
- According to who...? 
 - Me.

517
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:44,290
- What? 
 - Even if it's temporary, I am the chairman of LaReine.

518
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:49,530
You know that the chairman has full authority over personnel affairs in the group.

519
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:56,170
Is that why the first thing you did as the chairman, was to put your mistress in charge of the gallery?

520
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,960
I had to find the right person to fill the empty position anyway.

521
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,670
Is Yoon Mi Ra the right person?

522
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:08,550
Of course, she still has little experience and no accomplishments, but she's got good acumen and sense.

523
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,010
She is pretty smart at work.

524
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,840
It sounds like you are going all out carrying out your affair.

525
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:23,380
How can someone be this shameless?

526
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:37,480
Honey, stop thinking so rigidly and be more flexible.

527
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,110
I'll never abandon my family no matter what.

528
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:46,120
I am going to do my best for you and our kids.

529
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,540
That also, very faithfully.

530
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:54,510
But... I love Mi Ra, too.

531
00:58:55,310 --> 00:59:00,350
She's as important as you are to me.

532
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,790
Is that something you should say in front of me?

533
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:11,260
You and I, and Mi Ra...

534
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,150
Like this, the three of us,

535
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,030
can coexist normally and happily.

536
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,780
Coexist?

537
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,720
Did you just say coexist?

538
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
Yes, coexist.

539
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,970
The three of us. No, even including our kids. All of us.

540
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:38,180
I think we can be happy.

541
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,010
We all live together in this world.

542
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:51,160
You have gone completely crazy.

543
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:47,420

544
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:10,010

545
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:35,040
What happened? Are you sure you properly sent the invitations?

546
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,290
Yes, we did.

547
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,300
Charity Auction?

548
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,570
The pitiful person who needs charity is right here.

549
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,500
Were you even invited?

550
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,530
Get yourself together, you woman.

551
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,630
It looks like you want to play the Queen, imitating Han Seon Joo.

552
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,360
Do you think a maid can become a queen just because she changes clothes?

553
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,880
Shut your mouth. Don't use your mouth rashly.

554
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,000
Shut my mouth?

555
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,100
Han Seon Joo is holding a cultural event at the seminar hall right now.

556
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,860
All the Queen's Club members are there.

557
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,530
Go there, if you are curious.

558
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,380
Ridiculous...

559
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:31,300
This problem is a reality that directly touches those who (in French)

560
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:38,210
raise their children and can lead the global trend first.

561
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:40,140
Yes.

562
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:45,920
What are some promising jobs in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution?

563
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,680
This problem is a reality that touches those of you who raise children very directly

564
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,690
Come in and sit down. We just started.

565
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:26,140
I said that you were the leader of tomorrow's world.

566
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,350
Han Seon Joo.

567
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,610
Thank you.

568
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,830
How did you get in here?

569
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:42,220
What do you mean? Mrs. Kim opened the door for me.

570
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,700
Did I come somewhere I can't?

571
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,870
Why are you doing this?

572
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,150
Don't get angry.

573
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:55,270
I came to surprise you.

574
01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:59,870
I'll leave if you kiss me.

575
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:01,570
Quickly.

576
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:08,990

577
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,400
We have a witness.

578
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:26,790
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

579
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:34,740
♫  for you to see I’m no company  ♫

580
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:42,210
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

581
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:49,410
♫  I guess you don't know that. I guess how I feel  ♫

582
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,550
♫  I bet my love can't compensate no more  ♫

583
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,310

584
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,960
 What's Auntie Mi Ra up to?

585
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,990
 We became pretty close. I miss Auntie Mi Ra.

586
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:07,000
 Why don't you invite her over some time for dinner? Doesn't that sound good, Dad?

587
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,400
 Why, does that make you uncomfortable?

588
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,500
 No.

589
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,050
 You didn't say anything to Tae Hee, did you?

590
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:19,230
 Like what? That you and Yoon Mi Ra are having an affair?

591
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:20,680
 Watch what you say.

592
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,330
 It's not my fault alone that we became like this.

593
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,940
 Mi Ra, there's something you need to do for me.

594
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,800
 It says access is restricted.

595
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,660
 Only a few people including Chairwoman Kim Kang Im and Chief Director Han Seon Joo–

596
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:36,490
 Do you still not get it? I'm the one who's in charge of your livelihood.

597
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,910
 Tell me the truth.

598
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,940
 I would never without your permission, Chairwoman.

599
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:45,130
 Director Shin Myeong Seop

600
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:52,280
♫  I loved someone like I could never love again  ♫
