1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,880


2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,860

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,120
Mom and Dad, can you do it alone? We don't want to.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,280
Today, everyone in our family is the main character.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,810
So bear with it for just a little while.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,720
- All right, we'll be late. Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,710

8
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,300
 I heard that you and Yoon Mi Ra

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,270
 kissed in our house.

10
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,820
 Tae Hee told me.

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,850
 You should have been more careful.

12
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,640
 So I thought it over,

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,030
 and on our wedding anniversary,

14
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,470
 what if we have a remind wedding?

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,800
 Remind wedding?

16
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,670
 You and I,

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,340
 reflecting on our feelings from when we first got married.

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
  With that meaning. And above all,

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,980
 to show Tae Hee that what happened

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,270
 was nothing but a passing wind.

21
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,460
 I want to assure her that our family has no problems,

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,270
 and no changes whatsoever.

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,900
 I also want to show others that our marriage

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,690
 is very solid.

25
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,850
 Eun Kyeong said that

26
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,990
 people in the Queen's Club

27
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,890
 are betting on when we will divorce.

28
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,710
 Betting?

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,660
 What do you...

30
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,810
 think about it?

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,930
 Since we bought stocks from Silverstone without knowing they were Director Choi's,

32
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,560
 the slush fund in our possession has almost been fully exhausted.

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,410
 Chairwoman Kim Kang Im is calling Director Choi and other founding senior directors

34
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,250
 to the detention center one-by-one, and meeting with them.

35
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,430
 I'm beginning to think that they may have gotten wind of our plan, and are preparing countermeasures.

36
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,020
 Let's do it, the remind wedding.

37
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,080
Mom, you're so pretty!

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,060
You look very handsome as well.

39
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,320
Tae Hee, you look so pretty.

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,860
I think it's time for us to go.

41
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,530
Let's go.

42
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,380

43
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,580
Yoon Mi Ra.

44
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,780
Yoon Mi Ra.

45
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,600
Where are you now?

46
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,780
Did you think that I didn't know you were blocking my eyes and ears?

47
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,540
What are you talking about?

48
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,070
Today is Han Seon Joo and Shin Myeong Seop's remind wedding.

49
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,900
How did you know?

50
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,830
I was invited by Han Seon Joo.

51
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,580
Don't do anything foolish and come back immediately.

52
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm done cooperating with you.

53
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,310

54
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,200

55
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,100

56
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,990

57
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,740
- Why are you here? 
 - Because I should be.

58
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,210
- Come with me. 
 - I'm going over there.

59
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,900
Think of it rationally and let's find a different method!

60
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,880
I can't trust you anymore.

61
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,980
- This is not a good method! 
 - Good method?

62
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,110
Is doing what you want a good method?

63
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,370
If you go out stubbornly like this, you won't be able to gain anything!

64
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,380
No, today is the day when everything finally ends.

65
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,610
The boring fight up until this point... is about to end.

66
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,430
Look here, Yoon Mi Ra! Please stop!

67
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,100
You also wanted desperately for the two of them to break apart, more than anyone else!

68
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,910
Let go! Let go!

69
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,580
Let go of me!

70
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,890
What are you doing right now?

71
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,920
I can't just sit and watch you hurt Seon Joo anymore.

72
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,450
What an impressive pure love.

73
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,820
Now I see that the reason you hid me

74
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,550
wasn't for our collaboration, but because you were trapping me in case I harassed Han Seon Joo?

75
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,610
Stop the car.

76
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,370
Stop the car immediately!

77
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,700
- What are you doing! 
 - Turn around!

78
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,260
Let go!  Let go of this!

79
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,320
I said to turn the car around!

80
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,850
Do you... want to die?!

81
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,230
You can't stop me.

82
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,750
Because even if you stop me now, I will go to Han Seon Joo by any means.

83
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,440
Before killing me, you will never be able to stop me.

84
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,100

85
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,140
 You look very handsome today!

86
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,060
 Thank you for coming.

87
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,490
 Oh, thank you!

88
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,130
Everything is perfect, it's so nice to see!

89
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,260
Nice to see? It's all for show.

90
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,730
I just don't understand...

91
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,340
Do you think this makes sense? A remind wedding?

92
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,620
Why? People do it all the time these days. Remind wedding.

93
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,730
I'm not saying it because I don't know that.

94
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,480
It's just that Kim Kang Im is locked up in jail right now...

95
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,900
What's the deal with the remind wedding?

96
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,730
Well, it is a bit questionable.

97
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,960
Something is off...

98
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,130
This just doesn't look right.

99
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,520
Is there anyone here who can honorably condemn

100
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,070
Han Seon Joo's marriage?

101
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,650
What I mean is, let's behave appropriately.

102
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,060
Please. This high-class food and expensive wine,

103
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,790
you're all enjoying it for free today.

104
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,420
In return, shouldn't you give today's main characters

105
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,710
a cheap smile, at the very least?

106
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,560
All right, with that in mind,

107
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,570
everybody, cheers!

108
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,410
 Cheers. Cheers.

109
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,330
I told you to stop taking pictures.

110
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,010
Why?

111
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,300
If I tell you to stop, just stop.

112
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,750
I just wanted to show Jeong Kook and the guys.

113
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,950
Why would you show them mom and dad's remind wedding?

114
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,120
They keep teasing me, saying that my parents are getting divorced.

115
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,140
Why would your parents get divorced?

116
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,110
That won't happen, Tae Yong. So, don't pay attention to what others say.

117
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,240
Ridiculous kids. Ignore them.

118
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,390
But... have you seen your mom?

119
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,440
Usually, the star appears at the very end.

120
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,620
That's right.

121
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,060

122
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,320
Oh, it's Seon Joo!

123
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,490
Uncle, didn't you bring cheese?

124
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,730
Cheese that was specially flown in from Italy.

125
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,580
That's right.

126
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,580
I think you left it behind in the kitchen.

127
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,630
I must have been pretty out of it. I'll be right back.

128
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,020
Come on...

129
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,910
Yoon Mi Ra...

130
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,870
Long time no see.

131
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,010
I hear news every once in a while.

132
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,900
As expected, you're impressive. Showing up here.

133
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,670
I could say the same about you.

134
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,530
What made you think to stand on Executive Director Shin Myeong Seop's side

135
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,730
while knowing all about our relationship?

136
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,550
Me choosing Executive Director Shin,

137
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,560
has absolutely nothing to do with you.

138
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
I wonder if that's really true.

139
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,260
Do you want to die?

140
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,630
I came here as a guest after being formally invited by your sister.

141
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,200
Please be respectful.

142
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,770
Something very interesting is about to happen.

143
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,050
Look forward to it.

144
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,820
Stop... testing me.

145
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,180
Stab me, if you can.

146
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,400
 Uncle!

147
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,530
Stay here.

148
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,780
Don't move.

149
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,800
Because if you do anything stupid, I'll really kill you.

150
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,440
Uncle! Are you in the kitchen?

151
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,900
Yeah.

152
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,790
I'm done now, let's go.

153
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,240

154
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,300
You look so beautiful today, Seon Joo.

155
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,560
I know, right?

156
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,670
Thank you all for coming.

157
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,330
We are all so thankful to have been invited!

158
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,830
- Uncle! I'll go meet with a friend and be right back. 
 - Okay.

159
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,280
Wow, I'm so jealous!

160
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,340
Unnie, you are really the best!

161
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,790
Everything is so perfect!

162
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,320
Cheese.

163
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,210
It looks good.

164
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,590
Then, I'll leave you all to talk.

165
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,030
Yoon Mi Ra showed up.

166
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,460
She's in the house right now.

167
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,990
You finally appeared.

168
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,230
Since you didn't respond,

169
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,890
I was beginning to doubt

170
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,340
that you would come.

171
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,070
You went so far as to invite me intentionally,

172
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,980
I had to come.

173
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,040
Wow...

174
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,970
What a harmonious picture...

175
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,390
When people find out that that smile was a show window, what will they say?

176
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,080
I'm curious.

177
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,650
Where were you hiding, all that time?

178
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,900
Did you happen to worry about me?

179
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,960
As if.

180
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,530
I'm disappointed.

181
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,960
There was a time when we were quite close.

182
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,900
Why are you having a remind wedding instead of getting divorced?

183
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,820
Did you bring a gift?

184
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,690
A gift?

185
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,640
The original gallery transaction data,

186
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,270
hand it over.

187
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,680
I am sure I said I'd give it to you if you got divorced.

188
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,220
No,

189
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,590
the gallery transaction breakdown will be first.

190
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,680
No,

191
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,120
- the divorce will be first. 
 - If I get divorced,

192
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,210
you will give the original version to Shin Myeong Seop.

193
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,900
Like the data on the Chinese counterfeit brokers last time.

194
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,360
The choice is yours.

195
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,500
Hand over the gallery data to me.

196
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,430
Then... I'll go and announce the divorce in front of everyone, right now.

197
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,280
That's why I invited you here.

198
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,470
What do you think?

199
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,000
How can I believe that?

200
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,570
I don't say things I don't mean.

201
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,900
Looks like it's starting now.

202
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,060
What to do? I have to go to the party.

203
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,870
Han Seon Joo!

204
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,980

205
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,710

206
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,320
I, Shin Myeong Seop,

207
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,480
vow to love and respect my one and only wife,

208
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,900
Han Seon Joo, forever.

209
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,770
I, Han Seon Joo, vow to

210
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,360
love and respect my one and only husband, Shin Myeong Seop,

211
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,190
forever.

212
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,120

213
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,870
Uncle! Your hand is bleeding!

214
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,850
Oh, yeah!

215
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,670
I cut myself while slicing the cheese.

216
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,090
You should be more careful! Go inside and put medicine on it.

217
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,180
No, I'm fine.

218
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,250
Should I at least go get you a band-aid?

219
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,970
It's all right.

220
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,700
I should go get more dessert. I'll be right back.

221
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,790
Hey, I downloaded the new Emperor's Door game.

222
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,930
Wow! Really? I'm so jealous, that must be nice.

223
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,000
I have a game pack too, do you want to borrow it?

224
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,690
Really? When will you give it to me? I'll lend it tomorrow.

225
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,200
No... Now, now.

226
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,140
Please... my friend! Hurry hurry!

227
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,360
Okay.

228
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,170
Wait here for a second, I'll go get it.

229
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,310
I'll go get it for you.

230
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,080
I was going to go home to get a band-aid.

231
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,500
I will bring it on my way back.

232
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,490

233
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,230
 Oh! Look at that!

234
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,880
 Wow!

235
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,300
 My goodness!

236
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,600
 That's so cool!

237
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,520
 Oh, how pretty!

238
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,360
Look over there!

239
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,520
 It's so beautiful... Pretty.

240
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,860
- Hello! 
 - You came over?

241
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,620
I will fill each of your glasses.

242
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,400
Thank you.

243
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,100
Thank you.

244
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,260
Isn't this top-shelf Chateau de Luins?

245
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,970
As expected, I can say confidently that

246
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,520
CEO Shin's taste is really high-end!

247
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,290
You have a glass, as well.

248
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,100
Should I?

249
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,600
I'll pour you a glass.

250
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,140
Wow, Chateau de Luins.

251
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,390
All right.

252
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,080
Shall we toast?

253
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,140

254
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
What about mom?

255
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,520
Oh, she was here just a moment ago.

256
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,750
 What's wrong?

257
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,370
 What's happening?

258
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,400
Mi Ra!

259
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,090
Mi Ra.

260
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,380
Seon Joo.

261
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,780
- Mom. 
 - Mom.

262
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,870
Mom.

263
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,920
 Oh my!

264
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,170
 Mom.

265
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,060

266
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,880

267
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,490
It's not Jeong Won.

268
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:54,360
You might want to believe Brother-in-Law,

269
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,120
but it's not a matter of belief.

270
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:05,160
It's about the accident that happened to us and our reality.

271
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,270
Why are you looking at me like that?

272
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,970
By any chance, are you suspecting me?

273
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,520
Because it's not me.

274
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,210
Mi Ra. She is as precious as you are to me.

275
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:42,530
Although I don't know who it was, I can never forgive the culprit.

276
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,310
You all go back now that the witness investigation is completed.

277
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,600
But I will be calling you back soon, so don't go too far.

278
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,220
All right.

279
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,990

280
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,610

281
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,120

282
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,420
Yes.

283
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,280
That day, I had met with Yoon Mi Ra.

284
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,820

285
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,090

286
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,800

287
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:11,030
Han Seon Joo knew that Yoon Mi Ra was Shin Myeong Seop's mistress.

288
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,520

289
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,550
 But Shin Myeong Seop continued to meet Yoon Mi Ra.

290
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,660
She was holding a knife with blood at the crime scene.

291
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,210
 But she said she didn't stab her.

292
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,030

293
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,960
 Han Jeong Won even promised to marry Yoon Mi Ra.

294
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,390
 He canceled the marriage after getting to know she was his brother-in-law's mistress.

295
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,960
 And they met again at the Remind Wedding.

296
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,260

297
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,540
 Han Seon Joo's best friend Cha Yeong Hoon

298
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:05,430
 already knew Yoon Mi Ra's identity from a long time.

299
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,940
 Somebody had stabbed Yoon Mi Ra

300
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,150
but they all say they didn't do it?

301
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,610
So, she was her husband's mistress

302
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,290
and was to get married to her brother, but they broke up.

303
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,140
Han Seon Joo's best friend had a one-sided love for her for a long time.

304
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,620
And that friend had some kind of a relationship with Yoon Mi Ra.

305
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,790
After obviously knowing that her husband was cheating, she held a remind wedding.

306
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:47,370
And that day of all days, her husband's mistress was stabbed by somebody?

307
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,490
What is all this?

308
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,910
It's a hell of a story.

309
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,250
Gosh, my head hurts.

310
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,370

311
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,580
Are forensic results out?

312
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,340
What?

313
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,060
Han Seon Joo, we arrest you on charges of attempted murder.

314
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,030
Han Seon Joo, you have the right to remain silent.

315
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,000
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,

316
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,560
you have the right to get yourself a lawyer.

317
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,270
What's wrong, Mom?

318
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,350
Mom, who are these people?

319
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,730
Honey.

320
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,300
Take the children inside.

321
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,450
I will come back soon.

322
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,380
All right. Let's go inside.

323
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,770
 Let us go.

324
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,680
 What's wrong?

325
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,910
What's happening?

326
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,270
 Oh no! That's Seon Joo!

327
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,320
 Oh my.

328
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,980
Let's have a talk.

329
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,940
Your fingerprints were found on this knife.

330
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,740
It's not me.

331
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,070
Are you going to keep denying it even though there's evidence here?

332
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,730
This knife...

333
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,860
is our kitchen knife.

334
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,610
Of course, my fingerprints would be found on it!

335
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,560
Right, that would make sense.

336
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,830
But that's not everything.

337
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,610
Your DNA being found under Yoon Mi Ra's nails,

338
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,720
how will you explain that?

339
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,300

340
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,000
 It's starting now.

341
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,130
 What do I do? I need to go to the party.

342
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,980
 Han Seon Joo.

343
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,140
 Deadline is until today's party ends.

344
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,810
 Decide by then.

345
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,090
Your fingerprints have been detected from the knife.

346
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:12,460
Your DNA has been detected under Yoon Mi Ra's nails.

347
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,530
Would you still deny it?

348
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,420
Detective.

349
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:27,550
What?

350
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,100
What are you saying?

351
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,620
There was a call from the Forensic Team.

352
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,490
They said the depth and width of wounds on the victim's body were slightly different.

353
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,200
Then are you saying that the knife we found is not the crime weapon?

354
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,720
Then, what's the real crime weapon?

355
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,610
A witness has appeared.

356
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,700
I.... saw.

357
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,910
The culprit.

358
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,090
You saw the culprit?

359
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,830

360
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:55,130
Hello?

361
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,130
Pardon?

362
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,840

363
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,200
Don't worry too much.

364
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,660
I'll contact the legal team and prepare for our defense.

365
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,700
Seon Joo.

366
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,710
Tae Yong?

367
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,200
Mom and Dad.

368
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,480
I knew everything.

369
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,320
So, I stabbed that woman.

370
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,800
What?

371
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,180
Can't be...

372
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,400
Tae Yong.

373
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,540
 Tae Yong.

374
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,470
Tae Yong.

375
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,330
You didn't. You didn't do it.

376
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,470
You could never...

377
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,570
You didn't do it, right?

378
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:18,420
Mom, I did stab her.

379
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,450
Why are you doing this exactly?

380
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,960
I...

381
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,750
I knew everything.

382
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,090
The relationship between that woman, Yoon Mi Ra, and Dad.

383
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,840
What?

384
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,420
I heard your conversation with Tae Hee.

385
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,530
And what that woman did to you.

386
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,640
That's why I stabbed her. To kill her.

387
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,490
No.

388
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,080
No way.

389
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,940
There's no way you would've done it.

390
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,690
It can't be.

391
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,550
No, Tae Yong.

392
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,720
No. It's not you, no way.

393
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,520
Tae Yong, no.

394
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,010
No.

395
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,600
Take him and go.

396
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,540
Come this way.

397
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,140
Honey.

398
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,350
Lawyer Ahn will take up our son's case.

399
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,890
I am Shin Tae Yong's attorney, Ahn Do Hyeok.

400
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,840
I'm sure you're aware, but since Shin Tae Yong is a minor, his guardian, who are his parents,

401
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,320
and the attorney's presence is required for investigation.

402
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,200
Yes.

403
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,240
Additionally, since the suspect, Shin Tae Yong,

404
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,340
is a minor, he can't be responsible.

405
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,370
He won't be criminally liable.

406
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,330
I am aware.

407
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:18,020
Where is my son?

408
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:27,630
Can you tell us what happened that day?

409
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,270
I was going to give Jeong Gook my new game.

410
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,130
 I was going to go home to get a band-aid.

411
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,100
 I will bring it on my way back.

412
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,170
 Okay.

413
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,010
 Wait. I'll just go myself.

414
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,300
 Hi.

415
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,510
 Why are you here?

416
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:13,350
 It's a family party, so of course I should be here.

417
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,740
 Get lost, right now.

418
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,050
 You shouldn't...

419
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,530
 speak so rudely to adults.

420
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,770
 You think I don't know?

421
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:35,720
 What you did to my mom and our family?

422
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,160
 You think I don't know?

423
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,160
 Don't torture our family anymore.

424
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,000
 Get lost.

425
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,140
 You are still young, so you don't know the world of adults.

426
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,330
 Don't act up.

427
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:50,400
No...

428
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,610
It can't be...

429
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,190
That couldn't be...

430
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,090
Something is wrong.

431
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,720
That could never have happened. This isn't right.

432
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,460
No.

433
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,710
It's not true, right?

434
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:03,420
So you stabbed Yoon Mi Ra?

435
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,230
Yes.

436
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,350
Why? Why did you stab her?

437
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,080
Because I hated her.

438
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,710
I wanted to kill her.

439
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,980
Where?

440
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,090
How did you stab her?

441
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,380
Stomach.

442
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,140
I stabbed her twice in the stomach.

443
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,390
Here.

444
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,420
And here.

445
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:20,010
Did you stab her with this knife?

446
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,480
Yes.

447
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,260
Are you sure?

448
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,350
Yes, I am sure.

449
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:32,010

00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:40,760

455
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,900
 The tears are just coming out. I don't know why I'm like this either.

456
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,970
 I'm scared!

457
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,200
 Tae Yong. Tae Yong.

458
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,530
 I don't want to believe it either,

459
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,560
 but he confessed.

460
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,120
 They said it's not that knife!

461
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,610
 Where could the real knife be?

462
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,560
 Chairman Kim Kang Im is being released.

463
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,650
 What?

464
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,490
 You tell me. Tell me!

465
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:36,020
 He was the whole world to me.

466
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:42,350
 You and I... weren't love by Shin Myeong Seop.
