1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,700

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,500
So you stabbed Yoon Mi Ra?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,960
Where?

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,940
How did you stab her?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,340
Stomach.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,920
I stabbed her twice in the stomach.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,490
Here.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,200
And here.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
Did you stab her with this knife?

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,430
Yes.

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,220
Are you sure?

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,170
Yes, I am sure.

15
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,960
But... the forensics told me it's not true.

16
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,730
The knife that stabbed Yoon Mi Ra

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,430
was thicker and larger.

18
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,980
How could that be?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,780
I don't know.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,590

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,160

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,120

23
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,980
We're done questioning him for now, so you can take him home.

24
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,490
But we can summon him again, so keep that in mind.

25
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,390
Yes. I understand.

26
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,790
Let's go.

27
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,280
You must have been so scared.

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,070
I'm fine.

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,040
I'm tired.

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,730
I'll go upstairs and rest.

31
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,980
Tae Yong...

32
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,300
Let's just let him sleep comfortably tonight.

33
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,850
Tae Yong.

34
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,190
Don't worry about anything and sleep well, okay?

35
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,210

36
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,280
Looks like you stayed up all night.

37
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't worry too much.

38
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,770
Our Tae Yong will be fine.

39
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,560
What do you mean?

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,010
Tae Yong is a minor.

41
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,930
He won't end up in jail or anything like that.

42
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,080
And he won't have any criminal records either.

43
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,090
He'll probably be sent to the juvenile department of the Family Court, though.

44
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,650
And then he'll end up just receiving a community service sentence or something,

45
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,820
having to do some kind of volunteer work.

46
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,040
How can you say that right now?!

47
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,530
Is that something a father should be saying?!

48
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,990
Do you really believe that he stabbed Yoon Mi Ra?

49
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,460
I don't want to believe it either.

50
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,260
But...

51
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,870
he confessed.

52
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,400
- Jeong Gook witnessed it, too. 
 - Our Tae Yong

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,830
would never do such a thing.

54
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,120
For now,

55
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,050
all we can do is do our best so that he receives

56
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,920
the minimum penalty as a minor.

57
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,390
They said it wasn't that knife!

58
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,810
They said that wasn't the knife that was used to stab Yoon Mi Ra.

59
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,470
So, why do you keep making the conclusion that Tae Yong is the culprit?

60
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,230
Detective Kang, take a look at this.

61
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,880
- The video of the remind wedding? 
 - Yes.

62
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,290
If you look here, Shin Tae Yong isn't in his seat.

63
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,720
It is conclusive that Shin Tae Yong was not present during the fireworks show

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,390
when the incident occurred.

65
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,540
Should we get an arrest warrant for Shin Tae Yong?

66
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,620
He confessed and there's a witness, too.

67
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,920
The motive for the crime is clear, and the statement of the crime is accurate.

68
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,880
We just verified that he wasn't in the garden during the time of the crime.

69
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,860
There's no way to get out of this one.

70
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,700
We haven't found the crime weapon, though.

71
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,240
Find the real weapon first.

72
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,220
Yes?

73
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,660
Pardon?

74
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,580
I understand.

75
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,580
- Where are you going? 
 - To the hospital!

76
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,460
Tae Yong.

77
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,870
Let's...

78
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,760
talk, shall we?

79
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,770
When you...

80
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,740
said you stabbed Yoon Mi Ra,

81
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,250
I don't believe it.

82
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,640
I didn't think I would do such a thing either.

83
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,100
It happened without me realizing it.

84
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
No.

85
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,570
I know my own son.

86
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,920
You would never be able to do such a thing.

87
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,570
Tell me...

88
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,030
the truth, please.

89
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,370
Why you're lying.

90
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,020
Everything I said at the police station is true.

91
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
I did it, Mom.

92
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,000

93
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,570
- Hello? 
  - This is Detective Kang Dae Wook of Gangju Police Station.

94
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,810
Yoon Mi Ra is awake.

95
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
 She isn't conscious yet,

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,630
but still, it looks like she'll survive.

97
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,240
I understand.

98
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,360
Chairman, sir?

99
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,860
Brother-in-Law!

100
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
Huh?

101
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,140
How is Tae Yong doing?

102
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,700
He's holed up in his room.

103
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,240

104
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,210
Yes, this is he.

105
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,040
Yoon Mi Ra is... awake?

106
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,410
Tae Yong. Tae Yong, what's the matter?

107
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,020
What is it, Tae Yong?

108
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,970
It's okay.

109
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,750
It's okay, Tae Yong.

110
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,760
It's okay.

111
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,820
Tae Yong definitely didn't do it.

112
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,200
 We'll be late, let's go.

113
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,830
 The handkerchief is gone.

114
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,430
 You're right. It must have fallen out somewhere.

115
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,490
 The forensics say the knife that stabbed Yoon Mi Ra

116
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,550
 was thicker and larger.

117
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,290
 I will never leave you alone.

118
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,820
 You and Shin Myeong Seop both.

119
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,850
 If you lay a finger on Han Seon Joo again,

120
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,360
 I will kill you.

121
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,700
 Stay quiet.

122
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,910
 Quiet.

123
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,070
 If you do something foolish, I will really kill you.

124
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,770
How could you...

125
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,120
really stay laying here like this?

126
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,110
For my sake...

127
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,570
please leave.

128
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,670
Where are you going?

129
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,010
Tae Hee.

130
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,020
Did you have dinner?

131
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,660
Yoon Mi Ra!

132
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,360
 For my sake...

133
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,720
 please leave.

134
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,070
 Why are you here?

135
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:32,160
 You should be in the States. Why are you here right now?

136
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,050
  I never left.

137
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,780
 What?

138
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,930
 I didn't go to the States.

139
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,150
 I don't intend to go anywhere without you.

140
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,000
 Wherever you are is where I belong.

141
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,340
 Yoon Mi Ra...

142
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,270
 I'm going to hand it over to Han Seon Joo.

143
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,110
 Hand over what?

144
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,270
 The original copy of the LaReine Gallery VVIP transaction records.

145
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,190
 The transaction records.

146
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,220
 I'm going to give it to Han Seon Joo.

147
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,380
  Are you crazy?

148
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,750
 She said she'd announce her divorce publicly if I hand it over to her.

149
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,900
 Right now in front of all the guests.

150
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,950
 You...met with Han Seon Joo?

151
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,990
 She invited me to the party herself.

152
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,020
 What did you say?

153
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,220
 Let's just end it here. It's tiring for you, too.

154
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,920
 Give up on LaReine and start over with me.

155
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,370
 If we work together, we can overtake LaReine in no time.

156
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:17,120
 I'm going to go out right now and give it to Han Seon Joo.

157
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
 Are you crazy?

158
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,890
 Yeah, I am.

159
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,110
 I told you to trust me, didn't I?

160
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,830
 Trust?

161
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,990
 You?

162
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:47,840
 You want me to trust you when you were throwing me away to the States, just so you could throw a party like this?!

163
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,690
 Don't stop me.

164
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,710
Is this what you resort to?

165
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,460
Like my sister,

166
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,990
are you planning on ending everything by dying like this?

167
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,040
If I were you, I would feel so wronged that I wouldn't be able to die. No!

168
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,780
I would not die!

169
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,690
 Yoon Mi Ra has regained consciousness.

170
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,240
 She looked for you as soon as she woke up.

171
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,060
 Please come to the hospital now.

172
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,710
Why are you just showing up? I was scared to death.

173
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,450
But... why am I laying here like this?

174
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,180
I was supposed to be in the States...

175
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,520
And... why are those people here?

176
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,690
What exactly happened to me all that time?

177
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,550
Amnesia?

178
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,970
It's a symptom that can appear when someone experiences a severe mental shock during an incident.

179
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,160
They elect to erase parts that they don't want to remember,

180
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,020
you could see it as a kind of self-defense mechanism.

181
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:42,070
So is there a possibility that her memory will never come back?

182
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,980
It could come back or it could also stay lost.

183
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,720
I can't make any guarantees.

184
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,780
I was so surprised!

185
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,390
How could such a perfect queen have such a large imperfection?

186
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,920
How could she not recognize her own husband's woman?

187
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,470
On top of that, what about Tae Yong?

188
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,620
Oh my, how horrendous!

189
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,510
Everything's fine as long as there's alcohol.

190
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,100
So abrupt? Why are you bringing up alcohol all of a sudden?

191
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,800
Since I think there are plenty of snacks,

192
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,770
I'm saying that all that's needed is alcohol.

193
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,610
It's the list of counterfeit brokers' names. While the cheap Victoria shoes are being released from China,

194
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:50,580
if we reverse-track those people now, we might be able to catch Shin Myeong Seop's tail.

195
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,530
Shin Myeong Seop...

196
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,130
I am going to catch that bastard and end this.

197
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,310
How are you feeling?

198
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,870
I'm all right.

199
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,320
Didn't you have something to say?

200
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,700
Wait a moment, there's someone coming.

201
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:20,790
Yoon Mi Ra, you claim to have something to testify?

202
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,740
Yes.

203
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,690
I remembered.

204
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,320
That day...

205
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,420
The remind wedding day...

206
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,480
The identity of the person who stabbed me with a knife...

207
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,330
Hello?

208
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,630
Yes, I understand.

209
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,930
 What you said was true.

210
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,860
 To Shin Myeong Seop,

211
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,000
 I was nothing but a mistress.

212
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,280
 Something consumable that he used to fill his own desires.

213
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,880
 To me, he...

214
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,060
 was my whole world...

215
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,100
 He was my everything.

216
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,050
 I'm going to kill him.

217
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,290
 I'm going to kill Shin Myeong Seop with my own hands.

218
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,130
 Before you kill him, you will die at his hands.

219
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,670
 You...

220
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,930
 and I...

221
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,450
 were not loved by Shin Myeong Seop.

222
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,930
 The one who Shin Myeong Seop loves...

223
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,200
 is himself.

224
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,850
I mean, does this make any sense?

225
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,700
What's the deal with the shit we've been through up until now?

226
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,600
A self-fabricated scenario?

227
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,320
Wow, seriously...

228
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,170
With a knife...

229
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,310
she stabbed...

230
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,140
herself...

231
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:34,630
What are we going to do about this case?

232
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,800
- Let's close it. 
 - Close it?

233
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,360
As long as Han Seon Joo and Shin Myeong Seop

234
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,500
say that they won't hold Yoon Mi Ra responsible any longer,

235
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,590
this is just their personal issue of passion.

236
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,150
All we can do is close the case here.

237
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,280
Then what about Shin Tae Yong? He obstructed justice by lying.

238
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,760
He should at least get punished for that!

239
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,090
He's a minor, anyway.

240
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:09,800
For that, he'll just have to write 3 or 4 pages of an apology and that's it.

241
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,290

242
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,290
I heard from the police,

243
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,590
that the culprit who stabbed me

244
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,960
was Tae Yong.

245
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,170
I can't make your son a criminal.

246
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,730
If he's your son, he's my son too.

247
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,130
Then...

248
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,440
My memory didn't come back.

249
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,520
My mind is still murky like fog.

250
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,930
You don't remember anything?

251
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,300
Still?

252
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,600
No, nothing.

253
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,440
But I heard you had a remind wedding.

254
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,390
Were you sending me to the States to do that?

255
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,810
No, it's not like that.

256
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,070
You know how I feel.

257
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,790
Oh, it's so funny!

258
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,200
It's a total comedy!

259
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,670
What's funny?

260
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,810
You.

261
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,250
Me?

262
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,460
Your face!

263
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,070
Your serious face is so funny!

264
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,180
Tae Yong didn't do anything wrong.

265
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,520
I'm the one that said we should do that.

266
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,080
I told Tae Yong to say he did it.

267
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,310
I ordered him to say he stabbed Yoon Mi Ra.

268
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,440
You told Tae Yong...

269
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,930
to do a fake confession?

270
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:39,460
Minors under 14 are considered juveniles.

271
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,340
Since they can't go to jail or have a permanent record regardless of what crime they commit...

272
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,660
Tae Hee!

273
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,150
I wanted to do it,

274
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,940
but I'm too old.

275
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,670
So I told Tae Yong to do it.

276
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,230
I wanted to save you.

277
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,200
Even still, how could you...

278
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,000
I even asked Jeong Gook to be a witness.

279
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,980
Tae Hee.

280
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,190
I don't regret it.

281
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,790
Even if I encountered the same exact situation again,

282
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,460
I would have made the same choice.

283
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,090
I planned everything.

284
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,470
So...

285
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,230
don't say anything to Tae Yong.

286
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,790
Tae Yong.

287
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,780
What are you doing here?

288
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,400
- Tae Yong. 
 - I'm scared!

289
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,250
Why? What are you scared of?

290
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,830
Mom!

291
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,980
I saw it! I saw it!

292
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,600
What? What did you see?

293
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,540
Blood! I saw blood! Blood!

294
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,350
Tae Yong! Come to your senses! Tae Yong!

295
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,230
I saw a knife! A knife!

296
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,550
 I don't even get to see the fireworks...

297
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,080
 This isn't it?

298
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,870
 Where is it?

299
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,010
 Are you crazy?

300
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,250
 You want me to trust you when you were throwing me away to the States, just so you could throw a party like this?!

301
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,840
I'm so scared... I'm scared...

302
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,260
Tae Yong! What exactly...

303
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,680
Dad...

304
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,590
Dad stabbed Aunt Mi Ra with a knife.

305
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,220
I'm scared!!

306
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,830
Tae Yong! Tae Yong!

307
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,930
It's all right. It's all right.

308
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,760

309
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,840
This case, self-fabricated by Yoon Mi Ra, has been closed.

310
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:40,510
As for Mr. Shin Tae Yong, I should punish him lightly for confusing the investigation by giving a false confession,

311
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,090
but we decided to let it go.

312
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,070
All right.

313
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,780
Please check the evidence inventory.

314
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,460

315
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,890

316
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:10,660
It was revealed that this knife was not the weapon used for the crime.

317
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:22,020
The real knife that Yoon Mi Ra used to stab herself...

318
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,980
where exactly could it be?

319
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,960
I'm not sure.

320
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:39,140
If the person involved can't remember, there's no way to find it.

321
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,420
I'm curious, as well.

322
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,340
About where that knife could be.

323
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,280
I understand.

324
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,360
Excuse me for troubling you.

325
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,440
Sit.

326
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,620
Should you have stayed at the hospital for a bit longer?

327
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,700
No need.

328
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,830
Do you still not remember anything?

329
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:07,130
Yeah.

330
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,010
I don't remember anything. Nothing at all.

331
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:24,110
Is there anything that you want to eat? Should I make you some pasta?

332
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,560
No, I just want to rest.

333
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,670
You can leave.

334
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:45,680
Well, then. Rest up, I'll be off.

335
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,470
What's wrong?

336
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,300
I don't know.

337
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,420
The tears are just coming out.

338
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,100
I don't know why I'm like this either.

339
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:35,700

340
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,880
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im is being released.

341
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,190
What did you say?

342
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,440
I think that deciding evidence has been found to prove her innocence,

343
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,140
but I don't know what it is.

344
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,680
You came?

345
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,690
Did you give Han Seon Joo the real gallery transaction history ledger?

346
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,910
I'm asking you, did you give the real transaction history ledger to Han Seon Joo?!

347
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:19,080
I don't remember...

348
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,870
I don't remember anything... I don't know.

349
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:25,480
Tell me. Tell me!

350
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,850
I don't know!

351
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:30,600
I don't know... I said I don't know!! I told you that I don't know!!

352
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,770
Since we've been his yes men, does he think we are his underlings or something? It's so late to be calling us! He has no common sense!

353
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:33,540
That's what I'm saying.

354
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,020
I mean, how could he cheat on his wife with her close younger friend?

355
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:41,680
He really is a crazy guy that's not worth associating with.

356
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,980
Hold on. Since we're on the topic, I think we chose the wrong side.

357
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,450
I was thinking the same thing,

358
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:55,850
I'm not sure whether or not we've become the odd men out while uselessly following along with Executive Director Shin.

359
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,360
I think we should probably switch sides before it's too late.

360
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,840
You're right.

361
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,390
Even if we do so now, I think it might be wise to switch routes.

362
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:29,190
I apologize for asking you guys to come so late at night.

363
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,320
It's fine, it's still early in the evening.

364
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:38,800
I was just thinking about having a glass to drink, things turned out all right.

365
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:44,200
But... what is it that you wanted to discuss so urgently?

366
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,030
What I intended to do last time,

367
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,160
I will have to do it.

368
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,420
I understand what you are saying, but I think that might be a bit difficult.

369
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,190
He's correct.

370
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,610
We are at a disadvantage in the current state of shares.

371
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:16,740
I understand that you are feeling the urgency, but acting impatiently could lead you into more trouble.

372
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,990
I agree with what Executive Lee is saying.

373
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,190
You should be backing down at this time.

374
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,360
I... will definitely rise

375
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,740
to the LaReine Group Chairman position.

376
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:26,210
Yoon Mi Ra, let's end this now.

377
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,690
You and I,

378
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,900
let's end Shin Myeong Seop.

379
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,410

380
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:50,000
♫  I leave my heart somewhere  ♫

381
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:57,030
♫  For you to see, I’m no company  ♫

382
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:04,580
♫  This is love for most bodies  ♫

383
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:12,950
♫  I guess you don't know that. I guess how I feel  ♫

384
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:16,690

385
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,050
 My love, it was real.

386
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:23,200
 My love was real, too.

387
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,230
 They're not mine. They should be returned to their rightful owner.

388
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:28,600
 Now I don't need them anymore, either.

389
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,360
 They've been too dirtied.

390
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,160
 I can't do that.

391
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,940
 LaReine is mine, just wait and see what I will do.

392
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,060
 What can I do...

393
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,670
 You're out of your mind.

394
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,600
 Your Achilles heel is in my hands.

395
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,640
 I came because I have a favor to ask.

396
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,870
 The one who started all of this, should finish it.

397
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,750
 I will end Shin Myeong Seop.

398
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,300
 Mom, you worked very hard for all that time.

399
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:59,100
 I would like it if you take Tae Hee and Tae Yong and comfort them.

400
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,480
 It won't take very long.

401
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:09,000
♫  These walls can come right over me like I’m insane  ♫
