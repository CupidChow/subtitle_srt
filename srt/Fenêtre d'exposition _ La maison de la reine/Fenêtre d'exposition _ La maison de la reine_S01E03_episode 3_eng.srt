1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,500

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:13,530

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,040
Thinking back on it, there were so many things that were strange.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,740
Then those suspicious signs were...

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,940
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps! I can't believe it!

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,010
There's a saying in The Talmud that 
  (T/N: The primary source of Jewish religious law and Jewish theology; serving also as "the guide for the daily life" of Jews)

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,740
the happiest man in the world

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,450
has a wise woman for a wife.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,080
But it makes me want to say,

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,940
the happiest woman in the world

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,700
has a husband who doesn't cheat.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,440
That's the problem with people.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,410
They think extreme misery has nothing to do with them.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,840
Groundless confidence.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,210
That's where misery begins.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,890
Mr. Shin Myeong Seop.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,000
You know Ms. Yoon Mi Ra, don't you?

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,060
She was your mistress,

19
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,070
correct?

20
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,580
Yes.

21
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,530
Does your mistress, Yoon Mi Ra,

22
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,940
know your wife, Han Seon Joo?

23
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,110
Did she approach your wife

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,290
on purpose?

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,620

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,150
Do you mean that?

28
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,980
Telling me to...

29
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,650
make him mine, do you mean that?

30
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,630
I mean it.

31
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,020
If you love him to death and can't break up with him, don't hesitate and take action.

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,770
Instead of dying like a fool,

33
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,770
make him completely yours. Even by taking it, even by stealing it!

34
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,200
Become that man's wife. This is what I'm telling you.

35
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll be on your side, Mi Ra.

36
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,500
Hi, Honey. You're back?

37
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,730
Did everything get cleared up at work?

38
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,670
Good job.

39
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,390
Me?

40
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,180
I'm on my way back after visiting Yeon Joo.

41
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,410
Yeah. I keep dreaming about her more often lately.

42
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,500
No, it's okay.

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,530
Okay, see you at home.

44
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,270
Okay.

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,410
Do you love your husband a lot?

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,680
Pardon?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Why?

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,560
You look more radiant when you're speaking to him on the phone.

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,140
Really?

50
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,390
Well, it's true. I do love my husband a lot.

51
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,980
The double contract issue with Milano was merely a superficial excuse.

52
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,070
What you're saying is you failed.

53
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,460
Not only us but all companies that have Korean brands are being rejected.

54
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,840
So you're asking me to give up on entering the Shanghai department store?

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
Well, at the moment,

56
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,690
I don't see another option.

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,670
"Don't see another option. I'm sorry..."

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,890
- Son-in-Law Shin. 
 - Yes?

59
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,660
Do you think I made you the executive director to hear those kinds of things?

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,500
The road that led you to your position doesn't only go upward.

61
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,560
It also goes down.

62
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't need any other answers.

63
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,480
Bring me the answer I want to hear.

64
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,090
Yes, Ma'am.

65
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,000
Find someone who is good at keeping quiet among his workers.

66
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,910
Yes, Ma'am.

67
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,830

68
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,850
I'm grateful for your advice.

69
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,420
Go on in.

70
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,900

71
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,510
Oh, I was about to

72
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,280
call you just now.

73
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,960
I feel bad I couldn't treat you properly on your birthday.

74
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,220
When will you be back?

75
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,940
I have some work left to finish.

76
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,050
I'll be there as soon as I'm done.

77
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,420
But... is something wrong?

78
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,540
You sound down.

79
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,650
Huh? No.

80
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm fine.

81
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll see you later.

82
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,710
Secretary Kang, it's me.

83
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,890
Did something happen at the company today?

84
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,040
Madam, let me do that.

85
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,420
Tae Hee's dad likes my spicy seafood stew.

86
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,540
I know.

87
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,780
- Then should I help you set the table? 
 - I'm fine, so go do whatever you need, Miss Kim.

88
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,920
Okay, then.

89
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,020
 A Shanghai department store canceled our brand from entering.

90
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,710
 So he got severely criticized by the chairwoman.

91
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,140
 When in fact, it wasn't even his fault.

92
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,150
 To be honest, I still can't sleep well

93
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,880
 without sleeping pills these days.

94
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,350
 Whenever I close my eyes, the day I lost my sister

95
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,770
 keeps replaying in my head

96
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,250
 like a broken video tape.

97
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,100
 What you said about how you'll die without him...

98
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,060
  my sister said the same thing to me.

99
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,160
 But I told her then.

100
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,350
 To die.

101
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,020
 To just die instead.

102
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,210
 My sister died that very day.

103
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,930
 I shouldn't have said that to her.

104
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,410
 Even if everyone in the world criticized her,

105
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,050
 I should have taken her side.

106
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,310
 If I had, she might not have made such an awful decision.

107
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,290
 Deep regret keeps flooding in.

108
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,720
 Like a wave.

109
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,000
 Each and every day, it floods in...

110
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,290
You're home.

111
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
Happy birthday.

112
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,620
Thank you.

113
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,750
But... spicy seafood stew?

114
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
It's your birthday, though.

115
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,950
It makes me happier to see you enjoy the food I make.

116
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,010
I'll go wash up first.

117
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,350
Come down after washing up and getting changed.

118
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,250
 What am I to you?

119
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,990
 Am I where you get rest when you get tired?

120
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,260
 Like a gas station maybe?

121
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,070
 Don't doubt my love for you.

122
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,780
 As you know, what I want, the dream I want to achieve

123
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,030
 is inside the family.

124
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,040
 So, I can't leave my family yet.

125
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,250
 You said you wouldn't complain even if you lived in the shadows all your life.

126
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:01,400
 You said you'd just stay by my side. I'm the same. All I need is you.

127
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,340
 I've never thought of you lightly. You know that.

128
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,610
 That you're my love.

129
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,570
 I know.

130
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,820
 I believe your love for me.

131
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,210
 Thank you, My Mi Ra...

132
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,780
 But...

133
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,530
 what will you do if I tell the world about us suddenly?

134
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,780
 Then...

135
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,180
 we'll all die together.

136
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,480
 If you love him to death and can't break up with him, don't hesitate and take action.

137
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,910
 Instead of dying like a fool, make him completely yours.

138
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,700
 Even if you have to steal or snatch him away.

139
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,230
♪  To our mom whom we love,  ♪

140
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,400
♪  happy birthday to you!  ♪

141
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,510
Happy birthday!

142
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,110
Thank you.

143
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,790
Mom, happy birthday!

144
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,330
We picked it out together.

145
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,710
What could this be?

146
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,190
- Wow. 
 - It's pretty big!

147
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,680
A "Castle of Rock" chess set!

148
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,390
We saved up our allowances for months to buy it.

149
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,130
I wanted this for so long.

150
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,560
How did you know?

151
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,260
See that? I told you she would like it.

152
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,620
Oh, thank you, Son.

153
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Thank you, Daughter.

154
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,410
But... don't you have a present for Mom?

155
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,410
Sorry. Because of work,

156
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,470
there wasn't any time to get one...

157
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,460
was what you thought I would say!

158
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,140
Ta-da! Happy birthday.

159
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,190
You're so silly.

160
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,550
Wow.

161
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,780
It's so pretty!

162
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,610
It will look so good on you!

163
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,740
It's the best piece among the Victoria collection that's being released.

164
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,740
As soon as I saw it, I thought of you and put it aside.

165
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,290
Thank you, Honey.

166
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,990
- Oh. 
 - Let me.

167
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,190
It looks great on you, Mom.

168
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,670
Really?

169
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,720
It's so pretty.

170
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,010
- Wow, it looks good. 
 - Thank you, Honey.

171
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,810
I love you.

172
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,970
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

173
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,470
Okay, let's eat.

174
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,960
It's mom's birthday. We're having the spicy seafood stew dad likes again?

175
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,480
Hey, Shin Tae Yong, aren't you jealous?

176
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,990
Grow up quickly and get a wife like your mom, too.

177
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,220
All right, all right.

178
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,680
Eat before it gets cold. Both of you, too.

179
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,420
We'll enjoy it!

180
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,850
Thank you!

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,030
You have a lot of work left to do?

182
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,060
Yes, a bit.

183
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,700
If you're tired, should I let the tango club know we can't come tomorrow?

184
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,460
Oh, it's okay. I can go.

185
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,230
What?

186
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,050
Sorry, I'll do it in the study.

187
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,350
What are you doing here without letting me know?

188
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,090
I'll be downstairs.

189
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,100
We should be resting on weekends. What's with a dance class? Doesn't even suit us.

190
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,140
What's wrong with it?

191
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,540
And I hear that tango is especially good for women.

192
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,840
How is it good for women?

193
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,750
Well, when the husband and wife dance together,

194
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,840
they're saying it makes them become closer.

195
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,310
I don't see Executive Director Shin.

196
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,470
Something urgent came up, so I came alone today, unfortunately.

197
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,560
I keep gaining around my middle these days!

198
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,450
My skin is so dull these days, too! It's so annoying.

199
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,190
What is that?

200
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,400
I knew it. You can't get beautiful without making an effort!

201
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,660
¡Hola! Hello!

202
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,060
Be careful. Be careful.

203
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,180
Everyone, surprise!

204
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,780
Introducing our newest member!

205
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,610
Everyone!

206
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,400
Master, when you bring in a new member,

207
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,440
you're supposed to discuss it with us ahead of time.

208
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,900
Oh, no! El tango es amor. (Spanish: Tango is love.)

209
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,110
Tango is love. An art that's open to everyone.

210
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,860
Anyone who doesn't want me here, put your hands up.

211
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,860
Okay, no one is opposed and everyone consents!

212
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,400
But she doesn't have a partner.

213
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,490
Her partner is here!

214
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Oh, sorry I'm late.

215
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,710
I thought you were busy.

216
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,540
I didn't want you to be lonely dancing by yourself, so I pushed everything back and ran over.

217
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,610
Tango is a dance of love.

218
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,820
First, we'll do the Cabaceo.  Make eye contact with your partner.

219
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,150
Look into each other eyes. And if you have eye contact, look longingly into their eyes.

220
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,960
The men will walk over to the women.

221
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,190
Caminada.  (Spanish: Let's walk.)

222
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,940
Let's take a walk. Walking...

223
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,800
Salida. (Spanish: Let's start.) Yes, that's it.

224
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,180
 Did you see the prosecutor's wife's bag? How can she be carrying something so cheap?!

225
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,650
 It embarrassed me even!

226
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,730
 Honey, it was my mistake. Please forgive me.

227
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,220
 What is? What was your mistake?

228
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,890
 - That's... 
 - Didn't I tell you?

229
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,850
 Not to say anything if you don't know? No,

230
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,870
 to watch this mouth of yours.

231
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,110
 I'm sorry. I did wrong.

232
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,550
 Salida!  Yes, that's it.

233
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,820
Be gentle!

234
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,830
 Honey! What's this?

235
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,460
 Did you have me followed?

236
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,060
 So who is that bastard?

237
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,520
 Who? Who? Oh, Manager Park?

238
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,490
 What is your relationship to that punk?

239
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,100
 What do you think it is? A relationship between the club manager and a member!

240
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,060
 Why is he smiling at you then?

241
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,940
 Is that illness back?

242
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,640
 What is the reason a club manager is smiling at you?! Tell him not to smile at you!

243
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,490
 Oh my god!

244
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,860
Mom. Eating together every weekend...

245
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,420
how about doing it monthly instead? Tae Hee has to prepare for the college entrance exam and go to the academy on weekends,

246
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,010
and my husband needs to get some rest, too.

247
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,200
Executive Director Shin, is it hard to come over to my house?

248
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,450
No, Ma'am.

249
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,410
What's so difficult about eating together as a family once a week?

250
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,090
Jeong Won is coming back to Korea next month. Let's eat together.

251
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,330
You know he and I can't sit across the table eating and make jokes.

252
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,030
Mom.

253
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,050
Tae Yong and Tae Hee, is the studying going well?

254
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,990
Yes. Grandma, I came in first in my class at the mid-terms.

255
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,430
Really? Great job.

256
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,460
By the way, how is the Shanghai department store entrance deal going?

257
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,540
Director Kwak is going to hold a meeting next week.

258
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,690
Why would you leave it to someone else? Important matters should be handled by you directly.

259
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,640
Well... Director Kwak has been in charge of it and has substantial knowledge of the matter.

260
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,630
I'll do the meeting myself then.

261
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,710
- Miss Oh. 
 - Yes.

262
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,980
The weather is nice, so we're having dessert outside.

263
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,630
Yes, Ma'am.

264
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,790
I told them to set the table out in the garden. Why are you bringing it in?

265
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,860
We're going home.

266
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,320
What are you unhappy about now?

267
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,020
Mom, he's someone I love and he's the children's dad.

268
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,600
Did I say anything different?

269
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,530
You're so suffocating! That's why Dad left, and even Yeon Joo...

270
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,140
You still place all the blame on me.

271
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,890
- I'll get going. 
 - Well,

272
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,690
you know what?

273
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,060
We may seem different but in the end,

274
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,070
we're the same.

275
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:15,680
No. I'll never live like you. Never.

276
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,910
Hi, Seon Joo!

277
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,770
How is your husband these days?

278
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,450
What do you mean?

279
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,330
Well, I was just curious, wondering if everything's okay.

280
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,530
Like what?

281
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,320
Never mind if it is. Nothing!

282
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,210
Bye!

283
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,360
So what happened to the bag?

284
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,000
I think I have to go throw it away.

285
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
They look really close.

286
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,700
She keeps hanging out with her instead of us these days.

287
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,420
They look like sisters.

288
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,970
Seon Joo is cold to us but so warm to that woman.

289
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,210
I know. She doesn't even know that Han Seon Joo is the queen.

290
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,800
She's treating her too comfortably.

291
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,210
She'll regret it one of these days.

292
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,170
Let's go.

293
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,060
It's so nice out.

294
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,460
But, Seon Joo,

295
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,590
how do you not have one wrinkle on your neck?

296
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,330
What's that?

297
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,880
A balm I use.

298
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,330
Well, given our age, we have to be diligent and take care of ourselves and use what we need.

299
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,590
Try it.

300
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,400
Really?

301
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,450
Oh, it's so moisturizing! Wow.

302
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,570
Mi Ra.

303
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,570
Thank you.

304
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,990
That bracelet...

305
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,050
looks like it belongs to the same series as your necklace.

306
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,660
Oh, that's true. It looks like a set!

307
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,440
Can I ask where you bought that bracelet?

308
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,090
Pardon?

309
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:37,290
To be honest, this necklace is made by my husband's company.

310
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,050
It's brand new and hasn't been released yet.

311
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,480
So?

312
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,290
Your bracelet and my necklace look like a set,

313
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,670
so I wondered if the design was leaked.

314
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,470
Oh no! The design was leaked?

315
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,630
Then what should I do?

316
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Where did you buy that bracelet?

317
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,400
 It's a bracelet!

318
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,420
 It's pretty.

319
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,300
 What's this? It's not my birthday or Christmas.

320
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,010
 Everyday is your birthday and Christmas.

321
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,060
 By chance,

322
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,370
 did you buy this out of guilt because you bought one for your wife?

323
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,800
 Today's her birthday.

324
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,210
 I got one for you, too.

325
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,200
 As expected, you're amazing.

326
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,490
I bought it at the flea market in front of Hongdae.

327
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,620
Flea market?

328
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,200
What happens if the company's design was really leaked?

329
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,280
Not sure. I'll have to look into it.

330
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,190
I'll give it to you.

331
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,850
What?

332
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,740
It'll be easier to look into it if you have the leaked item on hand.

333
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,680
Take it with you and look into it carefully.

334
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,980
Can I do that?

335
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,390
Of course.

336
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,730
Thank you.

337
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,270
In return, I'll buy lunch.

338
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,120
They're known for grilled short rib patties. Try some.

339
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,610
It's really good.

340
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,110
That bracelet isn't worth much, but you're buying me such an expensive lunch.

341
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,210
Do you not like meat by chance?

342
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,000
No, I do like meat.

343
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,670
To be honest, my boyfriend doesn't really like meat.

344
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,630
So I do eat a lot of meat on my own.

345
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,370
Really? My husband doesn't like meat either.

346
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,500
It's tasty.

347
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,070
Maybe I should buy some to take home.

348
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,730
Do they sell mustard leaf kimchi here?

349
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,710
Do you like it? I'm really good at making it.

350
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,490
You make it yourself?

351
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,410
My husband likes it.

352
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,160
I tend to make all the food my husband eats.

353
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:45,790
So your husband likes mustard leaf kimchi...

354
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,510
Goodbye, Seon Joo.

355
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,860
- See you again. 
 - Okay.

356
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,430
 Mi Ra!

357
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,020
- I'll see you again. 
 - Okay.

358
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,060
How did you know I was here?

359
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,340
Just because you cut off contact, did you think I couldn't find you?

360
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,390
It's very inconsiderate to cut off all contact, Mi Ra.

361
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,380
Tell me why you're here.

362
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,720
Don't be in such a hurry.

363
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,520
I want to work with LaReine again.

364
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,220
It would be nice if you could put in a good word to Executive Director Shin for me.

365
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,690
What did you say?

366
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,840
Of your father's soul, are you going to let the perpetual leather industry go down the shithole?

367
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,950
Make an effort so that LaReine will use us as subcontractors.

368
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,230
A family should help each other out when they're having a hard time.

369
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,230
Family?

370
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,580
Of course, we're family. We're not strangers.

371
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,960
I can't do you a favor, so leave.

372
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,090
Do I look like I'm asking for a favor?

373
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,020
What did you say?

374
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:27,850
If it's too difficult for you to ask him, too bad. I'll have to meet with him myself.

375
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,900
This evil fate, I'm so sick of it.

376
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,000
You're sick of it because you think of it as an evil fate.

377
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,930
You have to try and make it a good relationship by being kind.

378
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,590
You'll only stop this if I die, right?

379
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,160
Fine then. I'll die for you.

380
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,340
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?!

381
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,730
Hey!

382
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,150
Seriously, that lunatic.

383
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,360
Watch it!

384
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,430
Unni.

385
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,400
Who are you?

386
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm her sister.

387
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,330
Who the hell are you?

388
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,810
This lady is spewing nonsense.

389
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,090
This wench has no one left in the world but me.

390
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,020
Go. Get lost right now!

391
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,160
Evil wench.

392
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,990
I'll go for now, but we'll see each other again.

393
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,210
Hello, President Son.

394
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,470
I'm calling because of the new jewelry design that's being released,

395
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:09,160
it was kept under wraps until production. ight?

396
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,430
Of course, I do trust your team's security protocol.

397
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,120
But... I wanted to check something.

398
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,100
Could you send me the catalog or the design file?

399
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,990
No. Please keep it a secret from the chairwoman and the executive director.

400
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,180
Okay. Thank you.

401
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,620
I'll be waiting.

402
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,560
Thank you.

403
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,320
 Brother. Sister-in-Law.

404
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,310
 What's happened to you?

405
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,520
 Don't worry, Mi Ra.

406
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,200
 Your uncle will become your father

407
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,600
 and your mother.

408
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,770
 Mom.

409
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,410
 Dad.

410
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,650
 Dad.

411
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,130
 Hurry up and stamp it.

412
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,290
 My parents made this factory with their blood and sweat.

413
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,930
 What right do you have to take it?

414
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:09,190
 I'm the one who managed this factory ever since they died.

415
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:14,460
 I had to act as your guardian since you were underage back then, but now that you're an adult,

416
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,030
 you need to pay me back for taking care of you, if you're human.

417
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,720
 Take care of me?

418
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,270
 When did you ever take care of me?

419
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,880
 See this?

420
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,770
 This is why people say not to take care of anyone who's not related to you.

421
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,220
 Never mind. Hurry up and stamp it.

422
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,860
 What are you doing?

423
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,230
 I don't want to. No!

424
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,770
 You can't! I don't want to!

425
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,060
 No!

426
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,890
 I don't want to!

427
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:43,590
 No...

428
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,760

429
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,070
 Mi Ra, are you okay? Let me know right away if anything's wrong.

430
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,720
Gardner International Award has been called the Nobel Prize of the medical world.

431
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,190
And Dr. Cha Young Hoon from the Department of Psychiatry at Jaeil Haesung Hospital who won the award

432
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,650
- is about to arrive. 
  - Oh, Dr. Cha Young Hoon!

433
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,450
I can see Dr. Cha right now!

434
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,580
Welcome, Dr. Cha!

435
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,060
- Congratulations. 
 - Dr. Cha, congratulations on the Gardener International Award!

436
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,410
Oh, thank you very much.

437
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,690
You're the first Korean to win the award.

438
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,470
Please give us a word.

439
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:23,620
Well, it's such a big award so I didn't expect it.

440
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,460
It's an honor, but I also feel the weight of it on my shoulders.

441
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,000
Sis!

442
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,040
Jeong Won!

443
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,220
What? Why are you looking so good?

444
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,570
You're the same, too. People will believe me if I said you were my girlfriend.

445
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,670
You've become so good at giving compliments.

446
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,030
Any difficulty while carrying out your research?

447
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,670
Oh, excuse me.

448
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,660
Han Seon Joo!

449
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,460
Oh my god!

450
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,990
I saw the news on the flight.

451
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,100
You were the one who won the Gardner International Award!

452
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,740
Congratulations. Even I feel proud.

453
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,590
Thank you. Anyway, how long has it been?

454
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,210
You left three years ago to Boston Medical University,

455
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,130
so it's been three years.

456
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,380
It's been that long already?

457
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,460
Is everything good?

458
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,150
Yes. I'm well, thanks.

459
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,420
I thought you were in Milan. Are you back for good?

460
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,790
Yes.

461
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,810
That's great. Let's meet up once in a while and get a drink together, too.

462
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,460
That would be nice. You took me out for drinks so many times when I was in school.

463
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,890
That's what you two were up to?

464
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,970
Drinking without me?

465
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,200
I suddenly feel betrayed.

466
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,410
Wow, it looks so delicious.

467
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,800
This is it. The taste I longed for.

468
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,700
Let's all get together for a meal with the family properly.

469
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,520
I would love that.

470
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,350
Oh, right.

471
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,700
Ta-da. The wine you like.

472
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,870
You're the best.

473
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:46,240
Actually, Myeong Seop asked me to bring it for you.

474
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,530
- He did? 
 - Yes, your Myeong Seop did.

475
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,290
I knew it.

476
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,770
I've seen tons of Italian men who are so good to women.

477
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,230
But I haven't seen anyone who surpasses Myeong Seop.

478
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,890
He's at a national treasure level.

479
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,910
To be honest, when you said you were going to marry him,

480
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,670
I wasn't sure.

481
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,780
I had been hoping Young Hoon would become my brother-in-law.

482
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,790
So, are you sorry about it?

483
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,530
No. You made a very wise choice.

484
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,240
Stop talking and eat already. It's going to get cold.

485
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,710
Okay. Thank you for the food.

486
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,240
But this is so delicious.

487
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,850
Come in.

488
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,530
Is it okay for you to share such a special wine with me?

489
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,930
Since it's special, I came to share it with you.

490
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,040
Because of this, I walked here instead of driving.

491
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,220
But it didn't even take ten minutes using the shortcut.

492
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,340
It's nice that we're close by.

493
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,830
I gave my kids dinner and my husband said he'll be late.

494
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,260
I have lots of time.

495
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,070
Was your boyfriend supposed to come over tonight?

496
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,660
No.

497
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,390
That's a relief.

498
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,380
It's nice to have someone I can have fun with.

499
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,850
Can I come over once in a while?

500
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,070
Of course. You're welcome any time.

501
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,000
Especially you.

502
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,170
This wine really is good.

503
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,990
My brother brought it over from Italy.

504
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,740
Have some fruit.

505
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,580
The apple's so crisp. Where did you get it?

506
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,570
I didn't. My boyfriend brought it.

507
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,630
He knows how to pick fruits since his parents have an orchard.

508
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,920
An orchard?

509
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,070
My husband, too! His family has an orchard!

510
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,210
Your boyfriend and my husband have so much in common.

511
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,820
Not liking meat, and families having orchards.

512
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,540
I know.

513
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,320
We must have been fated after all.

514
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,490
In that regard, cheers.

515
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,960
- By the way, what happened? 
 - To what?

516
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,440
The bracelet. Did you look into it?

517
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,190
Your bracelet and ours are similar,

518
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,250
but the detail is different.

519
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,060
Well, they look alike, but the clasps are completely different.

520
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,220
I worried for no reason.

521
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,080
That's a relief.

522
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,830
 It's so much nicer with the change.

523
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,400
I'll give it back to you.

524
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,350
No, it's okay. I'll give it to you as a present.

525
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,840
I'll feel bad, though.

526
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,780
It's okay.

527
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,240
I made some mustard leaf kimchi. I'll bring it by since you like it.

528
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,980
I'd love it if you do.

529
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,550
Cheers to the best brand, LaReine!

530
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,400
To the queen!

531
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,740
 Cheers!

532
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,890
Oh, go ahead.  Eat, eat.

533
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,890
It's good.

534
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,980
This one's cooked well.

535
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,390
I'll do it, Sir.

536
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,070
Oh, it's okay. Don't worry and enjoy the food, Yeon Kyeong.

537
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,310
Oh, but how did you know my name?

538
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:09,170
He even knows the names of the cleaners at the company.

539
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,220
Let's toast.

540
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,470
Okay.

541
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,370
Cheers.

542
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,710
Let's toast.

543
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,970
Don't come out. I'll leave first.

544
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,290
- Don't be late tomorrow! 
 - Get home safe!

545
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,890
Goodbye!

546
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,080
Executive Director, Sir.

547
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,720
Oh, Yeon Kyeong.

548
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,220
Could you give me a ride?

549
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,970
Honey, were you waiting up for me?

550
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,690
How can I sleep when you're not home?

551
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,440
I could have been back late.

552
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,120
I told you to go to bed first.

553
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,030
Let's go.

554
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,990
You must be tired.

555
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,510
A little.

556
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,810
I'll wash up.

557
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,450
A woman's perfume?

558
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,370
What am I thinking?

559
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:33,220
 Is this Executive Director Shin Myeong Seop's phone?

560
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,630
Yes.

561
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,520
But who is this?

562
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,870
  Oh, you must be his wife.

563
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:50,020
 I'm the mother of Yoo Yeon Kyeong, one of his employees.

564
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,890
What is this about?

565
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,980
 I felt so sorry but grateful, too.

566
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:03,020
 I think my daughter acted out of line because she's been drinking.

567
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,790
 Still, he didn't reprimand her

568
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,340
 and even brought her home safely.

569
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,400
I see.

570
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,170
 She doesn't usually misbehave,

571
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,400
 but I don't know why she was like that today.

572
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,600
 Anyway, I just wanted to apologize but also thank him.

573
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,580
Good night.

574
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,700
What's the matter?

575
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,000
Because I love you so much.

576
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,920
Suddenly?

577
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,190
I just love you at any and all moments.

578
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:59,620
I love you so much, too.

579
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,220
The young women these days are really something.

580
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,910
Why?

581
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,040
I left dinner early to come home,

582
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,260
and one of the female employees asked me for a ride saying she's going in my direction.

583
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,810
That can happen.

584
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,100
But she was totally drunk

585
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,290
and told me I was her ideal type

586
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:29,640
and spewed out nonsense asking to get another drink somewhere else.

587
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,490
So that's why your shirt smelled like a woman's perfume.

588
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,190
I was suspicious whether

589
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,600
you were cheating on me.

590
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,890
Cheating?

591
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,760
Since you're still so attractive.

592
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,610
Only in your eyes.

593
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:54,680
That's not true. All the women in our neighborhood say the same thing.

594
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:59,910
Look here, Han Seon Joo, the woman in my life is

595
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,140
only you. Only.

596
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,280
I know that.

597
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,020
I approached him blatantly, but he was unshaken.

598
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,740
Good job. You may leave.

599
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,500
Yes, Ma'am.

600
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,630
I'm sure there is something going on...

601
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,630
It's so good.

602
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,170
Where are you?

603
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:54,740
I'll be there in ten minutes.

604
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,620
I don't have any more beer.

605
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,500
Can you bring me some beer on the way?

606
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,220
Okay.

607
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,650
 The call cannot be connected. You'll be directed to...

608
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,290
 I was going to come by with the mustard leaf kimchi. I'm stopping by.

609
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,550
Mustard leaf kimchi.

610
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,380
You came just to bring me this?

611
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:35,280
You have to eat it when it tastes the best. It's perfectly ripe now. You can eat it right away.

612
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,560
Thank you.

613
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,540
I'll be going then.

614
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,940

615
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,910
♫  Hello... Hello, anybody there?  ♫

616
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:04,460
♫  If there is, knock. Hello  ♫

617
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,860
♫  If you are still there  ♫

618
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:15,330

619
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:21,010
♫  If there is anything left to tell, to me  ♫

620
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,420
♫  Anything is fine  ♫

621
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,510
♫  The bright lights of this city  ♫

622
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:33,930
♫  My footsteps have been erased  ♫

623
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,260
♫  Hearing your presence  ♫

624

628
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,840
 Where are you right now?

629
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,250
 Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

630
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:02,390
 I think my depression has come back. You know how I get like this once in a while.

631
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,850
 If it's too difficult to bear, go to a doctor.

632
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:08,740
 You have two choices. Don't try to find out anything

633
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,540
 and trust your husband until the end,

634
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:16,140
 or see things through by digging up and uncovering everything completely.

635
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,290
 Are you hiding anything from me?

636
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,990
 There is a secret I'm hiding from you.

637
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,330
 I love another woman's man.

638
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,030
 I'll come in for a second.

639
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,680
 What's his name?

640
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,360
 What is... his name?

641
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,790
 Your man.

642
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:43,500
♫  Ignored in the city's splendid lights and natural ignorance  ♫

643
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,900
♫  Tell me you exist  ♫

644
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,850
♫  I need to know all your pain  ♫
