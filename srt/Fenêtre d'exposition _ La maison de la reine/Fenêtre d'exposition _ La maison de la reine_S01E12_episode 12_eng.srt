1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,850

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,730

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,870
It looks like you will be acquitted of the charges

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,080
of assault against Yoon Mi Ra.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
Acquitted?

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,620
A witness appeared who saw the culprit.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,560
Who is that culprit?

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,700

9
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,340

10
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,150
How could you be here? I'm sure LaReine is in a state of emergency.

11
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,110
That's why I came.

12
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,870
I'm mentally worn out, so I wanted to cool off.

13
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,790
Is the chairwoman okay?

14
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,970
Let's not talk about complicated things today.

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,670
Let's have a glass of champagne.

16
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,750
It's been a while since we had some together.

17
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,410
Yes, Secretary Kang.

18
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,820
An arrest warrant was issued?

19
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,440
Yes, Secretary Yoo.

20
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,300
 Ma'am, Chairwoman Kim was arrested.

21
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,900
I understand.

22
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,870
Congratulations, Chairman Shin Myeong Seop.

23
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,980
I'm not the chairman yet.

24
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,050
But you'll be appointed as chairman at next week's shareholders' meeting.

25
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:53,050
You have enough shares, and Chairwoman Kim Kang Im was arrested. What's the problem?

26
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,000
You... kept the original transaction history, right?

27
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,150

28
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,310
You put away the original transaction records properly, right?

29
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,170
Yes.

30
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,920
Give it to me.

31
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,820
I destroyed them.

32
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,350
What?

33
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,860
Isn't it better for you that they don't exist?

34
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,270
That's why I got rid of them right away.

35
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,450
You said you didn't want to talk about troublesome things.

36
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,590
Here. Cheers.

37
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,810

38
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,370
Who... are you?

39
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
Chief Director!

40
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,120
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course.

41
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,610
Thanks to you, I've been doing very well.

42
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,490
Well... I heard the news about Chairwoman Kim.

43
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,730
It's a misunderstanding of some kind, right?

44
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,960
Yes.

45
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,610
Factory Manager, sir,

46
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,440
No... I should be calling you "President" from now on.

47
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,080
It's become a habit.

48
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,470
You can call me whatever you feel comfortable with.

49
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,080
But what brings you here?

50
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,000
Could you make me a pair of shoes?

51
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,000
Seon Joo?

52
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,760
It is you!

53
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,060
What's going on with you? You're jogging?

54
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,740
The season's changed.

55
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,440
I've decided to change myself, too.

56
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,220
I see.

57
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,450
That's great. Now I have a running mate.

58
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,370
Shall we? Let's go!

59
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,270
Okay.

60
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,350
Dad, good morning.

61
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,790
Did you sleep well?

62
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,540
Honey, come and sit.

63
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,350
I made the seafood stew you like.

64
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,130
Wow.

65
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,300
Tae Hee! Come sit down.

66
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,780
Tae Hee!

67
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,350
You should eat before you go!

68
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,010
I went early this morning and got it at the seafood market.

69
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,560
It's so fresh.

70
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,210
The tie is too dark.

71
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,580
Let's change it to something brighter.

72
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,620
Why are you suddenly being like this?

73
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,760
I thought about it.

74
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,790
You were right.

75
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,290
I was too lacking.

76
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,540
The strike, funding issues,

77
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,000
and on top of that, Mom's gallery issues...

78
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,010
Everything happened at once, so it was really hard

79
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,450
and it was too much for me to deal with.

80
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,600
I don't think there's another way anymore.

81
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,560
I...

82
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,300
only have you to rely on.

83
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,730
So... please help me.

84
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,780
Are you... asking me for help right now?

85
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,830
Yes.

86
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,110
I am asking for help. Sincerely.

87
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,950
You're the only one who can end this crisis.

88
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,810
Help my mom get out.

89
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,120
She's not in good health, and if she collapses again...

90
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,470
Okay.

91
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,160
Please help, Honey.

92
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,900
I'll make sure you don't suffer any damages, so please don't worry.

93
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,610
My work might have been used as a tool for laundering slush funds.

94
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,650
How can you tell me not to worry? Someone like you

95
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,800
wouldn't know what art is, nor about the pride of an artist.

96
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
Remove all my work

97
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,230
from the gallery right away.

98
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,920
That's not possible.

99
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,720
Not possible?

100
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,480
Removing the work before the expiration of the contract period

101
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
is a violation of the contract.

102
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,210
There's no getting through to you.

103
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,230
Chief Director Han Seon Joo, this is artist Oh Chang Ho.

104
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,380
I apologize for worrying you.

105
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,680
There was a mistake.

106
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,520
Whatever you're thinking,

107
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,890
we've never done anything of the kind.

108
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,340
I swear, by putting my

109
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,610
honor on the line.

110
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,110
 So please trust me this once.

111
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,070
Thank you.

112
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,690
Goodbye.

113
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,300
I'll keep my work here as is.

114
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,510
I don't trust you,

115
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,880
but I trust Chief Director's words.

116
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,880
What's going on at the prosecutor's?

117
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,860
Since sensitive political issues are involved,

118
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,210
we need to be careful with what we say.

119
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,960
I'll report the progress as soon as it's updated.

120
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,030
- Oh, Team Leader Han. 
 - Yes.

121
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,210
I feel like your sister is scheming something these days.

122
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,040
Do you know anything?

123
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,730
My sister?

124
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,570
Oh, I don't know.

125
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,940
Okay. You may leave.

126
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,350
Yes, sir.

127
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,890
Chairwoman Kim Kang Im will be put on trial soon.

128
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,730
It'll be hard for her to get released so easily.

129
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,840
Not only because of Hong Kong's Silverstone issue,

130
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,340
but the public opinion against Chairwoman Kim Kang Im has deteriorated over this incident.

131
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,160
When the general shareholders' meeting is held next month, your victory is guaranteed.

132
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,520
They say it's not over until it's over.

133
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,020
Let's not ease tension until the very end.

134
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,920
Are you having fun?

135
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,230
Because everyone is following along with your manipulation,

136
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,630
it's fun, isn't it?

137
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,430
To the person who's busy trying to save you,

138
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,700
aren't you speaking too harshly?

139
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,820
Since the moment I met you, I knew.

140
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,500
That this day will come.

141
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,300
Isn't it time you stopped being

142
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,110
stubborn and prejudiced about me?

143
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,800
What I regret doing most in my life is

144
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:10,600
not stopping Seon Joo when she said she'd marry you.

145
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,110
What people are saying about me...

146
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,920
I know very well.

147
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,180
That I changed my life for the better, thanks to marrying such a great woman.

148
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,610
They call me a... Cinderella of some kind.

149
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,000
I felt wronged.

150
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,800
That my skills got brutally devalued.

151
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,860
I would have succeeded.

152
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,880
Even if it wasn't for being in your shadow or thanks to Seon Joo's halo effect,

153
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,500
I am sure I would have become the best.

154
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,260
I have the capabilities.

155
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,350
By chance, the reason I was never good enough for you...

156
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,270
was it because you feared me?

157
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,440
Sham, trickery, lies, corruption, schemes...

158
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,360
are those what you call "capabilities"?

159
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Fear you?

160
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,170
Fear is...

161
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,000
something you feel only against a worthy opponent.

162
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,690
Shin Myeong Seop.

163
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,370
You'll never win against me.

164
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,030
Take a look at yourself right now.

165
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,200
What good is LaReine Apparel?

166
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,400
When you're wearing a pathetic prison garb?

167
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,020
And what good is LaReine Shoes?

168
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,490
When you're just wearing a pair of worthless sneakers?

169
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,940
Just bear with it a little longer.

170
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,650
I, Shin Myeong Seop, who you don't find trustworthy,

171
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,370
will make sure to get you out of here.

172
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,900
Han Seon Joo never gets a break.

173
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,680
I can't believe the chairwoman was arrested.

174
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,990
Seon Joo will get through it.

175
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,790
She's strong.

176
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,280
True.

177
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,440
My husband is staying up every night because of work.

178
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,600
Because of all the company work,

179
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,590
our family is going to fall apart.

180
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,620
He stays up every night?

181
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,320
It makes sense that it's an emergency for my husband since he's a lawyer,

182
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,540
but I heard yours leaves work early.

183
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,760
Then, are you saying that

184
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,950
my husband is doing something else using work as an excuse?!

185
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,900
That's not what I said. Why are you shouting?

186
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,530
I met with Mother-in-Law before coming here.

187
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,470
How is she doing?

188
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,950
Her health is all right, right?

189
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,090
She's still upright.

190
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,830
That's a relief.

191
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,600
Did she say anything else?

192
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,640
What? Is something wrong?

193
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,750
Seriously, why are you being like this?

194
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,140
Like what?

195
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,780
Why is the Han Seon Joo that was in a fuss over not being able to conquer me,

196
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,520
becoming so submissive to me?

197
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,000
What exactly are you scheming?

198
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,240
After coming back home, I came to realize

199
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,610
that my place is right here, in the home. Like you said.

200
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,560
And...

201
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,130
I thought it over,

202
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:32,350
what you suggested about us coexisting peacefully and happily...

203
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,040
seems better than losing you and my family.

204
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,770
You, I, and Yoon Mi Ra

205
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,230
trying to coexist doesn't seem so bad.

206
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,840
Whoever you meet, do whatever you want.

207
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
But...

208
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,400
be faithful as my husband and the father of my children.

209
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,480
That's all I ask.

210
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,480
Then... prove it.

211
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,410
Prove what...

212
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,870
you said isn't a lie.

213
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,580
Oh, Tae Hee!

214
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,980
What brings you here?

215
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,090
You've been quite successful.

216
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,760
You shamelessly seduced someone's man with your pretty face.

217
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,370
And became the director of LaReine Gallery.

218
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,300
Congratulations.

219
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,580
I don't like the way you congratulated me.

220
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,510
Were you not satisfied with taking my uncle?

221
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,430
Is that why you seduced my dad, too?

222
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,390
What are you talking about?

223
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,910
Why are you playing dumb?

224
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,260
That day, our eyes definitely met.

225
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,820
The day when you kissed my dad in our house.

226
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,400
You came to argue over that?

227
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,980
No, I came to warn you.

228
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,800
If you mess with my mom,

229
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,310
I won't leave you alone.

230
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,380
How cute.

231
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,030
What the hell is going on?

232
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,990
Why hasn't Han Seon Joo's stake changed?

233
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,680
That's what I'm saying! LaReine stocks were definitely handed over to Silverstone, but who those stocks belonged to... that's...

234
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,450
If they weren't Chief Director Han's stocks, even if we buy all of them,

235
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,140
won't we be too weak in the fight for stake?

236
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,640
According to our calculations, yes.

237
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:04,240
Is it possible that one of the directors on our side betrayed us?

238
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,260
Could they be your stocks, Brother-in-Law?

239
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,720
Excuse me?

240
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,640
It's not me.

241
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,840
You are home? I've finished preparing for dinner.

242
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:46,080
Hold on... The stocks given to Silverstone as collateral,

243
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,300
they weren't yours?

244
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,760
 There's a hedge fund company called Silverstone.

245
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,190
 Hedge fund?

246
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,870
 Using the company stakes in my possession, take out a secured loan.

247
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,360
 Excuse me?

248
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,690
 In any case, I received those stocks

249
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,220
 from the chairwoman.

250
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,100
 Thanks to her, I lived quite well all that time,

251
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,660
 so now I should return them.

252
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,790
 Thank you very much, Director Choi.

253
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,130
 You helping me allow my fool of a son

254
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,350
 to receive treatment at the best hospital in the world,

255
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,960
 is enough for me.

256
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,540
Did I not tell you?

257
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,430
Those were Director Choi's stocks.

258
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:58,860
Director Choi's stocks?

259
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,950
When he recommended Silverstone to me,

260
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,590
he said that he would use his own stocks for collateral.

261
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,220
It must have been a difficult decision. I'm so thankful.

262
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:18,030
I was so worried, but it's a relief nevertheless.

263
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,920
Since it helped to normalize LaReine.

264
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,120
Wash your hands and come over.

265
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,260
Are you going to cancel the stockholders' meeting?

266
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,380
Let's conduct it as planned.

267
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,470
What?

268
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,540
Just remove the item of the chairman election,

269
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,540
and conduct it as planned.

270
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,380
Yes, sir.

271
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,840
Are you... giving up?

272
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,290
No. I'm just putting it off for a little while.

273
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,060
Yes, I understand.

274
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,170
This is a rip-off of the Victoria design.

275
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,840
An employee of ours uncovered them being displayed in a general store stall in Dongdaemun.

276
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,290
What should we do?

277
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,500
Shall we report it to the police?

278
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,040
No.

279
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,850
It won't be too late to report after preparing countermeasures.

280
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,450
First, go collect all of the fake products displayed in Dongdaemun with a task force.

281
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,180
And gather the legal team to discuss the illegal use of a brand and the issue of the Trademark Law.

282
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,100
Yes, sir.

283
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,620
 Please make a shoe.

284
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,460
 Isn't this the Victoria?

285
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,580
 Yes, you are correct.

286
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,240
 Why these?

287
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,940
 I will sell this design to you.

288
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,420
 Just give me 10 thousand won. (~10 USD)

289
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,900
 You're saying that you are selling the Victoria design for 10 thousand won?

290
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,480
 Yes.

291
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,940
 So, the shoes that you make will never be illegal.

292
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,690
 You bought the design fairly by giving money to LaReine,

293
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,180
 and it is your company's shoe.

294
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,440
 May I ask the reason?

295
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,690
 The Victoria was a mistake from the beginning of their creation.

296
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,020
 In return, I have a condition.

297
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,410
 Inside of this are lists of the names of Chinese clients.

298
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:45,360
 Please spread the shoes you make to these clients alone.

299
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,220
 As fast as possible, as much as possible.

300
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,590
 As if imitations are being circulated.

301
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,450
 Yes, I understand.

302
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,740
One billion won in cash?

303
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:31,100
In the ledger that was seized from the gallery, the cost of the painting that we bought from Assemblyman Cheon was 3.8 billion won,

304
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,120
but only 2.8 billion won was recorded.

305
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,180
That means that the remaining one billion won was in cash.

306
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,850
It's Yoon Mi Ra's doing.

307
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,990
Yoon Mi Ra manipulated the account book.

308
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,300
I definitely remember the Matisse painting we bought from Assemblyman Cheon. We bought it for 2.8 billion, but...

309
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,680
why does it say 3.8 billion in the ledger?

310
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,490
Because somebody manipulated it.

311
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,890
But it's only a matter of time before that would have been revealed.

312
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,640
Time.

313
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,900
This is a strategy to gain time.

314
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,950
Shin Myeong Seop must have planned to become the Chairman of LaReine, while Mom is under custody.

315
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,640
Did you tell Shin Myeong Seop?

316
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,730
Yes.

317
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:37,370
I told him that Yoon Mi Ra wanted to turn Yeongwon Leather into Yeongwon Trading Co.

318
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:46,520
Soon there will be a gap between the two of them.

319
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,390
That gap...

320
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,510
will make a big river, so they cannot approach each other.

321
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,000
- What did you find out? 
 - Dongdaemun, Namdaemun, as well as other shoe stores, they're already spread all over the country.

322
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,180
Where the hell did these shoes come from?

323
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,970
They said they were imported from China.

324
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,860
But do you remember the incident of fake Yeongwon Leather from two years ago?

325
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,240
Yeongwon Leather?

326
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,690
When I looked up the shoe's distribution development,

327
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,480
I found that the same Chinese distributors that were involved with Yeongwon Leather,

328
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,290
were distributing the Victoria in the same way as two years ago.

329
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,380
All right. You may leave.

330
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,750
Yes, sir.

331
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,900
Why did you suddenly call to meet...?

332
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I heard there are rip-offs of the Victoria all over the markets.

333
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,080
What?

334
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,550
How can that...?

335
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,310
Did you do it?

336
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,920
Me?

337
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,490
No, it's not me.

338
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,430
Our Yeongwon Leather was almost destroyed after the case from two years ago.

339
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,700
Am I crazy to do the same thing again?

340
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,450
The distributors of Victoria in China

341
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,360
were connected to Yeongwon Leather two years ago...

342
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,980
I am going crazy now..

343
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,110
It's not me.

344
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,070
Please believe me.

345
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,940
I don't have the files related to those dealings because Mi Ra took them all last time.

346
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,090
I had already told you that all the information on my computer was deleted.

347
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,580
This...

348
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,960
These were found in Dongdaemun.

349
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,750
They were imported from China.

350
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,010
Are you saying my shoes are fake?

351
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,770
I think so.

352
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,530
Why are you laughing? Aren't you mad?

353
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,060
If it's being plagiarized then it must be popular.

354
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,030
Why would they be making a rip-off of a luxury brand?

355
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,770
Because they really want it.

356
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,590
Because it's popular and people liked it, they make rip-offs.

357
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:02,620
They cannot buy expensive luxury items, so their mentality is to buy a rip-off.

358
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,190
That's unexpected. I thought you'd be mad.

359
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,070
Why would I be mad? This is proof that they were recognized as luxury items.

360
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,230

361
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,500
What....

362
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,390
Hello.

363
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,330
Oh, hi.

364
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,980
Oh my... these shoes are Victoria, right?

365
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,560
Yes, that's right.

366
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,780
Victoria, my foot.

367
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,720
Isn't it an imitation you bought on roads?

368
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,910
No. These are genuine Victoria shoes.

369
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,510
Whatever.

370
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,510
Whether it is genuine or fake, its quality changes based on the wearer.

371
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,210
What's the use of wearing genuine ones...

372
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,870
when the person is fake?

373
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,950
Actually, the shoes were produced by Han Seon Joo's company,

374
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,690
they were called the Queen's shoes or whatever.

375
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,870
Nowadays, many people have those shoes.

376
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,670
It's become very common.

377
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,280
I also bought the original product. Now, every time I see the fake one, I cannot bring myself to wear it.

378
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,120
Everyone sees the genuine one as a fake item.

379
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,440
Don't you think it's proof that they are popular?

380
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,590
Popular? I don't think so.

381
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,610
I never liked it from the get-go.

382
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,190
Somehow the design looked cheap.

383
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,350
Honestly, isn't it too far away from being the Queen's shoes?

384
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,120
Am I the only one feeling this way?

385
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,390
I also bought it because it was from Seon Joo's company, but even I didn't like it from the get-go.

386
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,490
Somehow, it looks cheap.

387
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,380
Don't you think so?

388
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,520
Don't they seem cheap like from a street stall,

389
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,380
rather than a luxury store?

390
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,280
Cheap items are easy to find.

391
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,810
You're right.

392
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,150
They're nice. Just take it.

393
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,570
Victoria shoes are ten thousand won.

394
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:31,010
Victoria shoes are ten thousand won. You should get them.

395
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,660
Get those too. I'll give you both for 15,000 won.

396
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,260
Victoria are 10,000 won?

397
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,410
If you buy another, I'll throw in another pair.

398
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,410
That's a deal.

399
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,690
These shoes are not worth ten thousand won.

400
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,830
My Victoria...

401
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,310
they are not cheap items.

402
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,840
 You kept the original transaction records, right?

403
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,660
 Yes.

404
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,490
 Give them to me.

405
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,450
 I destroyed them.

406
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,870
 What?

407
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:12,750
 Isn't it better for you that they don't exist? That's why I got rid of them right away.

408
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,730
Did you know that today was the due date?

409
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,460
Of course.

410
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,770
Mi Ra.

411
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,790
Should we have a baby?

412
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,850
Are you serious?

413
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,880
Let's have a beautiful daughter that resembles you.

414
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,180
And next year, the three of us should

415
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,400
come together to see your parents.

416
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,270
Myeong Seop.

417
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,600
What will happen to Chairwoman Kim Kang Im?

418
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,200
The prosecution has taken all the evidence from the gallery,

419
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,820
so she'll be in prison soon.

420
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,610
And the original transaction records...

421
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,260
give them to me.

422
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,020
Hmm?

423
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,600
Original transaction records of the gallery, give them to me.

424
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,000
I told you I destroyed them.

425
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,420
Don't tell me you don't believe me?

426
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,440
I am telling you the truth.

427
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,360
I really did destroy them. I got rid of everything.

428
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,820
Are you leaving?

429
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,060
Was it you?

430
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,980
What?

431
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,400
Are you the one who distributed the Victoria shoes to the Chinese clients?

432
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,540
What are you saying?

433
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:39,660
You are the one that holds the file of the client list from two years ago.

434
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,850
Why would I? Why would I do such a thing?

435
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,280
Would there be another reason other than money?

436
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,660
I didn't do it.

437
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,540
I would never do that.

438
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,770
But how...?

439
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,980
How can you suspect me?

440
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,790
I am sorry. I must have become too sensitive these days.

441
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,210
Unnecessarily, I suspected you as well.

442
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,400
I apologize.

443
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,720
Okay then, forget everything and sleep well.

444
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,220
If you don't get sleep, drink some warm milk.

445
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,870
Bye.

446
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,610
You are too much.

447
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,710
Shall we have a talk?

448
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,310
I know you are going through puberty and having a tough time studying.

449
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,590
But nowadays why are you being rude to me?

450
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,470
I saw you.

451
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,710
What?

452
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,470
I said I saw you.

453
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,380
What? What did you see?

454
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,410
You and Yoon Mi Ra kissing.

455
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,250
I can never forgive you.

456
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,900
I need to study, so please leave.

457
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,400

458
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,930
Director Yoon Mi Ra.

459
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,990
It looks cool.

460
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,780
Are you able to manage?

461
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,340
Of course.

462
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,830
I am doing well.

463
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,480
I came here to tell you something.

464
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,990
Shin Myeong Seop and I...

465
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,800
are not getting divorced.

466
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,050
I changed my mind.

467
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:24,350
I will never divorce him.

468
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,350
You will not divorce him, while obviously knowing we are seeing each other?

469
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:41,320
Coming to think of it, you and Shin Myeong Seop.

470
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,630
And me. Like this, the three of us...

471
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,450
can peacefully and happily coexist.

472
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,290
What did you say?

473
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,580
Together. We live together in this world, right?

474
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,750
Do you like it?

475
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,130
Do you like being with Shin Myeong Seop as just a cover?

476
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,900
A queen pretending to be happy, with shabby remnants.

477
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,260
That is you, do you know that?

478
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,420
Yoon Mi Ra.

479
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,180
You continue to live as a mistress.

480
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:34,900
Keep living as a mistress who cannot stand honorably by Shin Myeong Seop until you die.

481
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,030
Your child will also live as an illegitimate child.

482
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,810
By being pointed at by society, forever.

483
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,760
The gallery transaction ledger.

484
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,440
I know you manipulated them.

485
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,610
Do you have proof?

486
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,950
I received this earlier.

487
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,650
It's a subpoena from the prosecution for the LaReine Gallery director.

488
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,930

489
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,750
Get ready to pay for all that you've done.

490
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:05,320
Mom, what the hell is wrong with you?

491
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,860
How can you act as if nothing ever happened?

492
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:20,150
Tae Hee, I have a plan.

493
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,350
You trust me, right?

494
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,770
I do.

495
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,140
I am on your side, no matter what decision you make.

496
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:39,590
But I am worried about Tae Yong.

497
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,850
He has a tender heart, I'm worried he'll get hurt. I'm scared he'll go astray.

498
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,740
When you get divorced, Mom...

499
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,950
I hope you keep it a secret from Tae Yong until then.

500
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,400
My daughter...

501
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,590
When did you become an adult?

502
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,660
Stay away for a bit.

503
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,690
I don't want to.

504
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,680
Listen to me.

505
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,310
Why should I? Why do I have to?

506
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:35,430
You're avoiding a typhoon for now, not confronting it.

507
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,060
If you get summoned soon, both of us could be in danger.

508
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:46,440
So, until I call you back, hide quietly.

509
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,370
Mi Ra.

510
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:02,390
I only wanted to be by your side.

511
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,560
By the time you come back, the situation here will be taken care of.

512
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,000
We are almost there now.

513
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,080
Us being happy is the only thing that remains.

514
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,870

515
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,620
 It's me.

516
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:22,170
I have the original transaction history.

517
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:25,460
What?

518
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:31,120
If I submit the original copy to the prosecution now, the chairwoman will be released. Right?

519
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,800
Where are you?

520
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,530
I will give you the data.

521
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,740
Where are you right now?

522
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,220
Divorce him.

523
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,850
Give me the data, then I will divorce him.

524
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:44,930
No. Divorce him first.

525
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,530
Yoon Mi Ra.

526
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,210
If you divorce him, I will give it to you.

527
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,140
The proof that your mother is innocent.

528
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,010
Yoon–

529
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:20,760
As you directed, we confirmed whether she went to the airport.

530
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,440

531
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,420
 The phone is turned off.

532
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:22,300
We don't have anything left to talk about.

533
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,500
There is something you have to do.

534
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,710
Just stop it.

535
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,970
Stop it?

536
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:36,260
Suddenly, everything is no longer fun.

537
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,110
Usually, I am a person who gets bored easily.

538
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:45,000
So, don't ever come to see me again.

539
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,120
Did you get caught by Han Seon Joo?

540
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,820
No.

541
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,590
I realized now.

542
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:05,920
My love and your love, were all wrong from the start.

543
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,980
So, I am going to give up now.

544
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,870
No.

545
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,290
We were not wrong.

546
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:24,130
The only thing is that the people we love have a family.

547
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,220
Can that become a reason to stop our love?

548
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,180
Can you stop loving just because you want to?

549
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,990
I have...

550
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,710
a final card.

551
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:47,570
My love and your love neither ended nor failed.

552
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:52,130
So, help me.

553
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,000
A final card?

554
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,120
Tell me what Han Seon Joo wants.

555
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,590
This place will be more comfortable and safer than a hotel.

556
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,380
I will let you know about what is happening in Seoul.

557
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,740
Also, turn off your phone. It can be tracked.

558
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:56,660
Nobody will be able to find you.

559
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,400
What do we do, Sister?

560
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,000
We have to make her reveal herself.

561
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:51,590
I will make it so that Yoon Mi Ra reveals herself.

562
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:57,460
So she cannot endure it any longer but has to reveal herself.

563
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,570
Do you have a plan?

564
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:10,520
Do you know how to catch a bear hiding in a cave?

565
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,980
You use smoke so that the bear can't stand it,

566
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,420
and comes out on its own.

567
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,060
I will make that happen.

568
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:50,180
 Yoon Mi Ra, you will end up coming to me.

569
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,020

570
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,560
 Contact me once you arrive.

571
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,980
The wedding shoes you made for me.

572
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:43,090
Even after so many years, it's the most gorgeous

573
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:45,350
and beautiful.

574
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,550
I remember the time you proposed to me.

575
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:59,590
You didn't have anything

576
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,030
back then.

577
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,770
So why did you shine so much?

578
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:17,410
Did I lose that shine now?

579
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:23,870
No.

580
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:32,300
You're still shining.

581
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:41,930
We can be happy again, right?

582
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,160
We need to try...

583
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,660
to make us all happy.

584
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,860

(T/N: Vow Renewal)

595
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,760
 Somebody stabbed Yoon Mi Ra,

596
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,120
 but it's not any of you.

597
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,330
 Thank you all for coming.

598
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,810
 I was invited by Han Seon Joo.

599
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:36,220
 I will not let you hurt Seon Joo anymore.

600
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,210
 Turn the car around!

601
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,540
 You can't stop me until I die.

602
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:44,130
 Uncle, there is blood on your hands.

603
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:47,600
 Stay quietly.

604
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,950
-  Did you bring the data?  
 -  Why is it remind wedding, instead of a divorce?

605
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,380
 Mi Ra, is as precious as you are to me.

606
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:57,790
 I will never forgive the real culprit, although I don't know who it is.

607
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:01,120
 You're saying that wasn't the knife the culprit used?

608
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,740
 Then ,what was the real knife the culprit used?
