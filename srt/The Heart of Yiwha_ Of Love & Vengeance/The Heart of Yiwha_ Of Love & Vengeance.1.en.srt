1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,760
It's coming!

2
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,240
You. Go.

3
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,720
Who is it, Dad?

4
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,320
Bandit Wad's son.

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
Where's your father?

6
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm right here.

7
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
That's all you brought?

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,320
This is more than enough
to send you to your grave.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Wad! Why did you kill him?!

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Dad!

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
Dad!

12
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
Tough bastard, aren't you?

13
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,280
If you're about to drive those nails
into my guts,

14
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,160
take a look over there.

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Mom…

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,760
If you fight,

17
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,480
I'll shoot them one by one.

18
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,080
Yod!

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,160
You bastard! Let my wife and child go!

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,360
You want me to let them go?

21
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,040
Then there has to be
an exchange, my friend.

22
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,160
What do you want from me?

23
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,520
That chest tattoo of yours.

24
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
Master of Khao Phrom
gave it to you, right?

25
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
I want it.

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
Old Master Khrua Phut
would never tattoo a thief like you.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,360
That's why I had to come
begging you myself.

28
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Dad!

29
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
- Yod!
- Dad!

30
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,600
What are you going to do?

31
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,320
What are you going to do to me?

32
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm going to skin you

33
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,000
and make a tattooed jacket out of it.

34
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,720
You're damn invulnerable.
Can't cut you. Can't stab you.

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,320
Poor Yod…

36
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,520
You'll have to endure a little pain.

37
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,240
Lasor.

38
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
Stab his anus.

39
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,000
You damned wretch! You!

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,920
Damned wretch, am I?

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,920
No!

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,360
Mom… Does it hurt?

43
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
I told you to stab him!

44
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Stab!

45
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,960
Hey!

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,240
Mom…

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,440
Stab!

48
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Dad!

49
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,440
You hellish beast! I'll kill you!

50
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,080
Let me go!

51
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,520
Yod!

52
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,440
Dad!

53
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Hey.

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
Yod.

55
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
No!

56
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,600
Let go!

57
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,080
Dad!

58
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
Let go!

59
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>At the dawn of King Chulalongkorn's reign,</i>

60
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,800
<i>Tha Khiri</i>

61
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
<i>stood as a vital frontier port of Siam.</i>

62
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
<i>Yet despite its importance,</i>
<i>the land was plagued by criminals.</i>

63
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
<i>Bandit communities flourished,</i>

64
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,640
<i>raiding both land and sea,</i>

65
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,840
<i>committing robbery</i>
<i>and murder without pause,</i>

66
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,400
<i>even in broad daylight.</i>

67
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Let's go!

68
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,800
No!

69
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,400
Where are you taking my wife?!

70
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,880
Hey!

71
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,880
Let go of me!

72
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Please don't hurt my wife and child.
I beg you.

73
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,960
Please.

74
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Khun Yod.

75
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,040
<i>Yana Buddho Molo Chang-ngang.</i>

76
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,480
<i>Anitassa Na Appatika.</i>

77
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,080
Surrender now and I'll take you alive.

78
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,440
<i>Only Khun Yod Pakdee,</i>

79
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,240

<i>Elsewhere in Tha Khiri,</i>

84
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,720
<i>had fallen into dens</i>
<i>of bandits and lawlessness.</i>

85
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,200
Are you crazy?
That knife almost pierced my neck.

86
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
Doing good

87
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,640
and being repaid with blame. Look again.

88
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
Look carefully.

89
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
A giant scorpion?

90
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Didn't you know

91
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,040
this forest is crawling with them?

92
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,040
If I hadn't helped you,

93
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,360
your face would be swollen shut by now,

94
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
<i>Blur.</i>

95
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Who are you calling dumb?

96
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,960
You, obviously. <i>Blur!</i>

97
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,760
Watch out!

98
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
What is that?

99
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Stone centipede herb.

100
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
It works wonders against scorpion poison.

101
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,560
You'll get better soon.

102
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,320
I never knew
this plant could counter scorpion poison.

103
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,160
<i>Blur.</i>

104
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Hey, are you calling me stupid?

105
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,120
There are just the two of us here.
If not you, then who?

106
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,240
I saved you. You saved me.

107
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
Let's call it even.

108
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,120
Done.

109
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,200
Are you a healer?

110
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,840
I just know a thing or two.

111
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Why? Afraid I'll rot your foot off?

112
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,400
It's just a sting, far from the heart.

113
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,520
I won't die that easily.

114
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,040
Someone like you
won't die from scorpion poison.

115
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,840
You'll die from what you say.

116
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,400
Hey, your herb really works.

117
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,280
I don't even feel any pain now. Look.

118
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,359
You're lucky it didn't sting you badly.

119
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,640
Otherwise you'd have died in this forest.

120
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,240
By the way, where do you live?
I'll walk you home.

121
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,839
It's just a scorpion sting.
I didn't get my leg chopped off.

122
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Why should I have to tell you?

123
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,800
I asked, so answer already.
Don't dodge me.

124
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,720
Even if I told you, you wouldn't find it.

125
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
Don't underestimate me.

126
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,320
Nothing in Khuan Phra-ngam
escapes my eyes.

127
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Big talk.

128
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,840
At the very least,
you've never seen my face.

129
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,120
Because you're not from this district.

130
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,560
How would I have seen you?

131
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,680
And how do you know I'm not from here?

132
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
<i>Blur!</i>

133
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,840
Wait.

134
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,760
I don't even know your name.

135
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,960
<i>Blur!</i>

136
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,760
Bandit Yai is here.
I told them to wait outside.

137
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,880
I know.

138
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,720
Think carefully, Wad.
Tycoon Thongyoo is an influential man.

139
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,280
Do you really think
robbing him will be easy?

140
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
He lives off other people's backs,
squeezing the villagers dry.

141
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,240
So he deserves to be robbed, doesn't he?

142
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
How many men did Bandit Yai bring?

143
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,440
Go prepare liquor and food.
Feed them well.

144
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
If my father's Lek Lai amulet is real,

145
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,520
this cat won't die.

146
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,880
Hey, it misfired.

147
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,840
That means Dad Wad's Lek Lai is real.

148
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,200
That's why it won't fire,
why blades can't cut through.

149
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,040
It could be a coincidence, Nui.

150
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,560
Go take the Lek Lai off its neck,
then I'll shoot again.

151
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,680
- Hey…
- If it shoots,

152
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
then that means Dad's Lek Lai is real.

153
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
Go.

154
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,960
But the cat will die.

155
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,480
Then let it die.

156
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,200
It's just a cat.
Or do you want me to shoot you instead?

157
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Okay…

158
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,560
Kitty,

159
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,120
if you survive,
I'll treat you to a big meal.

160
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,480
But if you don't, I'll make merit

161
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,280
for you.

162
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,600
Nui.

163
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,760
Move.

164
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,360
Don't!

165
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,120
Yiwha?

166
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,360
We bind ourselves in loyalty,

167
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,520
from this moment onward.

168
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,320
If any man be false or deceitful,

169
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,160
betrays us and stabs us in the back,

170
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,840
may he perish in ruins,

171
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,080
die by spear and blade,

172
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,480
his blood soaking the earth.

173
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,640
By the power of the spirits,

174
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,400
may his kin and companions

175
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,040
die violent deaths within three days,

176
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,400
not lasting three months,

177
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,200
not enduring three years,

178
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,720
and fall into Avici Hell
for endless lifetimes.

179
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,000
What is it?

180
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,920
At the forest outside of Chum Suea.

181
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,760
Go, and don't ever come back.

182
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,440
Jon, hurry up and take the cat away.

183
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,560
Yes.

184
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Yiwha.

185
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,320
When are you going to
stop interfering in my life?

186
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,640
You first. When will you
stop pulling these stupid stunts?

187
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,320
Everyone values their own life.

188
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,680
It's just one cat.
Why are you making such a big deal?

189
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,600
Lasor, don't let this become
karma that clings to you.

190
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,120
Yiwha,

191
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,880
I want to test my father's Lek Lai
to see if it's really sacred.

192
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,400
One dead cat is worth it, isn't it?

193
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,520
Lasor.

194
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,440
Dad.

195
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,360
- Dad…
- It has to hurt.

196
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,200
So you'll remember.

197
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,000
This charm exists to protect you,

198
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,000
not for you to fool around
and test it for fun. Understand?

199
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,040
I know, Dad.

200
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,520
You know, and you still did it?

201
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,640
- Huh?
- Dad, that's enough.

202
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,040
You've whipped Lasor
until his legs are nothing but welts.

203
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
After I'm done with Lasor,
I'll whip you next, Yiwha.

204
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,960
Huh? What did I do?

205
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,560
You went and learned
knife-throwing again, didn't you?

206
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,080
No…

207
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,240
I didn't learn knife-throwing. Not at all.

208
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,160
Then what is this?

209
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,240
I asked you, what is this?

210
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,240
I just practiced a little.

211
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,360
Take it off.

212
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah.

213
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
Great. Turn around.

214
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,960
I said turn around.

215
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,800
Turn around.

216
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,120
It was you, right?

217
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,880
You taught Yiwha to throw knives.

218
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
I meant to raise Yiwha
to be a proper woman,

219
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,880
and you teach her
to follow in my footsteps?

220
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,080
You want my daughter to become a bandit?

221
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,040
I didn't teach her to be a bandit.

222
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,720
I taught her how to protect herself.

223
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Nosy!

224
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,840
She's my daughter. I can protect her.

225
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,960
You can't keep spreading
your wings over your kids forever, Wad.

226
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,960
You know about that prophecy.

227
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't let some empty prophecy
decide your children's fate.

228
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,680
Dad told me to bring
this herb to treat your wounds.

229
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
Why didn't he come himself?

230
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,920
He's probably still angry.

231
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,680
I don't understand.

232
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,080
Even now,
Dad still won't let me go raiding.

233
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,640
He's never once thought

234
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,360
of teaching me sorcery or spells, either.

235
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,880
He probably doesn't want you
to be a bandit like him.

236
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,880
Look at me. Just learning knife-throwing
turned into this whole mess.

237
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,760
Just you wait, Yiwha.
Even if Dad won't teach me,

238
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,080
I'll find a way to learn.

239
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,720
I'll prove
I'm not as useless as he thinks.

240
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,400
And one day,

241
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
I'll become a great bandit, just like him.

242
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,560
These days, it's trouble every damn day.

243
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,080
I'm going to perform
a house-warding ritual

244
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,280
to drive the filth and bad omens
out of Chum Suea.

245
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,920
Go find the sorcerer.
Get an auspicious time for the ceremony.

246
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,360
Then no cursed calamities will befall us.

247
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,520
Okay.

248
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,520
I can only raise these kids physically.

249
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,680
They never listen to my words.

250
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,320
If you can't stop them,
then push them forward.

251
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,320
Let them do what they want.

252
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,640
Just keep an eye on them from a distance.

253
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,520
I'm afraid.

254
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm afraid that prophecy will come true.

255
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,360
<i>Sleep now, little ones</i>

256
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,080
<i>Sleep so sound</i>

257
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
<i>Mother bought the four guardians</i>

258
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,200
<i>To keep you safe</i>

259
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
Let me see.

260
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,280
Oh…

261
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,920
Sleeping like logs.

262
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,800
Are these twins your children?

263
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,760
Yes, Grandma.

264
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,320
The younger one has a hard fate,

265
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,520
born with the cord wrapped around her neck
and she still survived.

266
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,640
As for the older one, stubborn.

267
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,880
He wouldn't turn,

268
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,040
wouldn't come out
no matter how long you pushed.

269
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,080
He nearly killed you all.

270
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,320
It's like you saw it with your own eyes.

271
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
Grandma,

272
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,840
what about my children's destiny?
Will I be able to rely on them?

273
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,280
Kill them.

274
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,080
You filthy-mouthed hag!

275
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Get out of my house right now.

276
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,640
Niem, drag this old witch out.

277
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,560
Remember my words.

278
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,920
First, within three days,
your wife will die by a venomous creature.

279
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,720
Second, your son

280
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,280
will bring great ruin upon Chum Suea.

281
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,160
And last,

282
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,160
your daughter
will lead death to her father.

283
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,360
Kill them.

284
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
It's the only way

285
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,000
to stop the calamity.

286
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,400
You old hag.

287
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,160
If you don't stop
cursing my wife and kids, I'll shoot!

288
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,760
The current of karma

289
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,760
will arise right now.

290
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,000
- Then die!
- No.

291
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,200
Hey.

292
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,600
Huh?

293
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,000
In less than an hour,
it'll be three nights.

294
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,840
That old hag's prophecy
will never come true.

295
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,400
Dear, I'm scared.

296
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,400
You don't have to fear anything.
I'm right here.

297
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,000
I ordered the men to guard the house.

298
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,640
Not a single snake, creature,
or venomous thing can slip in.

299
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,200
Wad…

300
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,600
If I die,

301
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,200
you have to take care of our children.

302
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,800
Promise me.

303
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,640
- Don't kill our children.
- Panan.

304
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,520
Why would you say that?

305
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,920
Nothing's going to happen. Trust me.

306
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,320
Dear, promise me.

307
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,480
How could I ever kill my own children?

308
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,800
Alright.

309
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,920
Get some rest. I'll keep watch.

310
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,160
It's dead, Panan.

311
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,960
I killed it. It's dead.

312
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,520
Dear, it hurts.

313
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,000
Dear…

314
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,040
It bit you.

315
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,080
I…

316
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,160
- Dear…
- Panan.

317
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,560
What's wrong?

318
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,320
I can't breathe.

319
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,040
Panan!

320
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,239
Hey! Whoever's outside!

321
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,000
Get up here!

322
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,639
Niem, go fetch the healer. Now!

323
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,440
What's wrong with Panan, Wad?

324
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,600
Panan.

325
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,520
Panan.

326
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
Panan.

327
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,920
Panan!

328
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,400
It might've just been a coincidence.

329
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,440
I know
you can't bring yourself to kill them.

330
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,120
But if I don't…

331
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,120
that prophecy will destroy Chum Suea.

332
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,520
And what did your children do wrong--

333
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,120
Yeah, they didn't do anything wrong.
It's my fault for even thinking it.

334
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,560
Even a dog loves its pups.

335
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,480
How could I kill my own children?

336
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,480
<i>Tha Khiri is not only</i>
<i>riddled with bandits,</i>

337
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,480
<i>its officials are corrupt as well,</i>

338
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,600
<i>taking bribes, embezzling state funds,</i>

339
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,640
<i>and squeezing the villagers dry.</i>

340
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,640
<i>Thus the court appointed</i>
<i>Phraya Dechanurak, or Duang,</i>

341
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,040
<i>as the new governor,</i>

342
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,560
<i>hoping he would bring relief</i>
<i>and prosperity to the people.</i>

343
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,360
Congratulations
on becoming the new governor.

344
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,880
No need for all this trouble,
Tycoon Thongyoo.

345
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,160
If I need something, I'll tell you myself.

346
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,600
Not at all. I'm truly delighted.

347
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,040
Please, Your Excellency,

348
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,600
don't forget to support
and patronize me as well.

349
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,160
Don't worry.

350
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,840
If someone's good to me,
I return the favor.

351
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Just don't be stingy with me.

352
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,480
Whatever we get, we split 50-50.
That's how we can live together.

353
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,760
Yes, sir.

354
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,520
Hey, lift it carefully. These chests

355
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,960
are full of expensive jewelry.

356
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Can I have that chest, Father?

357
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,320
Take it, my dear.

358
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Hey, Duen,

359
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,240
I want one too.

360
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,520
- Hot water, sir.
- Tim,

361
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,800
you're useful.
You know what I want before I even say it.

362
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,400
Without Your Excellency's support,

363
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,160
I wouldn't have risen
to become Khun Phaeng as I am today.

364
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,200
Blood is thicker than water.

365
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,760
You're my nephew.

366
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,000
Your father was my close friend.

367
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,160
He entrusted you to me before he died.

368
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,120
If I'm comfortable,
you get to be comfortable too.

369
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,680
I'll serve Your Excellency with my life.

370
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,760
Khun Yod Pakdee requests an audience, sir.

371
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,440
Khun Yod Pakdee requests an audience, sir.

372
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,600
Who?

373
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,280
The Village Chief from Khuan Phra-ngam.

374
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,280
He's arrogant and full of himself.

375
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,960
He never bows to anyone.
He'd rather break than bend.

376
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,240
- I'm afraid--
- Go bring him in.

377
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,040
Pardon, sir?

378
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,840
I said go bring him in. Are you deaf?

379
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,000
Yes, sir.

380
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,040
Let's go.

381
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,520
His name is Bandit Ring.

382
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,600
He's been lying in wait to rob and murder
traveling merchants in Khuan Phra-ngam.

383
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,720
Please, Your Excellency,
punish them decisively.

384
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Hey, are you really bandits or not?

385
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,480
They won't admit it.

386
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,120
I think you arrested the wrong men.

387
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,520
They're in denial.

388
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,920
I caught them red-handed,
and they still dare deny it.

389
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,640
And where's the victim? Did you bring him?

390
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,920
The traveling merchant
is too afraid for his life.

391
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
He won't come
to file a complaint himself, sir.

392
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,480
No complainant,

393
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,920
then I don't know how to judge.

394
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,840
The law has its rules, sir.

395
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,320
Then judge according to the city code.

396
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,040
Wow. Who's the governor here,
and who's the Village Chief?

397
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,480
It's His Excellency's first day
as governor,

398
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,680
and you're already giving him a headache.

399
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,000
That's enough, Tim.

400
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,000
Don't snap at each other in front of me.

401
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
I think you should go back now.

402
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,080
As for these men,
I'll see that justice is done.

403
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,960
Then I'll take my leave, sir.

404
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,000
Hey.

405
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,600
How much do you have?

406
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,040
Let a tiger back into the forest,
let fish back into the water…

407
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,320
This city is doomed.

408
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,080
Yiam. Yiam.

409
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Help me.

410
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,960
What is it, ma'am?

411
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,720
Daeng, my baby, he won't stop crying.

412
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,120
It gets worse at night.

413
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
I've tried healers, I've tried doctors.
Nothing works.

414
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
I'm scared a ghost is eating him.

415
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,240
Let me see your baby's symptoms.

416
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,680
It's not a ghost, ma'am.

417
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,120
Then what is it?

418
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,840
Your baby gets bloated at night.

419
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,480
Just take white candle wax,
cardamom, clove,

420
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,080
nutmeg, mace,

421
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,320
stonebreaker herb,
mulberry leaf, sawat leaf,

422
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,840
black purgative, asafoetida,

423
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,280
neraphusi,
long pepper, Indian borage leaf,

424
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,800
and holy basil leaf. Pound them fine.

425
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
Mix with rice-washing water,

426
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,120
roll it into balls the size of kapok
seeds, and give it to him. He'll be fine.

427
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,520
You remember, right?

428
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,040
I'll go to the market and get the herbs.

429
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,720
If my baby gets better,

430
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,280
I'll be your servant for life, Yiam.

431
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,360
No need, ma'am.

432
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,680
Just don't let Dad know
I've been secretly treating your baby.

433
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,080
Where have you been?

434
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,880
I was just walking
around the market in town.

435
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,680
Don't let me find out

436
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
you've been sneaking around
using the healer skills I taught you

437
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
to treat people again.

438
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,720
Come on, Yiam. Eat.

439
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,640
Today we have
the fish-belly curry you like.

440
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
- Yes, Mom.
- Come on.

441
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,000
But Dad, isn't it good
for Yiam to heal people?

442
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,880
I think it earns merit.

443
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,200
Being a healer is good.
But in a wild place like this,

444
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,440
being Village Chief
helps more people than being a healer.

445
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
But I don't want to go around
fighting and stabbing people, Dad.

446
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,800
You being Village Chief is good enough.

447
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,720
And if one day I'm gone,

448
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,600
who will the people
of Khuan Phra-ngam rely on?

449
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,720
Well,

450
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,240
they'll rely on the next Village Chief.
Right, Yam?

451
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,760
That's true.

452
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,120
This boy, always talking back.

453
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
Alright, alright.

454
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,080
Whatever you want to be, I won't stop you.

455
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,400
As long as you're a good person
and don't harm anyone.

456
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,560
Yes, Mom.

457
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,720
Please let me
go study medicine in the capital.

458
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,320
I'll learn both Thai medicine
and Western medicine.

459
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,760
Just for three years. Then I can graduate
and become a healer who treats people.

460
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,640
No means no.

461
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm sending you to study the occult arts

462
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,640
with Old Master Khrua Phut at Khao Phrom.

463
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,880
When you're done, you'll have sacred
knowledge to help people in hardship.

464
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,920
You know I'm not interested
in things I can't see.

465
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,960
I want to be a healer, not a sorcerer.

466
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,480
Hey. Who told you to be a sorcerer?

467
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,080
I'm sending you to learn white magic,
not black magic.

468
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,600
Black or white, I don't care.

469
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,120
Even if you force me to study it,
I won't finish anyway.

470
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,560
I'd rather spend that time
memorizing herbal texts.

471
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,840
One day you'll regret not believing me

472
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,480
Oh, Dad, that mountain on the north side
of our district…

473
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,440
Are there people living there?

474
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,440
No.

475
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,760
Then I guess that woman I met was a ghost.

476
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,920
Whoa.

477
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,840
Uncle Niem,

478
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,640
you scared me to death.

479
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,760
Afraid your father will catch you
and whip you again?

480
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,160
He won't hit me, not like Lasor.

481
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,240
If you hadn't told me, I'd think Dad
picked Lasor up and raised him like Nui.

482
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,800
They say if you love your buffalo, tie it.
If you love your child, beat them.

483
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,120
He hits him because he loves him,

484
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,640
so he won't do wrong again.

485
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,440
Uncle Niem,

486
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,200
have you ever thought
about living outside this territory?

487
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,720
- No.
- Why?

488
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,080
Danger is everywhere out there.

489
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,040
Living in bandit territory is safer.

490
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,680
At least Wad can
cast spells to blind eyes,

491
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,480
to cut us off
so outsiders can't interfere.

492
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,560
Are you tired of this place, Yiwha?

493
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,960
I don't know. I just…

494
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,600
want to do what I want sometimes.

495
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,480
You know what?

496
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,480
The older you get,
the less freedom you have.

497
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,120
Sometimes you'll have to
force yourself to do things

498
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,120
you never thought you'd want to do.

499
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,360
"It's called <i>Wittaya.</i>
Its fruit is two-edged,

500
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,320
cool as gourd,
known to cure all kinds of toxins."

501
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,400
"<i>Khun Plao Yai Plao Noi,</i>

502
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,880
hot in nature, fragrant and pungent,

503
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,600
effective in dispersing all bodily winds."

504
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,000
"He joined in lustful union with
the mermaid, cool as playing in water,

505
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,480
languid, soaked in delight,
his longing fully satisfied."

506
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,960
"He leaned in close, tender and clever,

507
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,760
entwined, unbroken,
with the young maiden."

508
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,800
Yiam, what does "lustful union" mean?

509
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,040
Grown-up stuff.
When you're older, you'll know.

510
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,520
Can't I know now?

511
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,320
No.

512
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,520
Why do grown-ups have so many secrets?

513
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,280
Fine. I don't want to know anymore.

514
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,280
Yiam.

515
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,320
Can I ask you something?

516
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,600
Behind the mountains north
of our district, there's a hidden city.

517
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,040
Have you ever heard of it?

518
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,680
A hidden city?

519
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,000
People say

520
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,280
they've seen a beautiful woman,

521
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,800
and then she vanished
into the thicket over there.

522
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,720
And how do you know I'm not from here?

523
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,400
<i>Blur.</i>

524
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,120
Wait. I don't even know your name.

525
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,320
<i>Blur!</i>

526
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,320
They say she's from that hidden city.

527
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,440
But I think she's a forest nymph.

528
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,760
Nonsense. A fairy tale to scare kids.
I don't believe it.

529
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,800
Just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it isn't there.

530
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,240
Look at <i>Phra Aphai Mani.</i>
He even had a child with a mermaid.

531
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,720
I'm not talking to you anymore.

532
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,200
Oh?

533
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,040
Hey, Yiam.

534
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,560
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

535
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,680
We're not done talking!

536
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,200
Tell me what "lustful union" means.

537
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,920
What's wrong with him?

538
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,600
Yiam.

539
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,680
What is it, Uncle Boon?

540
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,560
Why are you being so sneaky?

541
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,800
You have a rotten groin?

542
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,080
Don't be loud.

543
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,080
I don't even know
where to hide my face anymore.

544
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,920
I don't know
when mine is going to rot off.

545
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
We have to treat it fast.

546
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,320
If the wound spreads and eats through
to the base, you'll die immediately.

547
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,360
Yiem, please help me.

548
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,360
Consider it merit.

549
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,360
I want to die of old age

550
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,200
with all 32 parts intact.

551
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,600
But Dad forbids me from
treating random people.

552
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,280
Only you and I know this.

553
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,400
If you don't help me,

554
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,160
I'm going to die for sure.

555
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,680
Oh my…

556
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,320
Please…

557
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,040
Where are you taking me, Lasor?

558
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,880
I'm going to see someone
who will teach me sorcery.

559
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,480
Who?

560
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,480
Who?

561
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,520
Don't tell me…

562
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,840
Wait for me.

563
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,040
Uncle,

564
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,840
someone's coming.

565
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,920
Hey.

566
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,880
I come in peace.

567
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,680
Lasor, son of Bandit Wad,

568
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,840
traveling all this way to see me.

569
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
How heartwarming.

570
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,840
I have something I want your help with.

571
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,360
Am I hearing things?

572
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,440
The son of the great bandit Wad

573
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,600
begging a pirate like me for help?

574
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,520
Don't trust him, Uncle.
This could be one of Bandit Wad's tricks.

575
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,520
Easy, Pae.

576
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,400
Go on, tell me.
What do you want me to help with?

577
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,840
Have you seen Lasor and Nui?

578
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,840
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Were you looking for him for something?

579
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,400
No, I just have a bad feeling.

580
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,680
I'm afraid he's gone out
to stir up trouble again.

581
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,240
The wounds haven't even healed yet. He
wouldn't dare go looking for trouble now.

582
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,080
You don't know Lasor well enough.

583
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,280
Teach you sorcery?

584
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
I…

585
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,560
I could laugh until my teeth fall out.

586
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,240
What's so funny about that?

587
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,360
Hey.

588
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Your father, Bandit Wad, was a disciple
of Old Master Khrua Phut of Khao Phrom

589
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,360
from the same generation as Khun Yod.
Why didn't you ask him to teach you?

590
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,520
I asked him. He refused.
That's why I came to you.

591
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,240
For as long as I can remember,
Wad and I have never crossed paths.

592
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,280
Why should I trust you?

593
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,480
Let's go back.

594
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,160
If you want to go, go ahead.

595
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,960
Did you hear me?
I asked why I should trust you.

596
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,280
Tell me what you want me to do.
I'll do anything.

597
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,000
Good.

598
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,800
I like someone with courage.

599
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,800
<i>Where do you get the nerve</i>
<i>to treat people like that?</i>

600
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,760
Dad!

601
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,680
If you make a mistake and someone dies,

602
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,640
do you have the means to repay them?

603
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,640
Didn't I order you
not to get involved with those pirates?

604
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,400
- Huh?
- Dad, enough!

605
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,960
I heard what you talked about with Dad.

606
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,320
Why is he so afraid of that prophecy?

607
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,840
What prophecy?

608
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,600
Yiam, I'm in trouble.

609
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,960
- What happened?
- My buffalo is missing.

610
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,080
Are you done yet?
I hear people coming. Hurry!

611
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,040
Hey! Are you stealing
the governor's buffalo?

612
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,480
<i>Look at that huge tusk.</i>

613
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,160
<i>That must be the Boar King!</i>

614
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
<i>They say the Boar King has crystal tusks</i>

615
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,200
<i>that make one invincible.</i>
<i>Lasor must be after them.</i>

616
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,760
