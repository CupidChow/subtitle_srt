1
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
Let them do what they want.

2
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,480
I'm afraid.

3
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm afraid that prophecy will come true.

4
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,040
Just don't let Dad know
I've been secretly treating your baby.

5
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't let me find out

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,760
you've been sneaking around
using the healer skills I taught you

7
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,560
to treat people again.

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,520
Behind the mountains north
of our district, there's a hidden city.

9
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,080
A hidden city?

10
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,760
They've seen a beautiful woman

11
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,160
and then she vanished
into the thicket over there.

12
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
I have something I want your help with.

13
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,680
For as long as I can remember,
Wad and I have never crossed paths.

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
Tell me what you want me to do.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,160
I'll do anything.

16
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
Fine. I'll teach you sorcery.

17
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
In exchange,
bring me the Boar King's tusk.

18
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
The Boar King's tusk?
Where are we supposed to find that?

19
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,640
Then let your brother go get it
if he's got the guts.

20
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,480
But the Boar King is a sacred beast.

21
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,720
It has supernatural power.
Blades and bullets can't harm it.

22
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Who could possibly kill it?

23
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
This is sacred black coral.

24
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,800
It grants invulnerability and protection.

25
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
Fine.

27
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,880
I'll bring you the Boar King's tusk.

28
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
It's just a wild boar.

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,280
How dangerous could it be?

30
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,760
The remedy needs climbing vine,

31
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,960
ebony bark,

32
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
water spinach root,

33
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,960
hoof fungus, dung fungus,

34
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,560
fairy-root, mong root.

35
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
Everything's here,

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,560
except Nang Yaem root.

37
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,360
Are you asleep yet, Lasor?

38
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
Lasor.

39
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,280
Lasor.

40
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Lasor.

41
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,720
Nui?

42
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Where's Lasor? Where did he go?

43
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
I can't tell you.
He told me not to tell anyone.

44
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Nui, if you don't tell me,
I'm telling Dad.

45
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
No.

46
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Please don't tell Father Wad.

47
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,640
If he finds out, Lasor is dead for sure.

48
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Then tell me now. Where did he go?

49
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,120
Thongyoo the tycoon

50
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,800
lives right in the heart of Tha Khiri.

51
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,560
He's backed by powerful officials.

52
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,160
No one dares touch him.

53
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,600
He's seized farmland all over the area.

54
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Prices are sky-high

55
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
because everything's under his monopoly.

56
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,920
Then why not sell to the Chinese?
I hear they pay better than anyone.

57
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,320
Transport costs make it pointless.

58
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,920
So the villagers have no choice

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,480
but to let him bleed them dry.

60
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,600
Still, I need to thank you, Wad,

61
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,840
for helping us rob Thongyoo.

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
When you're in trouble, I help.

63
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,160
For now, get some rest.

64
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,560
When the timing's right,
I'll let you know.

65
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,080
Thanks, Wad.

66
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
I won't forget this.

67
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Dad.

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
He couldn't stay put
and went off to hunt the Boar King?

69
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
He's begging for death.

70
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
They say the Boar King has crystal tusks

71
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,520
that make one invincible.

72
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
Lasor must be after them.

73
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,960
When I find him,
I'll whip him until his back splits open.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,080
Niem, Yai, Nui, you're coming with me.

75
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
You, Yiwha,

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,480
go home.

77
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Can't I come with you,?
I'm worried about Lasor.

78
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,600
This is no place for a woman. Go home.

79
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,920
He's so stupid.

80
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,640
I never thought Bandit Wad's son

81
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
would be this stupid.

82
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
He really thinks killing the Boar King

83
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,559
is easy?

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,520
Dream on. Even seasoned hunters
with powerful magic went after it,

85
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,280
not a single one came back alive.

86
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm dying to see Wad's face
when he finds out

87
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,320
his son got gutted by a boar.

88
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,080
Well, Uncle… maybe not.

89
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,000
Maybe he won't die.

90
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,960
The sacred thing you gave him
might actually protect him.

91
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,160
Sacred my ass!

92
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
It's just some coral I picked up.

93
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,200
I muttered a few fake spells,

94
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,200
and that idiot believed it was sacred.

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Damn, this is fun.

96
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
So you sent him off to die?

97
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,920
You're pure evil, Uncle.

98
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
That's called being smart, you moron.

99
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,040
Using someone else's hands to kill,

100
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,080
while mine stay clean.

101
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,320
With a brain like that,
you deserve another drink.

102
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Please protect Lasor.

103
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,560
Found it, the Nang Yaem plant.

104
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
A king cobra.

105
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
Snakes come with heavy rains.
I'll teach you a spell to subdue them.

106
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,920
Instead of teaching me a snake spell,

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,920
you could teach me herbs for snake venom.

108
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,680
Better safe than sorry.
Some snakes are deadly.

109
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,040
They can kill in minutes,

110
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,240
like the king cobra. If it bites you,
there's no time to search for herbs.

111
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,240
Learn protective magic.

112
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,840
You'll need it when it matters.

113
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I wouldn't be that unlucky, Dad.

114
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,360
Don't move.

115
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,080
Help me.

116
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,160
A king cobra
only tracks movement in front of it.

117
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,200
Keep its attention on you.

118
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
What?

119
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,120
I said keep it focused on you.
I'll find an opening and kill it.

120
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,840
Killing is a sin.

121
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,040
You're about to die,
and you're worried about sin?

122
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
Who's there?

123
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,400
Come down here and talk to me.

124
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
Are you a ghost or a man?

125
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,560
If you're scared, then go back.

126
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,520
You challenging me?

127
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,600
The Boar King is coming
to lick the mineral earth.

128
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
How do you know?

129
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Watch the wind.

130
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,640
<i>Mo-thon, phut-khlon, tha-thon, ya-lut.</i>

131
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,800
Cast the spell, hold your breath,
and stab it in the throat.

132
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,080
Without my gun,
how am I supposed to shoot it?

133
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,520
It's coming.

134
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
Who is that?

135
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,400
That's the same voice. No doubt.

136
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Lucky I'm downwind.

137
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,720
If not,
I don't even want to think about it.

138
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,120
Shit, the wind changed.

139
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
Please help me.

140
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,160
<i>Cast the spell, hold your breath,</i>
<i>and stab it in the throat.</i>

141
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,200
<i>Mo-thon, phut-khlon, tha-thon, ya-lut.</i>

142
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,960
Lasor!

143
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Dad?

144
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Please forgive me.

145
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,240
If I hadn't killed you,
you would've killed him.

146
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
It's just a dead snake.

147
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,840
Do we really have to bury it
and give a eulogy?

148
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,240
A snake values its life
just like people do.

149
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,280
If you hadn't barged into its territory,

150
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,320
it wouldn't have attacked you.

151
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
Understand, Blur?

152
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,840
Blur this, Blur that. That's not my name.

153
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,080
Then what's your name?

154
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,080
You tell me yours first,
then I'll tell you mine.

155
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,600
I don't care.

156
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I'll just call you Blur.

157
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,360
Blur, Blur, Blur!

158
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,960
Fine. Then I'll call you…

159
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,760
Orror.

160
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,320
Hey! Are you saying
I'm all twitchy, like some skittish filly?

161
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,000
It suits you perfectly. Orror.

162
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,640
Orror, Orror, Orror,

163
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Orror.

164
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
Blur, Blur, Blur!

165
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
Orror, Orror, Orror!

166
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,240
I can't be bothered arguing with you.

167
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
Running away because you lost?

168
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,720
Blur, Blur, Blur.

169
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,200
- Blur.
- Orror.

170
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,080
Are you sick?

171
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,600
No. Why?

172
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,880
Your face is as red as a tamarind gourd.

173
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,280
Do you want me to check you?

174
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,440
It's almost daylight.

175
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,040
You're from… the Hidden City, right?

176
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,200
Oh, Yiam.

177
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,520
You scared me.

178
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,880
You're up very early, ma'am.

179
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,520
I haven't slept at all.

180
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,240
Oh? Why?

181
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm afraid the buffalo will be stolen.

182
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,720
Especially now, the work buffalo
at the Tha Khiri's governor's sugar mill

183
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
have a disease and are dying off in herds.

184
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
It's hit the sugar factory owners hard.

185
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,720
So those damned thieves keep stealing
villagers' buffalo and selling them,

186
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
because the price is good.

187
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,880
Ever since my dad became
Village Chief of Khuan Phra-ngam,

188
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
there haven't been many robberies.

189
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,440
Just hearing Khun Yod Pakdee's name
makes them run for their lives.

190
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't worry, ma'am.

191
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Khuan Phra-ngam and Tha Khiri
are right next to each other.

192
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,280
It's just a short walk away.
How could I not worry?

193
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,600
Then how about this?
If you still don't feel safe,

194
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,840
I'll figure out a way to protect them.

195
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,800
If you do that,
won't thieves still steal them, Yiam?

196
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,160
I'll smear lime behind its ear.

197
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,680
Even if they steal it, we can track it
and get it back. Don't worry.

198
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,080
Yiam.

199
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,440
You're here. Something big happened.

200
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,400
Is someone hurt?

201
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,320
Don't ask yet.
Once we get home, you'll know.

202
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
- I'm heading out, ma'am.
- Okay.

203
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
Dad!

204
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,680
I risked my life, killed the Boar King,
and brought back its tusks

205
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,480
and you shot them to pieces!

206
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,160
Or did you want to test it
to see if the Boar King's tusks were real?

207
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
Is this the time to joke, Nui?

208
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,520
Every damn day you give me headaches.

209
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,200
If that Boar King
had gored you to death, then what?

210
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,080
I killed it, Dad.

211
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,000
Instead of praising me,
you're yelling at me?

212
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Let me ask you this.

213
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
Have I ever mattered to you?

214
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,280
Everything I do is wrong.

215
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
Lasor!

216
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
If Wad didn't love you,

217
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,600
he wouldn't have brought the whole village
out to search for you.

218
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,440
The more I forbid you,
the harder you push back.

219
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
I say it's wrong, you insist it's right.

220
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,640
Listen to me, Lasor.
You had no protective magic at all,

221
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,440
yet you still went alone
to hunt the Boar King?

222
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,880
How can you be that reckless, huh?

223
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
Why? Does your life mean nothing to you?

224
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,440
Don't you love yourself?

225
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm not dying that easily. Don't worry.

226
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,040
Even if I don't have magic like you…

227
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
I've got something good on me.

228
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,800
Something good? What is it?

229
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,520
This, Dad. This is it.

230
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
Black coral?

231
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Yes.

232
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,200
Who gave it to you? The pirates?

233
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Who gave it to you?

234
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,440
Dad!

235
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,360
- Dad!
- How the hell is a piece of scrap stone

236
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,440
supposed to protect you?

237
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
One step,
and I could crush it under my foot.

238
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,400
That's not true. I don't believe you.

239
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,200
So you believe those filthy pirates
more than your own father?

240
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,240
Burn this into that head of yours, Lasor,

241
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,880
you're alive

242
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,280
because your time hasn't come yet.

243
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,000
Not because of some worthless little rock.
Stop being stupid.

244
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,320
Yeah, I'm stupid, Dad.

245
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm pathetic.

246
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,040
I don't even deserve to be your son.

247
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,120
Go on.

248
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,040
Beat me to death.

249
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,560
Don't you dare challenge me, Lasor.

250
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,080
Yiam is here.

251
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,600
What's happening, Dad?

252
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,840
You're back, you troublemaker.

253
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,960
The medicine you gave me,

254
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,760
it seemed to work during the day,

255
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,840
but once night fell,
he became feverish again.

256
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,680
You went and treated people again,
didn't you?

257
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Where do you get the nerve
to treat people like that?

258
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
Come with me. Now.

259
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,040
I'll fetch a doctor to your house.
For today, go home first, alright?

260
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,240
Dad.

261
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,600
I told you already, didn't I?

262
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't go around
treating people recklessly.

263
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,840
Your medical knowledge
is worth less than a toad's tail.

264
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,440
You're just stealing bits and pieces,

265
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,800
reading what I made you transcribe.

266
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,880
If you make a mistake and someone dies,
do you have the means to repay them?

267
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,720
That's why I asked
to study medicine in the capital,

268
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,000
so I can come back
and treat them properly.

269
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,960
A stubborn show-off like you
isn't fit to be a doctor.

270
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,800
Where have you been?

271
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,400
Why are you back so late?

272
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
I went up to pray on the hill.

273
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,880
Just to pray?

274
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,400
And I helped someone
who was bitten by a king cobra.

275
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,480
Don't let your father find out.

276
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,080
He already doesn't want you
wandering outside.

277
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,120
Yes, Uncle.

278
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,080
Has Lasor come back yet?

279
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,320
You ungrateful son!

280
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,720
I'll whip you until you learn your lesson!

281
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,760
Didn't I order you
not to get involved with those pirates?

282
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,720
They can't be trusted. They tricked you
and you didn't even realize it!

283
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,560
Dad, stop!

284
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,720
Lasor won't dare do it again.

285
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,240
Stubborn like him?

286
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,680
You think he'll listen?

287
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,960
Dad!

288
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,400
Please, I beg you. He's already hurt,
he's barely alive.

289
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,760
- Don't you help him.
- Father Wad.

290
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,920
Beat me instead.

291
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm the one who took Lasor to them.

292
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
Nui,

293
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
don't stop him.

294
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,880
If he wants to beat me to death,

295
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,160
let him.

296
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,400
Nui,

297
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,480
get your big brother out of my sight.

298
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,640
I don't want to see his face.

299
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,880
Lasor.

300
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,440
- Lasor.
- Brother.

301
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
- Lasor.
- Lasor.

302
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
<i>I'm not sure</i>

303
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,680
whether I should tell the children

304
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,920
about Grandma Chi Pa Khao's prophecy.

305
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
If you were going to tell them,

306
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,280
you would've told them long ago.
You wouldn't wait until now.

307
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,800
My wife and I were afraid

308
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,400
that prophecy would become
a scar in their hearts.

309
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,520
If word gets out and people find out,

310
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,920
they'll hate Yiwha and Lasor,

311
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,280
call them cursed,
bringing trouble to others.

312
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,560
Don't worry
about what hasn't happened yet.

313
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,760
It only makes your heart
miserable for nothing.

314
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,000
I mean to raise them well,

315
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
to change their fate.

316
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
To make sure the other two parts
of the prophecy never come true.

317
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,320
No power is greater than karma.

318
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,080
Karma's results

319
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,800
don't follow belief. They follow truth.

320
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,400
All things arise
from causes and conditions.

321
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,040
You reap what you sow.

322
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,120
When you create good causes,
good results will follow.

323
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,480
Hurry and apply this
before the abscess bursts.

324
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,440
That way your manhood won't rot.

325
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,880
And for now, stay away from the brothel.

326
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,440
No more. I've learned my lesson.

327
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,960
Thank you so much, Yiam.

328
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,600
Alright.

329
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,679
So you're really not going
to treat anyone anymore?

330
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,639
It's my dad's order.

331
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,600
What can I do?
I don't want to go against him.

332
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,719
Such a shame.

333
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,040
If you ever got to study medicine,

334
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,560
you'd be a great doctor,
helping so many people.

335
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
Aren't you going to read
<i>"Phra Aphai Mani"</i> in the library?

336
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,440
Father chained the door shut.
No idea what he's so protective of.

337
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,080
He's angry I snuck out to treat people, so
he banned me from reading medical texts,

338
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,520
and you ended up losing
your Wat Ko tales too.

339
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,440
Don't you want to be
a village chief like Dad?

340
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,600
I don't want trouble with anyone.
I want to study medicine,

341
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
work at Siriraj Hospital.

342
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,680
Then I can bring our family
to settle in the capital.

343
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,160
Why move? It's already good here.

344
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Tha Khiri is full of bandit dens.

345
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,400
I don't want you and Mom
risking your lives here.

346
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,440
With Dad here,
what's there to be afraid of?

347
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,480
So what story
do you want to hear today? I'll tell you.

348
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,800
<i>"Phra Aphai Mani."</i>

349
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
How's Lasor doing?

350
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
He still hasn't woken up.

351
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,160
Too bad for him.

352
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
Uncle Niem,

353
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,600
the other day I heard you
talking to Dad about the prophecy.

354
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,040
What really happened?

355
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,160
Why is he so afraid of it?

356
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,120
What prophecy?

357
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,400
Where's that damn Chi Pa Khao hag?

358
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,320
I'm going to kill her.

359
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,280
Didn't you promise that if I told you,
you wouldn't let it get to you?

360
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
How can I sit still?

361
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,160
If that filthy hag hadn't run her mouth,

362
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,360
I'd have learned sorcery ages ago.

363
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,720
Why didn't he ever tell me
and Lasor about this?

364
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,680
Some things aren't worth remembering.

365
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,840
Maybe he just loves himself
and is too scared to die.

366
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,880
Don't talk like that, Lasor.

367
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,280
Your father isn't afraid of dying.

368
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,120
He's afraid he'll die
by his own child's hand.

369
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
He doesn't want you two to rot in hell.

370
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,160
That's why he wants you
to escape that fate.

371
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,760
The prophecy said you'd bring
a great catastrophe to Chum Suea,

372
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,960
and I'll bring death to my own father.

373
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,960
If he's been haunted
by Grandma Chi Pa Khao's words,

374
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,640
then we have to make sure
the other two parts

375
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,200
never come true.

376
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
How?

377
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,240
You have to help me.

378
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,440
Four <i>chang,</i> two <i>tamlueng.</i>

379
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,120
Phraya Raksa Thani.

380
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,600
Two jars of pickled lychees.
Four bolts of silk.

381
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,280
Six porcelain bowls.

382
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,720
Fourteen <i>chang</i>, three baht, two <i>fueang.</i>

383
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,920
Did you price it wrong, Pa?
Why is it so expensive?

384
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
You know

385
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,080
what it takes just to get goods ashore?

386
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,000
We had to gamble
on whether pirates would raid the ship

387
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,920
and whether we could even land the cargo.

388
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,720
And we still have to pay fees
to Phraya Dechanurak.

389
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
What's left is a fistful of profit.

390
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,800
At this price, it's still cheap.

391
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,320
Where are you going?
You're not done with the accounts.

392
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,080
Being a merchant is this hard,

393
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,880
and you still want me
to inherit the business?

394
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
You little brat.

395
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,800
You don't want to be a boss?

396
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,960
Then how are you going to be a real man?

397
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,760
I've taught you since you were a kid,

398
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
to the point
my mouth's about to tear to my ears,

399
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,880
and none of it's gotten
into that thick head of yours?

400
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,240
You nag me every day,

401
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,720
but I still want to serve in government.

402
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,880
Haven't you heard what they say?

403
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,920
"Ten merchants aren't worth one official."

404
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,080
Forget those police-whatever jobs.
I'm not allowing it.

405
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,520
All they do is chase criminals.

406
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,760
The moment they see a blade,
they shrink back.

407
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Standing guard on the road
is all they ever do.

408
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,360
Pa,

409
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,960
that's the person's fault, not the job's.

410
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,680
Your son will become a patrol officer.
Just wait and see.

411
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,000
Chaem is waiting on the veranda
to cut your hair, sir.

412
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,160
Alright.

413
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,120
I'll come back and help
finish the accounts later, okay?

414
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,040
Hey, hey, hey.

415
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,360
Pun! Come help me first!
Where are you going?

416
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,600
Oh my…

417
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,040
Hello, Uncle Chaem.

418
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,080
Hey, Chang.

419
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,840
Let me help.

420
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,640
Thank you, Chang.

421
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,920
Uncle Chaem, please take your time
cutting Pa's hair today.

422
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,360
If you finish too fast,
I'll get dragged back to work too soon.

423
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,320
We were thinking of seeing Yiam.

424
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,760
Khun Yod's keeping him on a tight leash.
Doesn't look like he can leave the house.

425
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,920
I knew it.
Every time I invited you, you never came.

426
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,480
Just don't go stirring up trouble again,
you two.

427
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,680
- Yes.
- Alright. We'll head off then.

428
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,560
Where are you two off to now?

429
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,120
Every time you bunch up together,
something happens.

430
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,000
You're always leaving me
to clean up after you.

431
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,960
Since you were kids, you've never changed.

432
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,200
These kids…

433
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,840
Saeng, Khun Paeng's servant,
is here to see you, sir.

434
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,600
I told him you were
in the middle of a haircut,

435
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,720
but he says it's urgent.
He has to see you right now.

436
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,160
This month,

437
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,200
Tim's already sent people
to squeeze money out of me twice.

438
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,720
Perfect.
I've been wanting a haircut anyway.

439
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,040
Chin Seng's rich.
Pay my haircut fee for me.

440
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,080
You won't even break a sweat, will you?

441
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,560
Uncle Chaem, here's the haircut fee.

442
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,200
I'll pay for Saeng myself.

443
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,520
Why would you pay for him?

444
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,720
Doesn't the government pay you wages?

445
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,120
He must be broke.

446
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,920
Otherwise he wouldn't act like a beggar.

447
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,360
It's just a haircut fee.
He can't even pay that.

448
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,040
Since he's already asking people
to feed him a haircut,

449
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
we're going to Khun Yod's house,

450
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,200
do you want to come beg for food there?

451
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,800
Chin Seng,

452
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,400
your kids have mouths this filthy
and you do nothing?

453
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,120
You just let them curse me
right to my face.

454
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,320
I may not have a title,

455
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,000
but I'm Khun Paeng's right-hand man.
Show some respect.

456
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,480
My son

457
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,440
is this handsome man here. That one's not.

458
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,680
Whose kid he is doesn't matter.

459
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,040
Tell him to apologize now.
Or this won't end well.

460
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,920
What do you want me to apologize for?

461
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,520
For Chin Seng's son
paying for your haircut?

462
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Or for inviting you
to come eat at Khun Yod's house?

463
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,720
Oh.

464
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,080
Sorry, my hand slipped.

465
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,680
Mind picking up my scissors for me?

466
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,280
Khun Paeng sent me
to discuss the tea-and-hot-water fee.

467
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,160
I didn't come for trouble.

468
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,680
But it seems
Chin Seng isn't ready to talk.

469
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,360
I'll come back another day.

470
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,560
Hey, Chaem.

471
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,680
People say you've been ordained
your whole life.

472
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,520
Your hands have only ever held scissors.

473
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,480
So you don't know blades or weapons,
is that true?

474
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
Oh, that's good.

475
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,960
Finished bathing already, dear?

476
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,320
Are you hungry?

477
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,840
Not yet.

478
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,920
What are you making?

479
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,440
Fermented beef. We had too much meat
and couldn't finish it,

480
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,280
so I'm curing it. It keeps for days.

481
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,920
Make coconut curry with it
for me sometime.

482
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,840
Of course.

483
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,840
Mom.

484
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,720
Is Dad home today?

485
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
Hm?

486
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,600
Looking for him?
Going to make up with him?

487
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,680
That's good. Don't stay angry
with your father too long.

488
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,800
If he's not home,

489
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,720
I want to sneak into the library
and read the medical texts.

490
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,600
He went out.
He might be back late this evening.

491
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,640
If he's out, can I have the key?

492
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,240
You…

493
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,760
Wait a second.

494
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,600
Here.

495
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,240
Thanks, Mom.

496
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,360
Your father told me that when he takes you
to study at Khao Phrom,

497
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,200
he'll ask Old Master Khrua Phut
to teach you medicine-making too.

498
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,720
But I heard

499
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,840
Old Master Khrua Phut chooses
what each student learns.

500
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,680
He might not let me study medicine-making.

501
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,280
- Yiam!
- Yiam, are you home?

502
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,880
Pun, Chang,

503
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,920
I'm here.

504
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,680
I heard your father tore you apart?

505
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,280
Yeah.

506
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,640
Look at you,
droopy as a miserable chicken.

507
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,800
Don't tell me
you were sniffling and crying.

508
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,440
This idiot.

509
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,600
No, I didn't cry.

510
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,760
Are you sure you're okay?

511
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,960
We were supposed to go
to Pun's house, and you didn't come.

512
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh, yeah.

513
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,400
I kept thinking
about the fight with my dad.

514
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,680
Come on.
Fathers and sons fight, it passes.

515
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,840
Don't overthink it,
or you'll get constipated.

516
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,880
Yiam, I'm in trouble.

517
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,600
What happened, ma'am?

518
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,400
My buffalo is missing. I've searched
everywhere and can't find it.

519
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,320
What happened, Yiam?

520
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,120
Pun, Chang, come with me.

521
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,680
Your Excellency,

522
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,480
the stolen buffalo has already
trampled several loads of sugarcane.

523
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,480
Ever since I moved here,
everything's been easy.

524
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,240
No need to watch my back
like in the capital.

525
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,960
And last night,
we got another one too, sir.

526
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,280
My men are flawless, no faults at all.

527
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,000
They've tied it up behind the sugar mill.

528
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,440
Those bandits stole buffalo
and sold them until the pens overflowed.

529
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,760
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,960
Good.

531
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,800
That one's my neighbor's buffalo.

532
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,160
Buffalo all have two horns and four legs.

533
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,840
How do you know it's the same one?

534
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah.

535
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,560
Look behind its ear.
I smeared lime paste there.

536
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,640
Damn, Yiam,

537
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,320
how did you even think of that?
Caught red-handed, right on the hide.

538
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Hey.

539
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,120
My father said

540
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,200
the sugar mill, the gambling den, and
the brothel belong to the new governor.

541
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,720
If your buffalo's tied up here,

542
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,160
does that mean the governor
is stealing villagers' buffalo?

543
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,240
A fancy noble for nothing,

544
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,000
still squeezing the villagers.

545
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,320
I'm going to tell everyone.

546
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,320
If you're taking the buffalo back,
take it, but don't make it a big deal.

547
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah, I'm with Chang.

548
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,600
I still can't even face my father
after the last mess.

549
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,000
Let's leave it for now.

550
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,720
Are you done yet?

551
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,760
Almost.

552
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,480
I hear people coming. Hurry!

553
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,000
I'm hurrying.

554
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,760
Hey! Are you stealing
the governor's buffalo?

555
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,400
Somebody!

556
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,560
Buffalo thieves!

557
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,400
Hey! No!

558
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,160
- Help!
- It's not like that.

559
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,320
Someone's stealing a buffalo!

560
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,440
Hey, they're stealing
our governor's buffalo!

561
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,960
- No.
- They are!

562
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,640
What are they crowding around for?

563
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,440
- Hey, don't talk.
- Look at them.

564
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,360
- Don't let them get away!
- My men tied the buffalo there.

565
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,920
Let's go take a look.

566
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Move! What are you crowding for?

567
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,840
And this is the governor's buffalo.
Give it back!

568
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,480
Hey. What's all this commotion?

569
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,200
Last night, thieves stole a buffalo in
Khuan Phra-ngam. I came to take it back.

570
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,720
From Khuan Phra-ngam?

571
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,120
What proof do you have
that this buffalo is yours, kid?

572
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,560
I marked it with lime paste
behind its ear.

573
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,280
Take a look.

574
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,080
Let me see.

575
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,640
It's true, Khun Paeng.

576
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,720
If it were Your Excellency's buffalo,

577
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,040
you wouldn't have lime paste
smeared behind its ear, would you?

578
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,280
You--

579
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
Hey.

580
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,720
Buffalo?

581
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,040
I can buy as many as I want.

582
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,600
If anyone thinks a governor like me
would steal villagers' buffalo,

583
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,360
then that person is more stupid
than the buffalo.

584
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,920
It's probably just a misunderstanding.

585
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,280
You found the buffalo you wanted.
Take it back.

586
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,840
Send someone to teach them a lesson.

587
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,320
Don't let them come
running their mouths at me again.

588
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,000
But that's Khun Yod Pakdee's son, sir.

589
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,120
Then don't let his father find out, idiot!

590
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
Yes, sir.

591
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,920
Did you give him
the medicine like I told you?

592
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,800
Yes, both the oral medicine
and the ointment.

593
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,440
Keep an eye on him.
See if he runs a fever.

594
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,480
If he gets worse, come tell me right away.

595
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,400
Yes.

596
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,720
Father Wad.

597
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,520
- He'd be happy to know you're worried.
- No.

598
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
Don't tell him I came.

599
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,440
A silver barb.

600
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,200
And it's huge.

601
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,360
Aunt Phon, let's cook silver barb tonight.

602
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,280
Lasor said he wanted to eat it.

603
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,720
What kind of tusk is this?

604
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,360
Let me see.

605
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,320
A boar tusk. Look at that huge tusk.

606
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,240
That must be the Boar King!

607
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,480
The Boar King?

608
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,480
They say the Boar King has crystal tusks
that make one invincible.

609
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,000
Lasor must be after them.

610
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,120
It's rare, Yihwa.

611
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,400
Keep it on you. Blades can't pierce you.

612
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,040
My goodness, I can't believe

613
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,040
it wandered into the trap.
You've got real merit.

614
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,720
Then should I give it to Dad?

615
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,280
I heard Khao Phrom's school

616
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,640
doesn't worship charms
made from tusks, ivory, shells, or horns.

617
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,840
They respect the spell craft
you carry within yourself.

618
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,840
Your father already has strong skills.

619
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,000
Just keep it.

620
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,520
Oh, and don't give it to your brother.

621
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,000
Your father doesn't want him
obsessed with cursed charms like this.

622
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,440
Is this black coral stone the real thing?

623
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,640
Of course it is.

624
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,480
I saw you bump into her on purpose
and snatch her bracelet.

625
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,800
Thanks for catching the thief for me.

626
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,000
Who's that woman?

627
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,600
Is that his wife?

628
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,040
Does this stone have any power?

629
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,840
Do you like it?

630
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,680
I like it so much.

631
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,280
Do you like the bracelet

632
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,440
or do you like me?

633
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,960
Then let me walk you home.

634
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,680
<i>Lady Duen,</i>

635
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,280
<i>pretty face, pretty name.</i>

636
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,440
<i>That's my type.</i>

637
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
<i>I like her.</i>

638
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,720
