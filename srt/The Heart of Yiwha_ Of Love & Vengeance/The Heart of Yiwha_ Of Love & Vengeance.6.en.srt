1
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,840
<i>My sister is missing.</i>

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,160
Where did she go?

3
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>Last night, Bandit Pud raided my house.</i>

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>As long as I'm alive,</i>
<i>no one will lay a hand on our daughter.</i>

5
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
I won't let you get away.

6
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
<i>Tattava Visatchetum Nasasi.</i>

7
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
I'll cut your head off!

8
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,880
<i>It's just an old tale.</i>

9
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,760
<i>It can't be real, right?</i>

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
Let's see

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
how powerful this really is.

12
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,920
<i>Si sa ta ti…</i>

13
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>‪Si sa ta ti…</i>

14
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
Dad,

15
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,800
something feels wrong.

16
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,040
Nui,

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
your brother
caused trouble again, didn't he?

18
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,920
No. He didn't do anything.

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
He just brought back an old grimoire.

20
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
What grimoire? From where?

21
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
- Lasor.
- Dad.

22
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,600
<i>Sabbe deva pisaceva.</i>

23
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,960
Dad.

24
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,600
Dad, no!

25
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,600
- Dad!
- Lasor!

26
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Lasor!

27
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,760
Why would you do this?

28
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,480
I finally found a way to learn magic.

29
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,320
Stop being stupid, Lasor.

30
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
The Mountain Spirit Grimoire
is low-level black magic.

31
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,600
It tricks you into feeding it your blood
until there's nothing left of you.

32
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
Then let me die.

33
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Black magic or white magic,

34
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,080
if I get to learn, that's enough for me.

35
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
So you'd learn filthy,
cursed magic like this?

36
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
Huh?

37
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,200
Ruining yourself isn't enough.

38
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,520
You'd drag
everyone else down with you too.

39
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,080
Whether magic is good or evil depends on
the one using it, doesn't it?

40
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
Even if you learn from the noblest sect,
if you use it to rob people,

41
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
you're still a bandit.

42
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,840
Lasor!

43
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
- You!
- Stop!

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Calm down, Wad.

45
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
This isn't the time.

46
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Dad's worried.

47
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,280
He's afraid
that cursed grimoire will kill you.

48
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
I'd die

49
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
for doing what I love.

50
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,480
You wouldn't understand, Yiwha,

51
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,320
until you have something
you love the same way.

52
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Why wouldn't I understand?

53
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,720
I love Dad. I love you.

54
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,640
I love Uncle Niem. I love everyone here.

55
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
If dying would protect them, I'd do it.

56
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,800
I know how you feel.

57
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
If you understand me,

58
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
why stop me?

59
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,440
Dad blocked you from learning magic

60
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,200
because he's afraid
you'll bring disaster to Chum Suea.

61
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,640
Nonsense.

62
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,280
Didn't we agree

63
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
we'd do anything

64
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,000
to prevent the last two prophecies
from coming true?

65
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
What does that
have to do with learning magic?

66
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Lasor…

67
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
if you love Dad,

68
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,800
just do what he wants for once.

69
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,400
I've prepared a wagon.

70
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,240
We'll flee north, crossing this mountain.

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What if they send people after us?

72
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
I'll ask a friend of mine

73
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,400
to protect us until we're safe.

74
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
Your friend?

75
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Who?

76
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Bandit Wad.

77
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
But he's a bandit, Dad.

78
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Bandit Wad and I

79
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,360
became sworn brothers
when we studied at Khao Phrom.

80
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,240
He's the only one

81
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
who can get us safely to Nakhon.

82
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
Your grandfather
is a high-ranking noble there.

83
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,680
If we reach him, we'll survive.

84
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Then we'll submit a formal petition.

85
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,040
I'll go ask Bandit Wad for help.

86
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,440
You and the children pack everything.

87
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,880
We leave tonight.

88
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Yes.

89
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,880
While I'm gone,

90
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll cast a concealment spell
on the house.

91
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
It lasts only until sunset.

92
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll be back before dusk.

93
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Take care of your mother and sister.

94
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll protect them.

95
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Don't worry.

96
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Blind their eyes so they cannot see.

97
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,840
<i>Conceal this place, keep it dormant.</i>

98
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,080
<i>Let it vanish from sight,</i>
<i>by Namo Buddhaya.</i>

99
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
Uncle Niem ordered you

100
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,640
to soak in the sacred spring

101
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
to cleanse the curse.

102
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
What curse?

103
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
Whoa.

104
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,320
The curse from
the Mountain Spirit Grimoire, of course.

105
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,040
Just talking about it gives me chills.

106
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm still scared.

107
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,600
How long do I have to

108
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
stay in the spring?

109
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Until the sun is directly overhead.

110
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
What the hell are you staring at?

111
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,400
King cobra.

112
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
- Nui!
- Nothing. Nothing.

113
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,880
Go now.

114
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,000
Alright.

115
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,320
Rueang, my only son, is dead.

116
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,360
Your Excellency must take responsibility.

117
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,640
Huh?

118
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,640
Khun Yod killed your son.

119
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,680
What does that have to do with me?

120
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,160
But my son

121
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
died at your brothel.

122
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,240
No matter what, you have to
capture him and punish him.

123
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,080
Look at me right now.

124
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,520
I can barely pee alone.

125
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,480
Where am I supposed to get
the strength to go after him?

126
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
And besides,

127
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,640
Khun Yod's magic is strong.

128
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
And he trained at the same place
as Bandit Wad too.

129
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not rushing to my own death.

130
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,720
Do you want me to help?

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,320
Who are you?

132
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,280
That's Bandit Pud.

133
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,520
He's on our side.

134
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,160
Why didn't you say so?

135
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,960
So what can you do for me, Pud?

136
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Your Excellency is the governor.

137
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,240
You have power and prestige.

138
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,680
The tycoon is rich.

139
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm a bandit with magic.

140
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,920
If the three of us join forces,

141
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
cutting off Khun Yod's head
and Bandit Wad's won't be that hard.

142
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
If you get rid of those two

143
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,200
and avenge my son,

144
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,280
I'll reward you handsomely.

145
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
It'll set you up

146
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,960
for life.

147
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,760
You won't have to

148
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,960
rob merchant ships ever again.

149
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,440
Remember what you promised me, Tycoon.

150
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Your Excellency, the police unit reports

151
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
they've captured Bandit Yai and his men.

152
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,160
Is that so?

153
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,520
The new governor is decisive.

154
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,080
He caught Bandit Yai and his men

155
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,960
and ordered them hanged immediately.
These bandits.

156
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,480
Good they're dead.

157
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,880
I heard the governor's men

158
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,640
are hunting Bandit Wad right now.

159
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,560
‪He deserves to be hanged.

160
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,880
- This world would be a better place.
- Yes.

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,920
‪It's good they're gone.

162
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,520
They don't deserve to live.

163
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
‪Duen.

164
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,280
Those bandits are hanging out there,

165
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,560
with their tongues sticking out…

166
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
It's horrifying.

167
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,160
What's wrong, Duen?

168
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
It's because of you.

169
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
You described it so vividly
I couldn't help picturing it.

170
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,760
Well, I was afraid
you wouldn't see it clearly.

171
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,520
This place is pure backwater barbarity.

172
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,360
I shouldn't have.

173
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,320
I shouldn't have followed Father
down to Tha Khiri.

174
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,280
I want to go back to the capital.

175
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,680
If you go back,

176
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,400
you won't get to see Yiam,
your handsome angel, anymore.

177
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,080
If only Yiam's father
didn't have bad blood with Father,

178
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,120
I'd feel a lot more at ease.

179
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,960
Father is father. The son is the son.

180
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
It's not related at all.

181
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,440
You can't force your heart.

182
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Hey.

183
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Are you being precocious now?

184
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
Hey!

185
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,080
Who are you? How did you get in here?

186
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
I've come to see Bandit Wad.

187
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,680
Go back, unless you want to die here.

188
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,720
I have something urgent to discuss.

189
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,080
Are you deaf or what?

190
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,280
- Kill him!
- <i>Anicca sa na appati.</i>

191
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,560
Move aside.

192
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
I don't want to hurt you.

193
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,560
Don't come any closer.

194
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,760
Stand aside.

195
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,240
I've already sent word to Nakhon.

196
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
My father-in-law will send people
to meet us at the city entrance.

197
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,560
Please protect my wife and children.

198
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,560
Have you checked the timing?
When are you leaving?

199
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,320
Third watch tonight.

200
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
I'll come get you
at the forest edge by the foothills.

201
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,520
Wait there.

202
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,800
I'll escort all of you
all the way to Nakhon.

203
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,800
Thanks, Wad.

204
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,080
Yod,

205
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,680
there's something I want to ask you.

206
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,760
What is it?

207
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,920
- Lasor!
- Nui!

208
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,880
What's going on out there?
I can hear gunshots all the way here.

209
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,160
Khun Yod,

210
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
Village Chief of Khuan Phra-ngam,
came to Chum Suea.

211
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,720
And my father? Does he know yet?

212
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,120
He knows. Father Wad says they're friends.

213
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
Friends?

214
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
My father has a village chief as a friend?

215
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
I don't know.

216
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,880
But I saw Khun Yod use magic too.

217
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
They fired guns and crossbows at him.

218
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960
Nothing happened.

219
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
Maybe they've been friends
since their days at Khao Phrom.

220
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
A friend from Khao Phrom?

221
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh?

222
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,920
I thought you'd follow me
all the way back to my house.

223
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,160
What do you want?

224
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,200
You trained at Khao Phrom
with my father, didn't you?

225
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,040
Yes.

226
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,680
I want to learn sorcery with you.

227
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,480
Your son can't be worse than mine.

228
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,040
Mine gives me trouble every single day.

229
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm sending him to study
under Old Master Khrua Phut at Khao Phrom.

230
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,720
Will you send your child too?

231
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,080
No.

232
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't want him learning sorcery.

233
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,760
You send yours.

234
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
Please.

235
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,320
Teach me magic, Master.

236
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
- I'm not taking students.
- Why not?

237
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,400
No means no.

238
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,600
Wait.

239
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
Do you know

240
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,480
the heart of knife-throwing?

241
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
What is it?

242
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,520
Focus.

243
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,600
Focus is steadiness of the mind.

244
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,400
A steady mind that doesn't waver

245
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,000
can guide the knife
with perfect precision.

246
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,680
I guess I don't have any focus today.

247
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
So where did your heart go?

248
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Was it that young man who bought you
the human-faced bead bracelet?

249
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,360
Uncle Niem…

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
I've lived longer than you.

251
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
Why wouldn't I know?
I can tell you're in love.

252
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,040
Uncle, don't tell Dad, okay?

253
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,720
He already has a headache over Lasor.

254
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,880
I don't want to add another.

255
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
I know.

256
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,480
I just wanted to warn you.

257
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Don't love someone so much
that you forget to love yourself.

258
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,800
Yiam, come help me carry this over there.

259
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,440
Yiam.

260
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,600
Yiam.

261
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,520
Yes, Mom?

262
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,200
What are you thinking about?

263
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
Help me carry this over

264
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,040
so the servants can load it
onto the wagon.

265
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,280
Yes, Mom.

266
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,640
Hurry up.

267
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
Once you're done, go inside
and bring out the chest from my room.

268
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Yam!

269
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,920
- Yam.
- Yam.

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
- Yam.
- Yam.

271
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
- Help me.
- Yam.

272
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
There, there.

273
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,360
It was just a nightmare.

274
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
- Yam.
- Yam.

275
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,200
It's me. Don't be scared.

276
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,640
No! Mom…

277
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,920
- Mom…
- Yam.

278
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,880
Yam.

279
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
If I knew spells,

280
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
if I could fight like others,

281
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Yam wouldn't be like this.

282
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,120
Don't think that, son.

283
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,240
You didn't do anything wrong.

284
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
It's all because of those people.

285
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
She has a fever.

286
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,880
I'll boil some neem bark for her.

287
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,960
But we're out of neem bark at home.

288
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,680
It's fine. I'll go gather some.

289
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,520
Your father told us
not to go anywhere, Yiam.

290
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,440
I won't go far from the house.
Don't worry, Mom.

291
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,000
Be careful.

292
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
There, there.

293
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,360
I'm right here.

294
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
‪What is this?

295
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,880
You're one of Bandit Wad's men,
aren't you?

296
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
No.

297
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
Bandit Wad?

298
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,440
I don't know him.

299
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,120
This knife belongs to Chum Suea.

300
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,480
How did you get it?

301
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,440
Please let me go.

302
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,480
I've only been in Chum Suea
for a short time.

303
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Please don't hurt me.

304
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,280
If you cooperate with me,

305
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
this bag is yours.

306
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
And if

307
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,640
I don't?

308
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,720
Then I'll hand you over to the governor,

309
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,560
so you can be hanged like Bandit Yai.

310
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
You want that?

311
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,640
‪Alright, alright.

312
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,680
I'll do anything. Let go of me.

313
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,240
Guess you tricked me after all, Blur.

314
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,280
Orror.

315
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,480
Blur.

316
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,200
I'm sorry I'm late.

317
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,440
I went to gather herbs for my sister.

318
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
I came to say goodbye.

319
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Goodbye?

320
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,680
Where are you going?

321
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,160
To live with my grandfather in Nakhon.

322
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,840
Why so suddenly?

323
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,640
I have to leave.

324
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,480
The governor of Tha Khiri
won't let my father and me go.

325
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Will we ever see each other again?

326
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,840
I don't know.

327
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,840
The Boar King's tusk.

328
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Wear this around your neck.

329
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,600
It'll protect you and keep you safe.

330
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,200
It's valuable.

331
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,320
Why don't you keep it?

332
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,480
I have a short knife to protect myself.

333
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,640
But you don't have anything.

334
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,440
You should keep it.

335
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,080
I have to leave tonight.

336
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,360
Can I ask you for something, Orror?

337
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Of course.

338
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,360
Sure.

339
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
I don't know how long it'll be

340
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,320
before I see your smile again.

341
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
Can you smile for me one last time?

342
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll remember your smile today
until the day I die, Orror.

343
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,920
Don't say stupid things, Blur.

344
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
I told you I love you,

345
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,360
but you still haven't answered me.

346
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,320
Do you love me?

347
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
I love you.

348
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,120
Hearing you say you love me…

349
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,120
even if I die,

350
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,920
I won't regret my life.

351
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,920
Bandit Wad's den

352
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,440
is at the foot of the mountain
north of Khuan Phra-ngam.

353
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,720
There's the Khruea Khao Long barrier.
Bandit Wad cast a spell over it.

354
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
It's an important ward
that hides the place,

355
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,120
makes outsiders unable to see it,

356
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,840
and keeps them from wandering inside.

357
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
<i>Only those from within</i>
<i>know the entrance and exit.</i>

358
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,160
<i>I'll use</i>

359
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,560
<i>black dog's blood</i>

360
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,840
<i>to wash away the spell</i>
<i>sealing Khruea Khao Long.</i>

361
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,440
<i>That's all it takes.</i>

362
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,920
<i>Then you and your men can get inside.</i>

363
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,800
Chum, what are you doing?

364
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
You dare betray Chum Suea?

365
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,240
You bastard! I'll kill you!

366
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,400
I made a mistake!

367
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,680
- Die!
- No.

368
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,960
Chum!

369
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,760
Chum!

370
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,400
Let me go.

371
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,960
Let me go, Lasor.

372
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,520
Lasor!

373
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,120
Chum!

374
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,040
Help.

375
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,560
Help me.

376
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,320
Help me.

377
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,520
What happened?

378
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,320
‪Chum.

379
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
Lasor.

380
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
What have you done?

381
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,600
Why did you kill him?

382
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,640
What happened?

383
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,600
Lasor.

384
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,000
Chum betrayed us.

385
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,040
He used black dog's blood
to break the spell

386
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,880
you cast on Khruea Khao Long.

387
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,360
It's true, Dad.

388
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
When I came back in,

389
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,280
I saw blood all over the entrance.

390
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
And I'll deal with you later

391
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,080
for sneaking out of Chum Suea.

392
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
Dad,

393
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Chum betrayed us. He deserved to die.

394
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,160
He would've brought disaster to Chum Suea.

395
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,720
It's you, Lasor.

396
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,400
You're the one who's going
to bring disaster to my Chum Suea.

397
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,320
Dad…

398
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Tell me.

399
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
What's the rule of Chum Suea?

400
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,280
We don't kill our own people.

401
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,200
You knew the rule,

402
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,320
and you still did it.

403
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
And do you know

404
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,000
what happens

405
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,280
when someone breaks the rule?

406
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,240
Death.

407
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,560
Chum broke the rules of Chum Suea first.

408
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,200
Lasor punished him
according to the rules. That's fair.

409
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,680
Right, everyone?

410
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,640
But Lasor had no right
to judge and decide another man's life.

411
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,520
If I have no right,
then only you do, is that it?

412
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,840
Huh?

413
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,600
- Lasor!
- Lasor!

414
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,080
Lasor.

415
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,560
Lasor.

416
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,360
- Lasor.
- Lasor.

417
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,720
Even if you're my son,

418
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,960
if you break the rules,

419
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
I won't let it slide.

420
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,480
If you won't believe me,

421
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,840
then I have nothing left to say.

422
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,040
If you want to kill me,

423
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
then do it.

424
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Shoot me.

425
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
Get out of my Chum Suea.

426
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,800
From this day on,

427
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,440
you and I are finished.

428
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,720
No funeral fire.
No stepping on each other's shadow.

429
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll treat you like you're dead to me!

430
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,680
Lasor.

431
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,720
<i>All curses and misfortune, be destroyed.</i>

432
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,240
<i>Sitthi hulu, sawahaya.</i>

433
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,160
I have cast consecrated earth and water

434
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,120
to wash away the curse
of black dog's blood.

435
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,280
If you're not one of us,

436
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,040
no one will be able to see the way in.

437
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,720
Tonight, set the guards

438
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
and patrol around Chum Suea.

439
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,960
No outsiders are allowed in
under any circumstances.

440
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
Yes, sir.

441
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,880
Can you not go?

442
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,840
Dad kicked me out.

443
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,200
He doesn't want me here anymore, Yiwha.

444
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,440
I'll ask him to forgive you.

445
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,640
Wait for me here.

446
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,120
No, Yiwha.

447
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,000
I've decided.

448
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,440
I'm leaving Chum Suea

449
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,520
to go out into the world with Nui.

450
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,720
Yes.

451
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,520
I don't want to grow old
and die in Chum Suea.

452
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,280
I'd rather see the world with Lasor.

453
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,960
Yiwha…

454
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,880
Take care of Dad for me.

455
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,200
When I'm gone,

456
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,200
you have to take good care of yourself.

457
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,000
I have to go now.

458
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,000
Lasor…

459
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,680
You're really leaving me?

460
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,280
About Lasor, wasn't that a bit too much?

461
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,240
He grows hotter-headed every day.

462
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,080
Everything I warn him about,
he never listens.

463
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,000
It only gets worse.

464
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,560
And you saw what he did today.
He dared to kill someone.

465
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,240
It makes me feel like

466
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,240
Grandma Chi Pa Khao's prophecy
is about to come true.

467
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,360
Your son

468
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,040
will bring great ruin upon Chum Suea.

469
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,560
I didn't want this, Niem.

470
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,120
But Lasor is stubborn
and won't listen to anyone.

471
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,800
I had to cut it off at the root.

472
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,320
I had to drive him away,

473
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,040
so he would no longer…

474
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,040
So he would no longer be my son.

475
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,880
You and I are done.

476
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,600
No funeral fire.
No stepping on each other's shadow.

477
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,800
I'll treat you like you're dead to me!

478
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,480
You can still change your mind.

479
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,120
Let's go, Nui.

480
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,600
Yes. Wherever you go, I'll go too.
Where you are, that's where I'll be.

481
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,760
<i>You've driven Lasor away.</i>

482
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,920
Then what about Yiwha?
What are you going to do?

483
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm sending Yiwha

484
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,720
to be Yod's son's wife.

485
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,120
They'll run away and live somewhere else.

486
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
Once she has a husband and leaves,

487
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,040
she won't be my daughter anymore.

488
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,200
Then

489
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,280
the last prophecy will never come true.

490
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,360
Dad already drove Lasor away…

491
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,920
and now he wants
to make me someone else's wife?

492
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,440
Will you run away with me?

493
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,760
I can't go with you.

494
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,200
Why not?

495
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm worried about my father.

496
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
I'm worried about my brother.

497
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,240
And you're not worried about me at all?

498
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,640
I am.

499
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,400
But I really can't go with you.

500
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,560
I understand.

501
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,600
I said it because I was being selfish.

502
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,120
You should stay here and take care
of your father and your brother.

503
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,440
Someday, I'll find a way
to come back to you.

504
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,000
Orror,

505
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,120
wait for me.

506
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,360
Don't be with anyone else yet.

507
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,480
I'll wait for you, Blur.

508
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,640
If Dad is going to push me away,

509
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,640
then I'll go.

510
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,200
But I'll go with the one I love.

511
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,880
Where the hell is the way
into Wad's Chum Suea?

512
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,640
I think he fooled you.

513
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,760
He wouldn't dare play tricks on me.

514
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,920
That man Chum.

515
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,040
If it wasn't him,

516
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,800
then it's you trying to fool me.

517
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,960
Why the hell are you barking so much?

518
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,120
Can you shut up for a second?
I'm thinking.

519
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,800
Or maybe he found out

520
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,320
and used a blinding spell
to change the entrance?

521
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,680
Is there another way, Uncle?

522
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,000
Chum Suea is huge.

523
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,040
How could there be
only one way in and out?

524
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,080
Yes.

525
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,760
I only know this one method.

526
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,760
As for other ways,

527
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,840
I can't be sure.

528
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
What way?

529
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,440
If you're going to talk, spill everything.

530
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,000
They say

531
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,280
on the mountain north of Chum Suea,

532
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,160
there's a huge Buddha statue
standing tall.

533
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,000
When you look down from up there,

534
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,600
you only see dense forest,

535
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,240
no entrance, no exit.

536
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,680
That's because of
the statue's sacred power.

537
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
As long as the statue looks down,

538
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,120
Bandit Wad's Chum Suea

539
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,520
remains a hidden city.

540
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,840
So how do we open the way?

541
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,160
Blind the statue's eyes.

542
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,800
If the statue isn't looking down,

543
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,000
then Chum Suea

544
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,760
won't have anything sacred
protecting it anymore.

545
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,560
What the hell are you so happy about?

546
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,040
Because now I know how to raid Chum Suea.

547
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,560
We need to go now, or we'll be too late.

548
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,480
A barn owl…

549
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,080
Maybe we shouldn't leave tonight.

550
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,600
No. We have to go.

551
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,680
I already arranged to meet Bandit Wad.

552
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,680
Let's go.

553
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,920
Can we really trust Bandit Wad, Dad?

554
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,600
Bandit Wad and I

555
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,120
have been secretly helping villagers
for a long time.

556
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,200
Villagers who were oppressed

557
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,520
could finally survive because Bandit Wad

558
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,600
robbed the rich to help the poor.

559
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,080
<i>Every time Bandit Wad robbed the rich</i>

560
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,120
<i>who exploited the villagers,</i>

561
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,480
<i>he shared the loot with me,</i>

562
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,320
<i>so I could help the poor.</i>

563
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,400
<i>I would sell those valuables</i>
<i>in another city through Chin Yuan,</i>

564
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
<i>a tycoon I know,</i>

565
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,360
<i>and trade them for money, rice, crops,</i>

566
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,720
<i>and essential supplies</i>

567
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,400
<i>to distribute to the villagers.</i>

568
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,960
<i>Farmers and villagers sold their goods</i>

569
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,720
<i>at Chin Yuan's shop</i>

570
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,320
<i>because it paid</i>
<i>the best price in all of Tha Khiri</i>

571
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,720
<i>thanks to funding from Bandit Wad,</i>
<i>who robbed corrupt tycoons.</i>

572
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,600
He's still a bandit.
Even if he's your friend,

573
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,560
I still don't trust him.

574
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,440
And what in our lives right now

575
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,800
can we truly trust?

576
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,520
Even governors and officials

577
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,600
behave no differently from bandits.

578
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
This world isn't just black and white.

579
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,400
No one is purely good,

580
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,360
and no one is purely evil.

581
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,760
One day, you'll understand.

582
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,680
I'll escort all of you
all the way to Nakhon.

583
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Thanks, Wad.

584
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,160
There's something I want to ask you.

585
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,920
What is it?

586
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,920
Take my daughter with you.

587
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,480
Why?

588
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,080
The new governor is hunting me down.

589
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,120
I don't want my daughter
to suffer because of me.

590
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,880
Your son and my daughter
are already promised.

591
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,120
They'll become husband and wife anyway.

592
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,920
Don't worry.

593
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,960
I'll take your daughter away from here,

594
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,400
and I'll care for her
like she's my own child.

595
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,480
You promised me,

596
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Yod.

597
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
It's not very burnt today.

598
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,320
Edible.

599
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,680
What is it?

600
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,280
Are you here to beg me to forgive Lasor?

601
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,920
I came to apologize to you, Dad.

602
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,960
Apologize for what?

603
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,840
For everything I ever did
that made you upset.

604
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,960
Please forgive me.

605
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,000
I'm going to run away with you,

606
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,200
Blur.

607
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,120
Wad, we're in trouble.
The governor's men are raiding Chum Suea.

608
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,680
Burn Chum Suea to the ground!

609
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,360
- Dad!
- <i>Masanamo.</i>

610
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,360
Chum Suea is finished.

611
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,840
Huh?

612
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,600
Wad, why did you kill him?

613
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,640
I'm going to skin you

614
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,320
and make a tattooed jacket out of it.

615
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,920
I told you to stab his anus!

616
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,680
- Stab!
- Dad!

617
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,440
<i>Phutthang chiwitang</i>

618
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,880
<i>yana-niphanang.</i>

619
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,240
If you two have fate together,

620
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,360
one day you'll meet again.

621
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,840
In this life, I don't think
I'll dare love anyone again.

622
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,880
I'm afraid of parting again.

623
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,680
