1
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,080
<i>Yiam has someone he loves!</i>

2
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
The woman you're seeing, who is she?

3
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,639
When will I see you again?

4
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
If we meet too often,
you'll get bored of me.

5
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,200
I won't.

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
<i>How the hell did you let her get away?</i>

7
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
First job and you already screw it up.

8
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
Thief?

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,040
What are you going to do
with the women who are being held?

10
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,280
<i>I'm afraid Bandit Pud will come here.</i>

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
<i>I'm such a pathetic loser.</i>

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,320
<i>I never do anything right.</i>

13
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
I only cause trouble.

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Whipping a man like you would be a waste.

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
In a few days, I'm leaving for Khao Phrom.

16
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,240
Didn't you say
you didn't want to get involved

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,880
since this is outside Khuan Phra-ngam?

18
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,800
When people are about to fall
into a living hell right in front of me,

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,680
how could I possibly stand by?

20
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,200
Khun Yod Pakdee,

21
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Village Chief of Khuan Phra-ngam.
Brave. Dependable.

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
No wonder the villagers trust you.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you want the villagers' faith,

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
then become
the next village chief after me.

25
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
But I'm not as capable as you.

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,960
I heal people as a doctor. The villagers
can still place their faith in that.

27
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,680
Once you study at Khao Phrom,

28
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,120
you'll gain broader judgment
and deeper understanding.

29
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
Dad,

30
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,600
could you go ask
for a woman's hand for me?

31
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll do whatever you want. Anything.

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,480
By the time you finish
studying at Khao Phrom,

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,080
the woman you like will already have
a new husband and children.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>By the time you finish</i>
<i>studying at Khao Phrom,</i>

35
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,120
<i>the woman you like will already have</i>
<i>a new husband and children.</i>

36
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,960
Orror…

37
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
will you wait for me?

38
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,920
I brought some blankets.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,840
It gets colder the later it gets.
Don't forget to cover yourselves.

40
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,760
We'll never forget
the kindness of Khun Yod and you.

41
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Do not go anywhere tonight.

42
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,600
Not until dawn.

43
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,600
Will they come after us?

44
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
They wouldn't dare.

45
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,080
Just hearing Khun Yod's name
would send them running.

46
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,160
I feel sticky. I want to bathe.

47
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
Me too. I want to go to the fields.

48
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,400
But Aunt Im said

49
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,800
we shouldn't go anywhere until dawn.

50
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,080
This is Khun Yod's house.
Nothing will happen.

51
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,040
The bathing pier is right there.
We'll be quick.

52
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Then let's all go together. If something
happens, we can help each other.

53
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,120
Come on.

54
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,840
Where are they going?

55
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Are you sure
they're keeping them in there?

56
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes, Uncle. I saw it with my own eyes.

57
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,880
What about the black dog's blood
I told you to prepare?

58
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,880
Here. A full jar.

59
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,920
Good. No matter how skilled Khun Yod is,

60
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
once I block his sorcery,

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
he'll be nothing but a rotten dog.

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,440
Pae, wait until…

63
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,080
What's wrong with you?
Scratching like a monkey.

64
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm itchy, Uncle. Look.

65
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,720
You idiot. That's cowitch.
Get away from it.

66
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,600
Whoa! No wonder I'm itching like hell.

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,160
Be quiet.

68
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,640
Go back. You'll ruin my whole plan. Go.

69
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
What rotten luck…

70
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Go.

71
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,680
Are you done yet?

72
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,920
Just a moment.

73
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Mom told you not to come outside.

74
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
So itchy…

75
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Yam.

76
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
Where are they? Where did they go?

77
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,240
Maybe they hid somewhere else.

78
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,880
Damn it!

79
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
Go.

80
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
Go.

81
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,440
Hey.

82
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,640
Trying to take me down
with cowardly tricks again, Pud?

83
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
You petty bandit.

84
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Splash the black dog's blood on him. Go.

85
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,520
- <i>Ja-tha-ka-sa na-ma-a-u.</i>
- Go.

86
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,160
Yod.

87
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Yam is gone.

88
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
I'd bet anything.
You lost to Khun Yod, didn't you?

89
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,480
You're really asking
to get your ass kicked, aren't you?

90
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,840
Easy, Uncle.

91
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
Over there. Before you kick me, look.

92
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,560
Pae, my dear nephew…

93
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
Wow.

94
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,960
Where did you find these girls?

95
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,800
At the pier behind Khun Yod's house.

96
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,000
And this one tried to run.

97
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
So I hit her once.

98
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,840
Hit her once?

99
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
Hey.

100
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,800
Who the hell are you?

101
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,720
No idea, Uncle.

102
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,960
I saw her at the pier, so I took them all.

103
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
I'm Khun Yod's daughter.

104
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,360
My father will come for me.

105
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,880
You bastards won't die well.

106
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
Khun Yod's daughter?

107
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,480
Then you'll sell

108
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,520
for way more than these ones,
you know that?

109
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Uncle.

110
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Let her go back to her father.

111
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,960
Let her go so I can be stupid?

112
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
- Did you find her?
- I searched everywhere. I didn't find her.

113
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
The women you helped are gone too.

114
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,960
Khun Yod, this way, sir.

115
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
There. Khun Yod.

116
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,040
Yam's lantern.

117
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Or… Bandit Pud took Yam?

118
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,680
Im, stay here. Yiam,

119
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,280
go check the abandoned hut
near the entrance to Tha Khiri town.

120
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm going to storm Bandit Pud's cave.

121
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Yod, will our daughter be alright?

122
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,880
As long as I'm alive,
no one will lay a hand on our daughter.

123
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
Go, Yiam.

124
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,200
Be careful, both of you.

125
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,800
Not here.

126
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,680
Or did they take her
to the brothel in town?

127
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
How far are you? Pound it down. Finer.

128
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,080
Even finer than that.

129
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,600
Add more water to this one.
It's dried out already.

130
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,560
Alright?

131
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah.

132
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,480
<i>Will you wait for me?</i>

133
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,000
I will. I'll wait right here.

134
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Yiwha.

135
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,480
- Yiwha.
- Yes?

136
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
Auntie?

137
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,000
This isn't good.

138
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know how to do it.

139
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,960
If you don't know, then learn.

140
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,400
One day you'll marry,

141
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
and you won't embarrass yourself.

142
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,560
Auntie,

143
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,080
let me go help Lasor
build the pavilion, please.

144
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,200
That's men's work.

145
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,520
Go wherever you want. I'll do it myself.

146
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,520
Well, Yiwha.

147
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
Auntie Phon chased you off again?

148
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm just bad at handiwork.

149
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,600
I'd be better at chopping wood
and splitting firewood.

150
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,080
When are you ever
going to get married off?

151
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,760
Nui!

152
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,720
- Come here.
- Come on. Enough.

153
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm just kidding.

154
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
Anyway, Yiwha,

155
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,480
go buy firecrackers in town for me,

156
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,960
so we can drive off bad things.

157
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,360
Alright.

158
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Alright.

159
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,640
Keep going.

160
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,760
And if something happens to me,

161
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,600
if I never return?

162
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,040
Don't say things like that. It's bad luck.

163
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,520
I heard that

164
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,200
those who study sorcery at Khao Phrom,
if their mind isn't strong,

165
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,160
they either die or go mad.

166
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,440
Take this one and patch it with that.

167
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Here, Lasor.

168
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920
Isn't it too short, Uncle?

169
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,920
If it's not enough, go cut more.

170
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
I'll go myself.

171
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,079
Get me the machete. Come with me.

172
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,040
Hurry up.

173
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,120
Blur.

174
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,360
Orror.

175
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,000
It's the sarong you gave me. Is it pretty?

176
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,280
What's wrong?

177
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,800
My sister is missing.

178
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,560
Missing?

179
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Where did she go?

180
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,040
Last night, Bandit Pud raided my house.

181
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm afraid he took my sister
to sell her to a brothel.

182
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Come on. Let's go help your sister.

183
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,760
Hey!

184
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
You think you can run?

185
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,680
Try it again

186
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,440
and I'll kill all of you.

187
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,160
Go. Get them up.

188
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,680
- Get up!
- Don't try to trick us.

189
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
- Go. Get up.
- Get up.

190
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,240
- Go.
- Walk.

191
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
Come.

192
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,280
Hey.

193
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,240
Go.

194
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,360
- You can go.
- Move.

195
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,720
Wait for me around here.

196
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Aren't you Khun Yod's son?

197
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,040
Here for some fun? First time?

198
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,720
Middle of the day, huh?

199
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
This place is open
day and night, isn't it?

200
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
I can come whenever I want.

201
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,360
Come on in. Plenty to choose from.

202
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
What's your type? Just tell me.

203
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
Have you decided?

204
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,920
Got anyone small, fair-skinned?

205
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,960
New girls would be best.

206
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,400
Follow me.

207
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Hey.

208
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
What are you doing sneaking around here?

209
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Nothing.

210
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,360
Yam.

211
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,280
You want this one?
So you don't waste time.

212
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Hey, take the customer.

213
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I'd rather not.

214
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Did you find her?

215
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,560
Maybe she's somewhere else.

216
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
It's valuable. A good piece.

217
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,800
Did you steal this from someone?

218
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
I don't want stolen goods.

219
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,280
Steal what?

220
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,880
It's my great-grandma's heirloom.

221
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,680
Then what was your great-grandma's name?

222
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,680
Well… Daeng.
My great-grandma's name was Daeng.

223
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,560
Does this say Daeng?

224
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,080
It's Daeng.

225
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,760
Doctor,

226
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,880
can you help me?

227
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,280
What does this bangle say?

228
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
Daeng. I told you it's Daeng.

229
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,840
YAM

230
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,000
Yam.

231
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Where did you get this?

232
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,680
- Go!
- No.

233
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,080
Go.

234
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,360
No!

235
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,200
What's all this noise?
You're scaring the customers.

236
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,040
She refused to take a customer,

237
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,320
so I taught her a lesson.

238
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,720
You can tell by her eyes.

239
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,040
She's stubborn. I'll handle her myself.

240
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,680
I curse you all.
May you never be born again.

241
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
Where do you think you're going?

242
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
Where are you going?

243
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,480
Come here.

244
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,200
Get out.

245
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
I'll handle this one myself.

246
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,760
Do it hard, Uncle.

247
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,640
This room, right?
The one who just arrived?

248
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,840
She's already reserved.

249
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
This is Young Master Rueang,
Tycoon Thongyoo's son.

250
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
He's a regular here.

251
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,960
She's stubborn as hell.
Uncle Pud's teaching her a lesson.

252
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,520
A lesson now?

253
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,480
Her face is bruised.
Who's going to want that?

254
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,640
It's fine.

255
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
The more stubborn, the better.

256
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
A customer?

257
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
If you haven't paid me,
she's not taking any guest yet.

258
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,160
I know. Cheap bastard.

259
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,840
Go wait at the teahouse.

260
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,920
I'll have someone bring the money.

261
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,840
TEA

262
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,560
I'll go in myself.

263
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,960
I'm coming too.

264
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,040
Does it hurt?

265
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Help me. I was kidnapped.

266
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,440
Please get me out of here.

267
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,520
With a face

268
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
and skin like this…

269
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,000
Alright.

270
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,800
If you behave,

271
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,360
I'll pay to take you home.

272
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,160
You'll take me?
I'll live well and eat well, right?

273
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,040
My father's a tycoon.

274
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,840
Whatever you want, I can get it for you.

275
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Then

276
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,960
I'll serve you the best I can.

277
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,680
But can you untie me first?

278
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,040
Don't be stubborn with me.
I'm warning you.

279
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Where are you going?

280
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Come here.

281
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,440
So feisty, huh?

282
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Let go! No!

283
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,840
I said don't be stubborn with me.

284
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,400
No!

285
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
What are you two doing here?

286
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Where's my sister?

287
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,960
How would I know where your sister is?

288
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Get out! I said no!

289
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
Help!

290
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,960
Yam.

291
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,800
Hey.

292
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
I'm taking my sister back.

293
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,840
You want to die here
and haunt this brothel?

294
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,760
I'll do you a favor. Consider it clemency.

295
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,200
Hey.

296
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Go!

297
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,080
Take it off!

298
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,280
It hurts!

299
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
‪Stay away!

300
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,400
Help me…

301
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Wait.

302
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,360
Catch them!

303
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,400
No.

304
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
Wow.

305
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,080
Kill her!

306
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,400
Why won't it fire?

307
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,240
Dad?

308
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,360
Yam's upstairs.

309
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,199
Split up. Search for her.

310
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Hurry, run.

311
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,800
Help me!

312
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,840
Don't!

313
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,920
Dad!

314
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,040
Dad, help me.

315
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,440
Dad…

316
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,680
One more step and she dies.

317
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,520
You hell spawn!

318
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,480
Help me…

319
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Yam!

320
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,200
Yiam…

321
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,360
Follow me.

322
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,840
- Dad, watch out!
- Die!

323
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,160
You!

324
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,280
I won't let you get away.

325
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,480
<i>Tattava Visatchetum Nasasi.</i>

326
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,920
Sir.

327
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,080
Sir.

328
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,640
Help me!

329
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,920
Someone, help!

330
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,920
Get out of here.

331
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,360
Go take care of your sister.

332
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,800
Thank you.

333
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
If Father Wad finds out

334
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,600
you helped set up the ritual pavilion,
he'll be happy for sure.

335
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
I just want him to stop being angry.

336
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,400
When he ignores me,

337
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,600
it hurts worse than being whipped.

338
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,120
Between sorcery and your father,
what would you choose?

339
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,600
Of course, my father.

340
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,240
That's it. That's how it should be.

341
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,720
Yeah. That's how it should be.

342
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,200
Oh, look.

343
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,760
- It's as thick as an arm.
- Let's go.

344
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
What's wrong?

345
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,880
Nui,

346
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,880
did you hear someone laughing?

347
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,840
Probably just the wind.

348
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
- Hey, hey.
- What?

349
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,680
The bamboo was right here.

350
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,680
Wait for me.

351
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
I won't lose to you.

352
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,640
Wait up.

353
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,560
Hey, wait for me.

354
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,280
Lasor.

355
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,360
Are you messing with me?

356
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
Lasor.

357
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,640
Wait.

358
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,480
Lasor.

359
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,080
Lasor.

360
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
We've gone too far now.

361
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,160
This is almost
the Hundred-Year Grave Forest.

362
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,160
Let's go back. Please.

363
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,120
- Go, Nui.
- Lasor.

364
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,600
Wait for me.

365
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,440
Lasor.

366
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,320
I think we should go back.

367
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,680
Let me try again.

368
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,680
What is it?

369
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,760
Blood.

370
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,000
Blood?

371
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,680
Nui, give me the machete.

372
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,960
Wait.

373
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,160
Why are you digging?

374
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,240
Do you remember what Uncle Niem told us

375
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,680
about the Mountain Spirit Grimoire?

376
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,880
<i>They say a powerful sorcerer</i>

377
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,680
<i>once trained his spells on this mountain</i>
<i>until his fire element ruptured,</i>

378
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,600
<i>blood pouring</i>
<i>from all nine bodily orifices and he died.</i>

379
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
<i>Obsessed with the knowledge</i>
<i>he had mastered,</i>

380
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,600
<i>he clutched the grimoire,</i>

381
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,360
<i>even in death.</i>

382
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,920
<i>Later,</i>

383
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,160
<i>bamboo grew</i>
<i>from the ground above his body.</i>

384
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,560
<i>It's believed that if you strike</i>
<i>a bamboo grove and blood flows out,</i>

385
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,680
<i>the Mountain Spirit Grimoire,</i>

386
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
<i>containing forbidden sorcery</i>
<i>lies hidden there.</i>

387
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,800
It's just an old tale.

388
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
It can't be real, right?

389
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,440
Real or not, you'll know.

390
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,400
- Let's go back.
- Whoa.

391
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,880
Don't interrupt.

392
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,400
Ghost!

393
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,680
Let's go back!

394
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,840
Wait.

395
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,840
Huh?

396
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,680
Hey, when are you going to pay me?

397
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,160
Can't I pay later?

398
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,040
I'll pay as soon as I have money.

399
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,520
And when will that be?

400
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,520
Every time you get money,
you lose it all at the gambling den.

401
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,240
I think you'd better pay me now.

402
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,720
I told you, I'm broke.

403
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
Are you deaf?

404
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,520
No payment, then you get hurt.

405
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,480
Alright. I'll pay.

406
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,000
This knife's forged
from real Nam Phi steel.

407
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,680
It's a good blade.
You won't find another like it.

408
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,440
Just take it.

409
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,680
I'll buy it back when I have money.

410
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,720
Just an ordinary knife. What's it worth?

411
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,120
Don't underestimate it.

412
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,360
It's a ritual blade,
enchanted by the Khao Phrom School.

413
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,400
I'll cover your debt.

414
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,280
When you want the knife back,
come find me.

415
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,160
Thank you.

416
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,000
Pae.

417
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,640
Pud!

418
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,240
The brothel's been wrecked.

419
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,760
So what?

420
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,400
Khun Yod used sorcery
to make Duang and Tim

421
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,320
shoot each other.

422
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,960
They're lying in pools of blood.
No one dares go near them.

423
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,640
Now that's interesting.

424
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,280
Slowly.

425
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,640
Who dared shoot you, Father?

426
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,600
Calm down, Miss.

427
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,960
How dare you shoot my father, Tim?

428
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,280
You ungrateful bastard.
You bite the hand that feeds you.

429
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,000
It wasn't me, Miss, please calm down.

430
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,000
It's…

431
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,840
Look. It wasn't his doing.

432
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,080
It was Khun Yod's sorcery
that made the governor and Khun Paeng

433
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,680
shoot each other.

434
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
Who is this Khun Yod?

435
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,320
Khun Yod Pakdee. Yiam's father.

436
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,880
How is my father?

437
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,480
He'll live, but his leg will be crippled.

438
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,840
It'll never be the same.

439
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,760
Khun Yod, you bastard!

440
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,000
I'll cut your head off!

441
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,880
For now, focus on recovering, sir.

442
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,480
Khun Yod won't live much longer.

443
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,600
His fate is already sealed.

444
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,120
No.

445
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,360
No…

446
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,760
Will Yam be alright?

447
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,840
She was terrified.
That's why she has a fever.

448
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,400
It'll take time
before she's herself again.

449
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,920
At least we saved her in time.

450
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,720
Otherwise…

451
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,240
I'd never forgive myself
for the rest of my life.

452
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,600
Help me.

453
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,640
Help me.

454
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
They won't let this end here.

455
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,240
Dear, let's run away.

456
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,040
Mom…

457
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,200
No…

458
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,720
Help me.

459
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,560
Help me.

460
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,400
Where is your brother?

461
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,040
Lasor is in the house.

462
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,080
He hasn't come down yet?
The ritual has already started.

463
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,840
He'll probably come down soon.

464
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,560
Go get him. If Father Wad finds out,
there'll be trouble again.

465
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,240
I…

466
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,160
What now?

467
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,040
Go get your brother, Yiwha.

468
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,320
Yiwha.

469
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
- Yes, Uncle?
- Go get your brother.

470
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,680
The ritual has begun.

471
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,720
Alright.

472
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,960
There's not a single word on it.

473
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,440
<i>Feed it your blood,</i>

474
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,680
<i>and it will reveal the words.</i>

475
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,600
Fine.

476
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,640
I'll believe you one more time.

477
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,520
<i>That's not enough. Give more.</i>

478
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,760
Lasor.

479
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,800
Lasor, the ritual has started.

480
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,720
‪Yeah.

481
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,720
I'll go later.

482
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,880
Why do you look so pale?

483
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,960
- I have a headache.
- Should I boil some medicine for you?

484
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,920
No need.

485
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,120
Rest will do.

486
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,600
Come to the ritual grounds
when you feel better.

487
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,520
Where's Lasor?

488
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,600
Lasor is sick. He's resting at home.

489
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,120
He's pretending
so he won't have to join the ritual.

490
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,920
Dad,

491
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,960
something feels wrong.

492
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,800
How so?

493
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,520
Come to the ritual grounds
when you feel better.

494
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,680
What exactly is Lasor doing?

495
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,720
Nui,

496
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,200
your brother
caused trouble again, didn't he?

497
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,880
No. He didn't do anything.

498
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,920
He just brought back an old grimoire.

499
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,960
What grimoire? From where?

500
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,560
He found it buried
beneath a bamboo grove on the mountain.

501
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,280
Damn it…

502
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,960
Lasor.

503
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,840
- Lasor.
- Dad.

504
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,360
<i>Sabbe deva pisaceva.</i>

505
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,200
<i>I've come to see Bandit Wad.</i>
<i>I have something urgent.</i>

506
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,560
- Kill him!
- <i>Anicca sa na appati.</i>

507
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,920
The new governor
caught Bandit Yai and his men,

508
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,400
and ordered them hanged immediately.

509
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,040
Why so sudden?

510
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,560
The governor of Tha Khiri
won't let my father and me go.

511
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,320
I'll come get you
at the forest edge by the foothills.

512
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Thanks, Wad.

513
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,160
<i>Maybe they've been friends</i>
<i>since their days at Khao Phrom.</i>

514
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,000
<i>I want to learn sorcery with you.</i>

515
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,480
I'll hand you over to the governor.

516
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,080
<i>What happened?</i>

517
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,640
Chum betrayed us. He used
black dog's blood to break the spell.

518
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,200
From this day on,

519
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,760
you and I are finished.

520
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,160
<i>So who did you give your heart to?</i>

521
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,680
<i>Was it that young man who bought you</i>
<i>the human-face bead bracelet?</i>

522
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,800
<i>Why wouldn't I know?</i>

523
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,560
<i>I can tell you're in love.</i>

524
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,920
I'll run away and live with you, Blur.

525
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,360
