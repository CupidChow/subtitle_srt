1
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
That black coral, is it the real thing?

2
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
Of course it is.

3
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,080
I saw you bump into her on purpose
and snatch her necklace.

4
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,520
Thanks for catching the thief for me.

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
Who's that woman?

6
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,640
Is that his wife?

7
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,640
Does this stone have any power?

8
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,440
Do you like it?

9
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,280
I like it so much.

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Do you like the bracelet,
or do you like me?

11
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,800
Then let me walk you home.

12
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,960
<i>Lady Duen.</i>

13
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,600
<i>Pretty face, pretty name.</i>

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,800
<i>That's my type. I like her.</i>

15
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
Sometimes it's not ghosts
or forest spirits.

16
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,280
Those who know sorcery can
conceal themselves, even turn invisible.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,840
Like when the hermit of Koh Kaew Phitsadan
taught Sudsakorn magic.

18
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,800
"Knowing invisibility, endurance,
and clever strategy,

19
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,600
like Sin Samut, brave and fearless."

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,040
Or maybe Orror knows sorcery?

21
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
You're feeling tempted to learn it now?

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
No, Mom.

23
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,160
It feels unsettling, like witchcraft.

24
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,640
I think it's impressive.

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,080
Maybe I should ask Dad
to teach me some sorcery.

26
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Hey…

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,240
There's an old saying,
"When the rice fields are done,

28
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,960
women weave cloth, men forge iron."

29
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
You should practice weaving properly.

30
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,680
Otherwise people will criticize me,
saying I raised my daughter

31
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,040
without teaching her housework at all.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,480
Mom…

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
But I can read.

34
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
Yiam taught me a little,
and I remembered it right away.

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
Look at you.

36
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
You're a woman, Yam.

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
At least try to listen to me sometimes.

38
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,880
But I can read.

39
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Still talking back nonstop.
Just keep weaving.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
Does it look like me?

41
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
It does.

42
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Who bought that for you?

43
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
No one.

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
I bought it myself.

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
Someone bought it for me.

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,240
Who?

47
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't know.

48
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,120
I really don't know.

49
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,400
We just met.
I don't even know his name yet.

50
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,520
You've been sneaking out of the den
because you want to see him, haven't you?

51
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Oh, Uncle…

52
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,120
He's just a stranger
I've met once or twice, that's all.

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,840
Men are hard to trust.

54
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,840
I don't want to see you cry.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,360
I know, Uncle.

56
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
I don't even want to get married.

57
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll just grow old, hanging on
the shelf here in the bandit den.

58
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Keep that bracelet hidden well.

59
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,760
Don't let your father see it.

60
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,280
Otherwise the whole bandit den
will be in chaos.

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Not bad at all, Blur.

62
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,240
You're my first friend.

63
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
Relax, Your Excellency.

64
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
Who are you?

65
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
My name is Pud.

66
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,760
He's a pirate who's been raiding
merchant ships along the Tha Khiri coast.

67
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
What do you want?

68
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,840
I came to discuss

69
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,320
a business opportunity
with Your Excellency.

70
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,720
You think you can do business?

71
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm talking to your master,
not to a lackey.

72
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,040
You think you're tough?

73
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,559
Go on. Let's hear it.

74
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Go first.

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,800
I happen to have young,
beautiful dancers from Pattani

76
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
to offer for sale.

77
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Where's the merchandise?

78
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Tomorrow, I'll deliver them
to the brothel.

79
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,520
But today, I'll need a deposit first.

80
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
Don't trust him, Your Excellency.

81
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,480
This man can't be trusted.

82
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
Peang,

83
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm still more trustworthy
than a bootlicker like you.

84
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,880
You think you're tough?

85
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,080
What do you say, Your Excellency?

86
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,080
If you don't want them,

87
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,400
I'll sell them to another city's brothel.

88
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,040
Tim, go get the money.

89
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,960
Yes, sir.

90
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
Can that governor really be trusted?

91
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't you trust my eyes?

92
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,200
They say
the chicken sees the snake's legs,

93
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,440
and the snake sees the chicken's breasts.

94
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,640
What if he double-crosses us
and sends the police?

95
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,160
Hey, stop being a coward.

96
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,120
If you want to do big things,

97
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,120
you have to dare to take risks.

98
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
Tomorrow,

99
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,640
you'll take these girls

100
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
to the brothel.

101
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,080
You want to be slapped?

102
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Got it.

103
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm going to be rich!

104
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm going to be rich!

105
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,320
Why don't you ask Wad, your father?

106
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,960
About both the things you want to know,
and the things you don't.

107
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,840
If asking him would give me answers,
would I come here?

108
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,680
Did you not get an answer,
or did you refuse to believe

109
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,920
the one you got?

110
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
What are you making?

111
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
Boiled silver barb.

112
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,360
Then I'll come by for dinner later.

113
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
Yiwha.

114
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,720
Yes, Aunt Phon?

115
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
Can you go pick
some torch ginger flowers for me?

116
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
Torch ginger?

117
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,040
What are you cooking, Auntie?

118
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,280
Coconut curry, sour curry,

119
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
or boiled for chili paste?

120
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm thinking of making <i>khao yam.</i>

121
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Orror.

122
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Blur.

123
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,840
Did you see anything?

124
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,760
I just got here.

125
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,760
Where's the bracelet I bought you?

126
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh…

127
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,000
I was afraid I'd lose it,
so I put it away.

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,640
So what are you doing out here?

129
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
I'm looking for herbs.

130
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
And you?

131
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,920
Picking torch ginger.

132
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,600
Me too. Torch ginger.

133
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
Want to go together?

134
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,240
Let's go.

135
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,600
Torch ginger can be used as medicine too?
I didn't know that.

136
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,840
Torch ginger, also called gala,

137
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,840
helps expel wind, treat rashes,

138
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
bloating, indigestion,

139
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,080
skin ailments,
and strengthens the fire element.

140
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,160
You really are smart. A real doctor.

141
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,720
I could never memorize
medical texts like you.

142
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,840
You can do things I can't too.

143
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,960
Like throwing knives.

144
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,080
Who taught you?

145
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,840
My uncle.

146
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,440
I've never seen a girl
throw knives like you.

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
My sister

148
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,280
learns cooking, weaving, garland-making,

149
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,600
household things.

150
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,040
Boring.

151
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
I don't like any of that.

152
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,760
Knife throwing
and sword fighting are better.

153
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you know spells and sorcery too?

154
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,280
Why are you asking?

155
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,720
You fight like the men do.

156
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
I was just curious.

157
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,200
There it is.

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
People say the governor of Tha Khiri

159
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,520
has put a bounty on Yai and Wad,
100 <i>tamlueng</i> each.

160
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,720
Oh? Only that much?

161
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,640
Wad should be worth at least 500.

162
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
Don't joke around.

163
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,280
You should warn Wad

164
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,760
to lie low for a while.

165
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,720
Tell him not to raid anything right now.

166
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Alright. I know.

167
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
And when are you

168
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,000
sending Yiam to Khao Phrom?

169
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,240
Once he's back,
he can help take care of the villagers.

170
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,680
Soon.

171
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,160
Once he returns,
I'll get him married right away.

172
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,200
Then I can finally rest easy.

173
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
Talk to him carefully, Yod.

174
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,200
Chang told me

175
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,000
Yiam already has someone in his heart.

176
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,800
What? Why are you just standing there?

177
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,120
Hurry up,

178
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,360
or I'll take all the pretty ones.

179
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,280
Your father must be very protective,

180
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,840
having such a beautiful daughter.

181
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,480
He's very tough, like a tiger,
especially with his children.

182
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,640
But villagers say he's kind,

183
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
always helping others.

184
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,480
What about your father? Is he strict?

185
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,359
He is.

186
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,359
If he weren't, he couldn't lead anyone.

187
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,480
Don't tell me…

188
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,760
your father is…

189
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
the governor?

190
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,800
My father insists I study at Khao Phrom,

191
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,960
learn sorcery
to protect myself from bandits.

192
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
Tha Khiri is full of bandits,

193
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,960
Bandit Pud, Bandit Yai,

194
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,840
and Bandit Wad.

195
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
There are good bandits too.

196
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Some people didn't choose that life.

197
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,960
They rob people for a living.
How is that good?

198
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,320
You sound like you're one of them.

199
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,320
If I were a bandit,

200
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,040
I'd rob your house first, Blur.

201
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,680
If I graduate from Khao Phrom,
I'll be deal with you first,

202
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Lady Bandit Orror.

203
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,280
Where has everyone gone?

204
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,520
They're never home.

205
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Phon sent Yiwha
to pick torch ginger for cooking.

206
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
Nui,

207
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,920
where's your brother?

208
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,560
I haven't seen him at all.

209
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,360
Take them to the brothel.

210
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,560
And don't steal my money
to gamble or drink again.

211
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah, I know.

212
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,320
Move.

213
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,440
Hey.

214
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,160
I'll kill anyone who resists.

215
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,920
And don't let me hear any gossip about me.

216
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,680
You bastard. You sent me to die.

217
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,040
But you survived.

218
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,000
Where's the Boar King's tusk?

219
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,640
I killed it,

220
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,440
but lost the tusk.

221
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,960
What's so funny?

222
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,360
I eat rice, not grass.

223
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,240
A boar king has two tusks.

224
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,760
Did you lose them both?

225
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,680
One's left.
My father shot the other one away.

226
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
What a waste of treasure.

227
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
Your father really is stupid.

228
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
Don't insult my father.

229
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,600
If you're that stupid, then just die.

230
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,960
Let's see how brave you really are.

231
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
‪Thank you.

232
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,680
"A crow clings to a parasitic vine,
perched on the tumka tree."

233
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
"It drifts and circles,
calling as it flies."

234
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,760
"A flock of crows gathers,
settling together."

235
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,680
"They entwine and cry out,
lost among tangled branches."

236
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,120
Orror,
how many crows do you think there are?

237
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
There's the one that's a bird…

238
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,720
and the one that isn't.

239
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,440
Who would know?

240
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
Two.

241
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,240
A male and a female.

242
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
That's right.

243
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
For you.

244
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,600
Take it, as a symbol of our friendship.

245
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,080
Then…

246
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,640
I'll give you this one too.

247
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,200
Friendship should be shared, right?

248
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,960
When will I see you again?

249
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
If we meet too often,
you'll get bored of me.

250
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,160
I won't. I like being with you.

251
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,600
Tomorrow, I'll wait
where you practice throwing knives.

252
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,360
What bird is that?

253
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,720
Where?

254
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't see anything.

255
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,680
Orror?

256
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
You're spacing out.

257
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,800
You'll slice your hand with that knife.

258
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,920
Aunt Phon, you've lived in Chum Suea
since you were young.

259
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,480
Have you ever felt lonely?

260
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,880
Sometimes. I miss my late husband.

261
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
Why?

262
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,280
When you feel lonely, what do you do?

263
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,720
I cook. I sweep. I mop.

264
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,440
Then it passes.

265
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,800
And you never look for anyone
to keep you company?

266
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
A new husband?

267
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Around here it's all drunken bandits.
I don't want that.

268
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,440
If I don't meet the right one,
I'd rather die a widow.

269
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,040
Then how do you know who the right one is?

270
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,040
You just want to talk to him,
want to be with him,

271
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,120
want to see his face often, I suppose.

272
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
When will I see you again?

273
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
If we meet too often,
you'll get bored of me.

274
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,240
I won't. I like being with you.

275
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,040
If it's right, it's right.
Why are you digging into me?

276
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Just asking, Auntie.

277
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,640
Yiam,

278
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,400
is it pretty?

279
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,080
Wow, did you weave this yourself,
or did Mom help?

280
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
You're really good.

281
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,880
I did it myself.

282
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,560
If I try to sell it,

283
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
I don't know if anyone would buy it.

284
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,520
I'll buy it.

285
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,240
You're the best.

286
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,960
So,

287
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
who are you buying it for?

288
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,640
Is it the person in this picture?

289
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,280
Who is she?

290
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,280
Give it back.

291
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
Oh…

292
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,440
is she your mermaid, Prince Aphai?

293
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
Give it to me.

294
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,360
No.

295
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Mom, Yiam has someone he loves!

296
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,480
Hey.

297
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,080
What are you two doing?

298
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
You're loud enough
for the whole neighborhood.

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
Mom, Yiam has someone he loves!

300
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
- I'm getting a sister-in-law!
- Yam.

301
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
Is it true, Yiam?

302
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
Whose daughter is she?
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,880
- Mom…
- Who is she?

304
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
Yam.

305
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,640
We need to talk.

306
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
Who?

307
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
- What do you mean, who?
- Whoa.

308
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,160
The woman you're seeing, who is she?
What's her name?

309
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,280
Who are her parents? Where does she live?

310
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,280
I don't know.

311
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,440
Yiam!

312
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,920
I said I don't know.

313
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
Everything you asked,

314
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,400
I don't know any of it.

315
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,520
Did you sneak off to the brothels in town?

316
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,360
No, Dad. I didn't.

317
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,080
And she's not some courtesan either.

318
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
You love her, don't you?

319
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,760
Yes.

320
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,720
Forget her.

321
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Pack your things.

322
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,240
In seven days,
I'm taking you to Khao Phrom.

323
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,080
Dad.

324
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Lasor.

325
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,160
Hello.

326
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,080
Hey, don't struggle.

327
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,480
Are you scared?

328
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,400
Uncle Pud said tonight Tim will
send people to pick these girls up.

329
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,520
Keep a close watch.

330
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh? And what about you?

331
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,360
I finally came ashore in Tha Khiri.

332
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,560
I've got to see the world a bit,
haven't I?

333
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm off.

334
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey!

335
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
One of them got away!

336
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,520
You watch them here. I'm going after her.

337
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,560
Last time, with the wild boar,
you might've been lucky.

338
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,320
But this time…

339
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,040
<i>Sa-a-ni-so, sa-a-ni-sang…</i>

340
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>Thu-sa-ni-so, thu-sa-ni-sang…</i>

341
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
Pud! What the hell are you doing?

342
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,560
Hey!

343
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Don't come near me!

344
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
Lasor.

345
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
So you won't say I'm heartless.

346
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,800
Time to show off.

347
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,520
Damn you!

348
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Try to survive.

349
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,480
<i>Namo Buddhaya</i>
<i>Ma-pha-tha-na, pha-ka-sa-ja…</i>

350
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
<i>Ut-thang, at-tho, sa-ra-jit-tang…</i>

351
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
I'll give you one last chance.

352
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,280
Stay away from my son.

353
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,880
Your son's the one
who came to mess with me.

354
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,280
Go back.

355
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,280
If you've got time at home,

356
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,080
teach your kid.

357
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,160
So he won't grow up
to be a bandit like his father.

358
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Go.

359
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,199
Where have you been, Lasor?

360
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,120
Uncle Niem and I searched everywhere.

361
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,719
Did Father hit you?

362
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,719
- Stop.
- Does it hurt?

363
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,840
Tell me who did this to you.

364
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,440
Dad.

365
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,320
Dad, Lasor, perfect timing.

366
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,600
Come taste my torch ginger spicy salad…

367
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,199
What happened to you?

368
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,120
Hey, Lasor, wait for me.

369
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Your brother caused trouble again.

370
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,080
Leave them alone for now.

371
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,280
Since he got back,

372
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,920
Lasor hasn't said a word to anyone.

373
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,040
Brother…

374
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,000
Dad must be really mad at me.

375
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,920
He'll get over it, like every time.

376
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,800
No.

377
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,320
This time it's not like before.

378
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,920
Even my face,

379
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,640
he won't even look at me.

380
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,080
Take your medicine first.

381
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
I boiled gotu kola water for you.

382
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,360
I'm such a pathetic loser.

383
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,880
I never do anything right.

384
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,920
I only cause trouble.

385
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Everyone makes mistakes.

386
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,040
Don't keep torturing yourself
over the past.

387
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,640
We still have tomorrow to start over.

388
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
Please?

389
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,360
Mm.

390
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,080
How the hell did you let her get away?

391
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,760
First job and you already screw it up.

392
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Just like I thought.

393
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,720
I'll chase her down myself.

394
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
When you've got the full set,
bring the goods to me.

395
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,120
Yes.

396
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Move. We're going back.

397
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
- Which way did she run?
- Khuan Phra-ngam.

398
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,400
You and you, come with me.

399
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,120
And you, while I'm away,

400
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,960
watch them.
Don't let anyone slip out again.

401
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,960
Go.

402
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,720
<i>Forget her. Pack your things.</i>

403
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,080
<i>In seven days, I'm taking you</i>
<i>to Khao Phrom.</i>

404
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,320
I'll give you this one too.

405
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
Friendship should be shared, right?

406
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,360
Please let me see you one more time

407
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,560
before we have to part.

408
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,400
Thief?

409
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Hey! What are you doing here?

410
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,920
What's wrong?

411
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,200
I heard a woman scream from over there.

412
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Here's some medicine.

413
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,680
Take it slowly.

414
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,400
Hey, this is Khun Yod's place.

415
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,720
Thank you for saving me.

416
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,080
Eat first. You'll need strength.

417
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,240
Thank you.

418
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,880
So how did you end up here?

419
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,920
Bandit Pud's men kidnapped me.

420
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,800
They were taking us to sell
to a brothel in Tha Khiri, but I escaped.

421
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,440
Stay here until you're well.

422
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,120
Don't be afraid of anything.

423
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,240
I guarantee your safety.

424
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,480
They won't dare
cross into Khuan Phra-ngam.

425
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
My father is the highest authority
in this district.

426
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
If they come, he won't let them live.

427
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,280
Today, don't go anywhere until I'm back.

428
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,640
Take care of your mother and sister.

429
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Dad.

430
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,680
What are you going to do
with the women who are being held?

431
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,480
Everything has its procedures.

432
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,920
I'm the village chief of Khuan Phra-ngam,
not the governor of Tha Khiri.

433
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,160
Outside my district,
I don't want to get involved.

434
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,840
Don't, Uncle, please.

435
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,640
My tooth hurts.

436
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,720
Why are you telling me?

437
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
Why didn't you
chase her down and bring her back?

438
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,680
She ran into Khuan Phra-ngam.

439
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,560
Khun Yod Pakdee's son helped her.
Who would dare go in there?

440
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,280
So you've got good ears,
but you're blind as hell.

441
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,200
That bitch is mine.

442
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,720
I caught her. You saw her run,
why didn't you drag her back?

443
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,080
I didn't dare, Uncle.

444
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,880
If you're not scared,
why don't you go yourself?

445
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,040
Are you talking back to me,
you ungrateful nephew?

446
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,440
No…

447
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,000
So what do we do now, Uncle?

448
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,040
We sell whatever we have.

449
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,600
You take the rest
and deliver them to Tim at the brothel.

450
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,120
I don't want to lose my customer.

451
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Go!

452
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,600
Let's go.

453
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,720
Hit me, Dad.

454
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,120
Just don't act
like you can't see me like this.

455
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,640
Whipping a man like you

456
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,840
would be a waste.

457
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,960
Am I wrong for wanting to be like you?

458
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,440
- So you'd be proud of me for once.
- Don't try to become me.

459
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,240
I just want you to be an ordinary man.

460
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,480
Do you understand?

461
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,000
If I'm just an ordinary man,

462
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,000
- how will I help you protect Chum Suea?
- You don't have to protect anyone.

463
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
Just protect yourself,
so you don't die by spear or blade.

464
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,360
That's enough for me.

465
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,160
Dad,

466
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,080
answer me honestly.

467
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,400
Do you regret having me as your son?

468
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,240
Dad,

469
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,800
please forgive Lasor.

470
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,480
I want bamboo shoot curry
with coconut milk.

471
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,680
Go tell Phon to make it for me.

472
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,600
Yes, Dad.

473
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,040
So you're accusing me
of working with Bandit Pud?

474
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,600
Not at all, sir.

475
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,280
But Bandit Pud has been kidnapping women
to sell to brothels in Tha Khiri.

476
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,680
As the governor,
can you truly stay idle, sir?

477
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,680
Do you have proof

478
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,160
that Bandit Pud
brought kidnapped women into my town?

479
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,080
Or if the woman he caught ran to you,

480
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,680
send her as a witness,

481
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,280
so I can investigate properly
and throw Bandit Pud in jail.

482
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,480
Besides you,
how many more did Bandit Pud kidnap?

483
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,960
Two.

484
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,080
They're at an abandoned hut in Tha Khiri.

485
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,560
The others were all killed.

486
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,200
Well, Khun, do you have any proof?

487
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,720
No, sir.

488
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,400
Oh?

489
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,160
Or do you want His Excellency to send men
to search every brothel in Tha Khiri

490
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,320
before you're satisfied?

491
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,360
No proof, no witness.

492
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,760
Then get the hell out.

493
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,600
Tim,

494
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,520
- see our guest out.
- Yes, sir.

495
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,320
If you're truly certain
Bandit Pud hasn't been selling women

496
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,160
to brothels in Tha Khiri, then fine.

497
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,480
If I uncover where he's holding them,

498
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,160
then I won't have to
waste your time reporting to you again.

499
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,560
I'll take my leave.

500
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,120
Khun Yod is here!

501
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,560
Khun Yod!

502
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm not staying here.

503
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,000
Hurry up. Go.

504
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,400
Go.

505
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,240
That's too much.

506
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,120
He looted my goods and hurt my people.

507
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,000
Khun Yod Pakdee's magic is too powerful.

508
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,560
We can't beat him, Uncle.

509
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,520
Look at us. We're wrecked.

510
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,560
A man like me
won't let anyone disrespect me like this.

511
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,840
Losing your dignity won't kill you,

512
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,840
but if we fight him head-on,
we'll die for real.

513
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,520
Why fight him where he sees you?

514
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,040
Fight him when he doesn't.

515
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,520
Go gather every man we've got.

516
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,560
Tonight, I'm raiding Khun Yod's house.

517
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,720
You stepped on his pride like that.
Bandit Pud won't stay quiet for sure.

518
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,480
Pirates coming ashore,

519
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,840
robbing merchant ships,

520
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,160
abducting people and selling them,
I can't tolerate it.

521
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,320
Then what are you going to do next?

522
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,800
There are women
hiding in our rice barn now.

523
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,360
Let them hide here first.

524
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,040
Once they regain their strength,
we'll send them back home.

525
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,680
Yod,

526
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,400
I'm scared.

527
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,560
I'm afraid Bandit Pud will come here.

528
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,680
Don't be afraid, Im.

529
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,720
I'm here.

530
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,960
Orror.

531
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,360
Blur.

532
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
I thought you wouldn't come.

533
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,200
Of course I came. I had to.

534
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,880
I have something for you.

535
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,120
What is it?

536
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,120
A sarong.

537
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,640
My younger sister wove it herself.

538
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,480
You'll look beautiful wearing it.

539
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,600
I'll hold this for you.

540
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,640
Thank you.

541
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,400
Orror…

542
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,360
In a few days, I'm leaving for Khao Phrom.

543
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,200
Is that so?

544
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,320
Then how many years until you finish?

545
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,800
I don't know.

546
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,400
Maybe one year,

547
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,560
two, three,

548
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,960
or ten, even twenty.

549
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,960
That depends on my intelligence.

550
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,360
You're smart. One year will be enough.

551
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,680
Before I go, may I see you every day?

552
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,600
Alright.

553
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,280
I'll come here every day.

554
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Promise?

555
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,920
Promise.

556
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,160
<i>Will you wait for me?</i>

557
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,840
I will. I'll wait right here.

558
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,880
And if something happens to me,

559
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,720
if I never return?

560
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,400
Don't say things like that. It's bad luck.

561
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,800
I heard that those who study sorcery
at Khao Phrom, if their mind isn't strong,

562
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,520
they either die or go mad.

563
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,880
Just rumors, I think. That's not true.

564
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,800
My father and my uncle
both went to Khao Phrom.

565
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,160
Your father and uncle know sorcery too?

566
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,240
Yeah.

567
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,080
Men learn sorcery to protect themselves.

568
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,040
You're the only one
who doesn't know anything.

569
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,560
Orror,

570
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,320
I want to tell you something.

571
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,200
Go on.

572
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
I love you.

573
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,560
I love you too, Blur.

574
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,480
Blood?

575
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,000
<i>He just brought back an old grimoire.</i>

576
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:13,920
From where?

577
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,160
<i>He found it buried</i>
<i>beneath a bamboo grove on the mountain.</i>

578
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,720
<i>My sister is missing.</i>

579
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,040
Where did she go?

580
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,800
<i>Last night, Bandit Pud raided my house.</i>

581
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,040
As long as I'm alive,
no one will lay a hand on our daughter.

582
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
Go!

583
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,400
Khun Yod, you bastard.

584
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,400
I'll cut your head off.

585
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,360
