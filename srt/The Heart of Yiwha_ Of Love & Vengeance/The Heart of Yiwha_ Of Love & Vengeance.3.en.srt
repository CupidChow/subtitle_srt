1
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,120
<i>Where do you get the nerve</i>
<i>to treat people like that?</i>

2
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
Dad.

3
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,240
If you make a mistake and someone dies,
do you have the means to repay them?

4
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
Didn't I order you

5
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,280
not to get involved with those pirates?

6
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,040
Dad, stop!

7
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,600
The other day I heard you talking to Dad.

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,960
Why is he so afraid of that prophecy?

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,600
What prophecy?

10
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,240
Yiam, I'm in trouble.

11
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
- What happened, Auntie?
- My buffalo is missing.

12
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
Are you done yet?

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,720
<i>I hear people coming. Hurry!</i>

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Hey!

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
- Are you stealing the governor's buffalo?
- Hurry.

16
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,200
<i>A boar tusk. Look at that huge tusk.</i>

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
<i>That must be the Boar King's.</i>

18
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,320
<i>They say the Boar King has crystal tusks</i>
<i>that make one invincible.</i>

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>Lasor must be after them.</i>

20
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,800
Wad, what are you spacing out about?

21
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,320
I've been in here building this fire,
and you didn't notice.

22
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Wad. Niem.

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
Chaem.

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,040
Come sit.

25
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,920
Here,

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,520
sun-dried meat. Your favorite, Chaem.

27
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,560
This batch of liquor's strong.

28
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,800
Still not as good as drinking
back at Chum Suea.

29
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,080
One of these days,
why don't we relive the old times?

30
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,040
What's with that face?
You look like the world owes you merit.

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,840
It's my kids.

32
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Always finding ways to give me a headache.

33
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,840
Then wait until Yod gets here
and complain together.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,040
I'd say he's got it just as bad.

35
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,440
There, speak of the devil.

36
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Just like when we first met, back
when we learned sorcery at Khao Phrom.

37
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,000
Wad and Niem arrived together,

38
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,920
then me,

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,360
and you came last, Yod.

40
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
I haven't even had a sip yet,

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
and you're already rambling
about the good old days, Chaem?

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Thanks, you two, for coming with me.

43
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Yeah, but be careful.

44
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,760
The new governor was staring at you
like he wanted to drink your blood.

45
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Hey, don't forget who my father is.

46
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,440
They wouldn't dare touch me.
Thanks anyway, friends.

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,480
Hey, the other day, I ran into some girl.

48
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,600
I've never seen her before.

49
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,360
I saw her near the northern foothills.

50
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,920
A person or a ghost?
They say that area's the Hidden City.

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,160
A person, obviously. She was still warm.

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,760
Oh… you already touched her?

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
So when's the wedding?
I'll start getting ready.

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
Yeah, when's the wedding?

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,840
Marry your ass.
I don't even know her name yet.

56
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh?

57
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Then why didn't you ask?

58
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,280
Next time I see her, I will.

59
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
You like her already, don't you?

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
Well, you can just leave me here.

61
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,720
Up ahead is already
Khuan Phra-ngam territory.

62
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Alright, alright.

63
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,360
By now, my old man's probably complaining
like a bear robbed of its honey.

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,840
- Alright then. See you, Yiam.
- Go.

65
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,520
Let's go, Chang.

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,120
What is it?

67
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
They call this the sap of death.

68
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
Why is it itching and burning like this?

69
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,560
In a bit it'll turn red.
But once it turns black,

70
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,880
you'll have to cut that arm off.

71
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
There!

72
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
Your arm's already turning red.

73
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,400
That's it, Saeng.
You're losing that arm for sure.

74
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,960
- Help me.
- Hey!

75
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,600
I don't want to lose my arm, Yiam.

76
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,560
Help me.

77
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
Who sent you?

78
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,200
The new governor, right?

79
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,840
Then get ready to be One-Armed Saeng.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,240
Let's go.

81
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Khun Paeng.

82
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Khun Paeng sent me.

83
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,080
Ah. So it was Tim.

84
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,360
I've told you everything.
Please treat my arm.

85
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
Fine.

86
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
But you'll do exactly as I say.

87
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,560
Sure.

88
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,320
I'll do anything.
Whatever you want me to do.

89
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
Bow to that buffalo three times

90
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,280
and shout, "Khun Paeng is corrupt,
stealing villagers' buffalo."

91
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,799
Bow to a buffalo?

92
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,039
No way!

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,360
Your arm's turning black.

94
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
Hey, don't leave yet, Yiam.

95
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,400
Ugh!

96
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,640
Fine, I'll bow.

97
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,520
Khun Paeng is corrupt,
stealing villagers' buffalo.

98
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,600
Louder.

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,680
Khun Paeng is corrupt,
stealing villagers' buffalo.

100
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,920
Bow properly and say it louder.

101
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,520
Khun Paeng is corrupt,
stealing villagers' buffalo!

102
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,080
I've told you everything.
Now please treat my arm.

103
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,560
Get lost.

104
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,560
Pound senna leaves with chalk.
It'll keep your arm from rotting.

105
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,720
But if you're slow,
don't blame me if you lose it.

106
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh, oh.

107
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,600
Hurry up.

108
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Khun Paeng is corrupt.

109
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
Right?

110
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
You and I

111
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
swore brotherhood when we were young.

112
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,040
I still remember,

113
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,880
you once said if I had a daughter
and you had a son,

114
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,320
we'd marry them off,

115
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
bind our families together,
become one and the same.

116
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
I remember.

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
But my son's a good-for-nothing.

118
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,640
You still want him as a son-in-law?

119
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,920
Your son can't be worse than mine.

120
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,160
Mine gives me trouble every single day.

121
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm sending him to study
under Old Master Khrua Phut at Khao Phrom.

122
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,520
Will you send your child too?

123
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
No.

124
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,880
I don't want him learning sorcery.

125
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,440
You send yours.

126
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,360
Once he finishes,

127
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
I'll have him come
and ask for your daughter's hand.

128
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Tonight, Bandit Yai and I

129
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,440
are going to rob Tycoon Thongyoo.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,560
Be careful.

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,760
He's connected to Duang, the new governor.

132
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
If he's rotten, I'll rob him.

133
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,680
I don't care who he belongs to.

134
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
Once I get the goods,
I'll stash them at the old place.

135
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,120
Do me a favor

136
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
and distribute them to the villagers,
like always.

137
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,520
And watch over these two for me. I'm off.

138
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
I sent you to teach him a lesson,

139
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,040
but you ended up getting fooled
by that damn kid.

140
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Whoa.

141
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,480
Sap from a rak tree
won't make your arm fall off.

142
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
By now, the whole of Tha Khiri
must be gossiping

143
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,960
that I'm a corrupt official,
stealing villagers' buffalo.

144
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,320
- Well, it is true, sir.
- True?

145
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Is it?

146
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,720
That father and son…
we can't let them live freely anymore.

147
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,000
I, Bandit Wad,

148
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,720
declare before the gods and King Bali

149
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
that I

150
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,680
harbor no treason against the land.

151
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
But Tycoon Thongyoo

152
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,400
is a corrupt tyrant who oppresses
the villagers beyond measure.

153
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
I will take his wealth

154
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,320
and redistribute it

155
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,040
to the suffering poor.

156
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,720
May the sacred powers of this place

157
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,480
open the way for us.

158
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Yai,

159
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,000
you and the men guard the perimeter.

160
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
The way is open.

161
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Bandits,

162
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,320
attack!

163
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,720
Hey!

164
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,520
Sit down.

165
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,680
Hand over everything you've got.

166
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
One.

167
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,160
I won't give you my wealth,

168
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,920
you evil bandit!

169
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
Two.

170
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,680
You worthless piece of trash.
You've got a death wish.

171
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you even know who I am?

172
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
And do you know who I am?

173
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,120
Do you?

174
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Three.

175
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm scared. I'm scared.

176
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,960
Give me

177
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,360
everything,

178
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,480
and I'll keep quiet

179
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,760
about how Tycoon Thongyoo

180
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,680
pissed himself in fear of Bandit Wad.

181
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
Now!

182
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
You're safe now.

183
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,320
Thank you. Thank you so much.

184
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,440
Go.

185
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,200
Didn't know your house was a brothel.

186
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Bandits, retreat.

187
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,640
You're weak, Lasor.

188
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,760
I won't let you die that easily.

189
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
Lasor, are you awake yet?

190
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,640
What is it, Nui?
You're yelling at the crack of dawn.

191
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,520
You can already get up?

192
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,440
Yeah. I'm fine now.

193
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
Fine?

194
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,400
You were barely alive last night.

195
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,520
How did your wounds disappear?

196
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
Not even a scar.

197
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,160
There's no way they healed this fast.

198
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
Must be Uncle Niem's medicine.

199
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,160
No fever, no wounds.

200
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
What did you do?

201
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
This doesn't feel like a dream.

202
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,760
Your wounds are really gone.

203
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,480
And you know what?
The voice I heard last night

204
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
is the same voice I heard
when I hunted the Boar King.

205
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
When I chanted what he told me to chant,

206
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,800
it felt like it wasn't even me anymore.

207
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,040
I don't know if I killed the Boar King

208
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,440
because of myself, the black coral,

209
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,400
or the chant he gave me.

210
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,400
This doesn't feel right,.
We should tell Father Wad.

211
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,720
No. Sit down.

212
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Don't tell anyone.
Just you and me. Understand?

213
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,720
Why can't we tell anyone?

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
The more people, the more trouble.

215
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
I'll find the answer on my own.

216
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,040
If you can't keep your mouth shut,

217
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,800
I won't tell you anything ever again.
Got it?

218
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,520
Alright.

219
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,200
I won't tell anyone.

220
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,680
But where are you going to find answers
if you don't ask Father Wad?

221
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,840
Sir.

222
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,920
This way, sir.

223
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,320
Keep your mouth shut.

224
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,120
Yes, sir.

225
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,480
Store everything under the house.

226
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Did you buy out Chin Yuan's shop to give
everything away to the villagers again?

227
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,800
Dad…

228
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sorry.

229
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,840
I know I was wrong.
Please don't be angry anymore.

230
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,920
If you know you were wrong,
then don't do it again.

231
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,200
I don't want to see you
kill someone out of ignorance.

232
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,320
Khuan Phra-ngam

233
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,040
lies north of Tha Khiri.

234
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
It is geographically diverse,

235
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,920
hills, fields, and sea.

236
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Every route has bandit dens.

237
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,560
At least Khuan Phra-ngam has none.

238
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,640
Anyway,

239
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,560
where is the famous Bandit Wad's den?

240
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,320
I don't know.

241
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,960
Catching bandits

242
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,080
is the police's job.

243
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,600
Even if I become village chief,
I can't protect everyone.

244
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
I can barely protect myself.

245
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,320
That's why I want you
to study sorcery at Khao Phrom.

246
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,280
You'll have spells to protect yourself

247
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,680
and help those who can't fight back.

248
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Promise me,

249
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
so I can die in peace.

250
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,760
Don't say that, Dad.

251
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,440
How could Khuan Phra-ngam
survive without you?

252
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,960
Dad, Lasor and I know

253
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,880
about Grandma Chi Pa Khao's prophecy now.

254
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
Who told you?

255
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
I did.

256
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,040
I swear

257
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
I'll do everything in my power
to prevent that prophecy from coming true.

258
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,040
I swear as well.

259
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,360
I'll do everything
to stop it from becoming real.

260
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,840
From this day forward,

261
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,200
if I betray my word,

262
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,960
may I meet ruin and death

263
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,600
- by blade and spear.
- Lasor!

264
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
Who allowed you to swear a bandit's oath?

265
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm a bandit's son. I swear like a bandit.

266
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,640
You want to be a bandit that badly?

267
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,240
Where did your wounds go?

268
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,800
What did you do?

269
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,080
The power of that black coral
you crushed under your foot.

270
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
Don't let me find out

271
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,640
you got involved with the pirates again.

272
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,480
You fought with your dad again,
didn't you?

273
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,240
I want to be a great bandit like him.

274
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,880
Why can't he understand me?

275
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
What kind of father
wants his kid to be a bandit?

276
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,120
I've never seen a bandit die well,
not even one.

277
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,480
Nui.

278
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,960
Cast the spell, hold your breath,
and stab it in the throat.

279
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,080
This is sacred black coral.

280
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,800
It grants invulnerability and protection.

281
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,160
So who was it that helped me?

282
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,480
What are you mumbling about?

283
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Nui.

284
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,720
You're coming with me.

285
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Uncle Pud isn't here.

286
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,280
Where'd he go?

287
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,840
Robbing.

288
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,400
When's he back?

289
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,880
How the hell would I know?
Say what you need to say.

290
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,840
I've got something to ask you.

291
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,000
What is it?

292
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,960
That black coral Bandit Pud gave me,

293
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
is it the real thing?

294
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Of course it is.

295
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,600
But when I say real,
I mean it's a real rock.

296
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,640
If you're asking whether it's sacred,
I don't know.

297
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,840
Hey!

298
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Brother.

299
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,000
This is their turf. Don't start a fight.

300
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,040
Let's go.

301
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Let go of me.

302
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,360
Move. Go.

303
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,520
Keep walking.

304
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,360
Sit down.

305
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,720
Annoying as hell.

306
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,600
Shut up.

307
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,640
Why bring these women back this time?

308
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,120
Look.

309
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Look at their faces.

310
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,640
Being rich doesn't mean
you get to sleep with women like this.

311
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,760
Ever since Duang became the new governor,

312
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,400
I've seen a lot more ways to make money.

313
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
Are you going to enter government service?

314
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm selling them to a brothel, you idiot.

315
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,400
Your Excellency, help me.

316
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,880
Bandit Yai and Bandit Wad joined forces
and robbed my house last night.

317
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,920
At least no one died.

318
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,520
You've got plenty of money anyway.

319
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,840
Let them take some.
Consider it sharing the wealth.

320
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
Whoa.

321
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,120
If you say that,
what's the point of having a governor?

322
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,640
Watch your mouth.

323
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,400
I've got a lot of work.

324
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,240
If you want my help,

325
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,000
there needs to be a little tea money.

326
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,880
Think about it.

327
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,920
If Bandit Yai and Bandit Wad
come back and rob you again,

328
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,400
next time

329
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
you'll be wiped out.

330
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,200
Fine.

331
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,120
If Your Excellency gets rid of
Bandit Yai and Bandit Wad,

332
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll give you Bird's Nest Island

333
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,400
at Laem Ratu. How about that?

334
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,840
Now that sounds better.

335
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,160
Come on.

336
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,280
You must be thirsty.

337
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,640
Thank you.

338
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,480
Be careful.

339
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,040
- Alright.
- Be careful.

340
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes.

341
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,520
Where did you get the money
to buy all this and donate it?

342
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,320
A friend's treasure from my youth.

343
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,000
Then he must be a rich tycoon.

344
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,240
That's why he has so much money.

345
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,960
You should introduce me.

346
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,880
Maybe he has connections to help me
get into medical training in the capital.

347
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,720
When are you going to stop
wanting to be a doctor?

348
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,640
And when are you going to stop wanting me
to become village chief after you?

349
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,600
Hey, this boy.

350
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,600
You two,

351
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
in a temple of all places,
and you're still arguing?

352
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,920
Yiam, go buy palm sugar
at the market for me.

353
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,120
I'm going to make <i>kanom kho</i> for the monks.

354
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,280
Yes, Mom.

355
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,880
Absolutely hopeless.

356
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,280
Let him be.

357
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,600
Yiam wants to be a doctor. Don't stop him.

358
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,360
Healing people

359
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,080
brings more merit
than building a seven-tiered pagoda.

360
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,400
Last night, they robbed Thongyoo's house.

361
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,280
I hear they got a lot.

362
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,160
I want Dad to stop being a bandit,
robbing people.

363
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,760
What are you saying?
If he hears you, he'll scold you.

364
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,800
Why don't we make an honest living
like everyone else?

365
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,840
Farming, fishing, trading…

366
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,840
I used to think that too.

367
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,040
Then why did you change your mind?

368
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,920
When I was young, pirates robbed me.

369
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,560
My husband was killed,

370
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,400
so I became a widow.

371
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,480
They were going to gang-rape me,

372
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,760
but the chief came and saved me.

373
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,760
That's why he brought me to live here.

374
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
Really, Auntie?

375
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,320
This world is harsher
than you think, Yiwha.

376
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,760
If we don't rob them, they'll rob us.

377
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,320
The chief may be a bandit,

378
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,520
but he chooses to rob the rich

379
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,920
and help the poor.

380
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,920
In all my life,

381
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,920
I've never seen anyone

382
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,400
with a heart as noble as your father's.

383
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,040
Aunt Phon,

384
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,000
I heard there's a traveling troupe
performing near the temple in town.

385
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,440
I've never seen one in my life.

386
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
Please let me go today.

387
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,800
Don't tell Uncle Niem or Dad, okay?

388
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,760
Then hurry back.

389
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,280
Yes.

390
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,639
Mun, didn't you say
there'd be a traveling troupe here?

391
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,800
I don't see anything interesting at all.

392
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,679
There are so many strange things here
they don't sell in the capital. Look.

393
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,840
Backwater wilderness. If I'd known,
I wouldn't have followed Father here.

394
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,159
Oh, there's a fabric stall over there.
Let's go.

395
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,040
- Ouch!
- Hey!

396
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,360
How are you walking, you idiot?
Apologize to her.

397
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,679
Why are you grabbing me? Let go!

398
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,159
Give it back.

399
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,400
What are you talking about?

400
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,680
I saw you bump into her on purpose
and snatch her bracelet.

401
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,840
That's my bracelet.

402
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,880
Give it back!

403
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,720
Stealing from the governor's daughter?
You're asking for death.

404
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,280
Whoa!

405
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
Mun.

406
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,800
- We got it back. Let it go.
- Alright, Miss.

407
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
Here it is.

408
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,280
Thanks for catching the thief for me.

409
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,720
Mun, call him back. I want to reward him.

410
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,120
His name is Yiam. He's the son
of Khun Yod Pakdee of Khuan Phra-ngam.

411
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,840
He's the one
who caused trouble with the governor.

412
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,760
Please don't get involved with him.

413
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,120
I don't care. That's an order.
Why are you still standing there? Go.

414
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Yes, Miss.

415
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Yeah!

416
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
Whoa!

417
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,640
Come on.

418
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,040
Yeah!

419
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,280
So satisfying.

420
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,880
Nice.

421
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,760
Alright! Step right up! Step right up!

422
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,280
Just one <i>att.</i>

423
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,800
Oh?

424
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,960
Hit the target three times
and you win 20 <i>tamlueng.</i>

425
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,400
Wow.

426
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,320
Go, go.

427
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,720
- Hit the target.
- Three shots.

428
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,280
- Go.
- I'll hit it.

429
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,600
Alright, let's go.

430
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
Yeah.

431
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,360
Come on. Hit the target.

432
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,720
Yeah!

433
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
Stop it!

434
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,080
He's human too. How can you be so cruel?

435
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,480
Whoa.

436
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
There goes the fun.

437
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
He's my slave.
I can do whatever I want to him.

438
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,800
If I want to buy his freedom,
what do I have to do?

439
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,520
I bought him for 14 <i>tamlueng.</i>

440
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,520
If you want to redeem him,
bring me 20 <i>tamlueng.</i>

441
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,520
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

442
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Do you have it?

443
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,040
Do you?

444
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,880
Then let's bet. If I shoot the <i>pang-nu</i>
three times without missing,

445
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,520
you let me redeem him.

446
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,520
Whoa.

447
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,760
Why would I bet with you?

448
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,360
A tiny woman like her?
How could she hit three shots?

449
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,640
Just take the bet.

450
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,720
We'll get to watch something fun, right?

451
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,880
Yeah!

452
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,400
That's right!

453
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,280
Hey, stop!

454
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,880
Fine.

455
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,680
Shooting a <i>pang-nu</i> is too easy.

456
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,320
I challenge you to throw knives instead.

457
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,600
Oh.

458
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,640
If you even scratch my slave,

459
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,440
you pay me ten <i>tamlueng</i> per wound.

460
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,760
Oh.

461
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,800
And if he dies, you pay 50 <i>tamlueng.</i>

462
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,320
Oh.

463
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,760
Fifty?

464
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,000
Does she even have that much?

465
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you sure?
I don't have enough money to pay for you.

466
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
Deal.

467
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,520
Wow.

468
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,680
Alright. Who's betting on which side?

469
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,600
Alright.

470
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,840
I'm betting on the girl.

471
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,640
- Come on.
- Me too. I'm betting on the girl.

472
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,480
I'm betting on the merchant.

473
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,360
- Alright.
- Come on.

474
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,040
Let's bet.

475
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,640
Mun, go bring Khun Yod's son to me.

476
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
Tell him I want to talk.

477
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,360
Is that really a good idea, Miss?

478
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,320
Hey. Go.

479
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,040
Please make way.

480
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm betting on the girl.

481
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm betting on the merchant.

482
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,200
Miss Duen, the governor's daughter,
wants to speak with you.

483
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,880
- Speak to me about what?
- Go to her and you'll find out.

484
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,840
Get your money ready to pay me.

485
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,040
Here.

486
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,480
Let's begin.

487
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,400
Amazing!

488
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,840
Wow.

489
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,760
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

490
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,080
So good.

491
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,840
- Amazing.
- Great.

492
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
It's not over yet.

493
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,920
Come on!

494
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,440
Go, girl!

495
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,240
Let's do it!

496
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,400
Last one.

497
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm still alive…

498
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,280
We won!

499
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Come on!

500
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,800
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

501
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,960
Cheater!

502
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,040
You're the cheater.

503
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,560
You two know each other.
You teamed up to scam me.

504
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Who's scamming who?
There are witnesses everywhere.

505
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,000
- Yes.
- That's right!

506
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,480
- Yes.
- Cheater!

507
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,880
Cheater!

508
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,120
Alright, alright. I give up.
Take him. Take him.

509
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Wait.

510
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,680
Hand over the contract too.

511
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,200
The slave sale contract.

512
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,040
I don't have it.

513
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,280
There it is.

514
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,680
Then what's this?

515
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,920
Yeah.

516
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,640
- Hey.
- He's got it!

517
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,920
Hey. That's it.

518
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,880
Yeah, that's it.

519
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,240
Cheater!

520
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,160
Cheater!

521
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
- Ugh!
- Cheater!

522
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,480
- Go!
- Cheater!

523
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,880
Cheater!

524
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,120
Cheater!

525
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,880
Cheater!

526
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,760
- Cheater!
- Who's that woman?

527
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,480
- Is that his wife?
- Which one, Miss?

528
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,680
You're useless at everything.

529
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,440
I never thought

530
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,320
a slave like me would ever be free.

531
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,280
Thank you.

532
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,880
Where will you go now?

533
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,600
I sold myself into slavery
to earn money to treat my mother.

534
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,560
I'll go back and take care of her.

535
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,880
This is the money from the betting.

536
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,160
Use it to buy medicine for your mother.

537
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,320
Save the rest for emergencies.

538
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,960
Thank you.

539
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,320
Here.

540
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,360
Then I'll take my leave, my benefactors.

541
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,400
Thanks, Blur, for helping me.

542
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,640
Can you turn that thanks
into coming to the market with me instead,

543
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,240
Orror?

544
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,680
Venerable sir, does this stone

545
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,720
have any power?

546
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,800
Why don't you ask Wad, your father?

547
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,440
About both the things you want to know
and the things you don't.

548
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,320
If asking him would give me answers,
would I come here?

549
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,600
Did you not get an answer,

550
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,840
or did you refuse to believe
the one you got?

551
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,920
Dad!

552
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,880
- Dad!
- How the hell is a piece of scrap stone

553
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,880
supposed to protect you?

554
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,600
One step,
and I could crush it under my foot.

555
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,920
Lasor, why don't you ask him
about that other thing?

556
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,000
- Venerable sir.
- Hey.

557
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,560
Lasor has been hearing strange voices

558
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,760
and seeing shadows flash past.

559
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,680
What is it really?

560
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,720
A ghost, or a deity?

561
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,640
All defilements perceived through the eye,

562
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,320
ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind

563
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,120
arise from fabricated thought.

564
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,680
When fabrication ceases,

565
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,120
you move that far away from devils.

566
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,760
What does that mean?

567
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,720
You're dodging the question.

568
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,440
I'll take my leave.

569
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,760
Let's go.

570
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,520
Brother.

571
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,800
Alas…

572
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,480
We searched everywhere. They vanished.

573
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,160
Do you think those two
are husband and wife?

574
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,360
I don't care whose husband he is.

575
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,800
If I want him, I'll take him.

576
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,400
Let's see who he chooses,
that wild village girl

577
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,680
or me, the governor's daughter.

578
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,320
If it were you, who would you choose?

579
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
If it were me, I'd choose that woman.

580
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,080
Hey, Duangjai. Are you my sister or not?

581
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,840
Why are you staring at me? Move.

582
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,080
I said move.

583
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
You peasants.

584
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,520
Beautiful like an angel.

585
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,240
If you keep behaving improperly
toward the governor's daughter,

586
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,000
you'll be whipped
until your back splits open.

587
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,480
Wow.

588
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,320
Do you like it?

589
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,520
This one's so cute.

590
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,960
Those are human-face beads.

591
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,520
They just came in, only one piece.

592
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,680
- Human-face beads?
- Yes.

593
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,800
Does it look like me?

594
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,120
It does.

595
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,680
We'll take this one.

596
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,080
You're buying it for me?

597
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,440
No, I can't. I'd feel bad.

598
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,640
If he's buying it for you, just accept it.

599
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,840
May you love each other for a long time.

600
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,080
Here, let me help.

601
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,200
Look.

602
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,120
It's funny. It really does look like you.

603
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,520
Do you like it?

604
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,640
I like it so much.

605
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,880
Thank you.

606
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,800
Do you like the bracelet…

607
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,960
or do you like me?

608
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,080
Blur!

609
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,440
Orror.

610
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,040
Blur, Blur, Blur!

611
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,000
Orror, Orror, Orror!

612
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,280
- Blur!
- Orror!

613
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,120
Will you tell me your real name now?

614
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,560
In your dreams, Blur.

615
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,400
Then I'll call you Orror too.

616
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,560
- Hey!
- Caterpillar.

617
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,080
Don't touch it.

618
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,920
Orror.

619
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,840
How is it? Does it sting or burn?

620
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,680
A little.

621
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,480
Wait here. Sit down. I'll be right back.

622
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,800
I got betel leaves and white liquor.

623
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,080
It'll sting a bit.

624
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,880
There are hundreds of herbs.

625
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,480
You really remember what treats what?

626
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,680
I do.

627
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,680
Maybe because I want to be a doctor.

628
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,040
I can read medical texts all day
and night without getting bored.

629
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,400
You like medical texts

630
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,720
the way I like throwing knives.

631
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,600
Do you come into town often?

632
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,680
No. My father doesn't like me going out.

633
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,520
Then next time,
I'll visit you at your house.

634
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,120
Then my father would probably
blow your head off with a shotgun.

635
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,000
What's wrong?

636
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,720
Let's go back.

637
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,200
If you want to go, go.

638
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,640
I'm staying to wait for my angel.

639
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,560
Stop dreaming. She's the governor
of Tha Khiri's daughter.

640
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,440
And who are you?

641
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,840
Oh right, a bandit's son.

642
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,760
Where is he?

643
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,280
Right here.

644
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,280
You bastard! You filthy piece of trash!

645
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,520
How dare you touch me, you dog!

646
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,160
Calm down, Duen.

647
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,040
Mun, take him back to the residence.

648
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,160
I'll have my father whip him
with a stingray tail soaked in piss.

649
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,920
Yes, Miss.

650
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,080
- Hey!
- Let go of my brother!

651
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,200
Get away!

652
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,600
Hey!

653
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,320
Get away!

654
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,960
What's going on?

655
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,120
It's this young man, Venerable sir.

656
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,560
He molested Lady Duen,
the governor's daughter.

657
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,960
This is temple ground.

658
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,000
I ask that you let it go.

659
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,320
Mun, we're leaving.

660
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,960
That was close.

661
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,320
Good thing
Venerable Father Chan stepped in.

662
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,000
Lady Duen.

663
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,480
Pretty face, pretty name.

664
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,760
But her mouth's sharp. She spits fire.

665
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,840
That's my type. I like her.

666
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,120
You're strange. Men usually like
women who are sweet and gentle,

667
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,840
all soft-spoken and polite.

668
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,440
One day, Nui,
I'll pluck that flower from the sky

669
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,000
and make Lady Duen my wife.

670
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,880
Scrub harder, Duangjai.
Wash the bad luck off me.

671
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,560
You're being too harsh.
I didn't even see him do anything to you.

672
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,000
Not harsh enough.
Did you see the way he looked at me?

673
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,160
That was worse than a dog in heat.

674
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,200
Maybe he likes you.

675
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,800
But I hate him.

676
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,640
He disgusts me.

677
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,440
Who is he? And who am I?

678
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,440
He should look at himself
and know his place.

679
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,120
The only man worthy of me
is just one person.

680
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,720
You said your house
is behind that mountain, right?

681
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,080
Then that place must be a hidden city,
a vanished city.

682
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,880
That's nonsense.

683
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,360
I've lived around here my whole life.
I've never heard of that.

684
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,320
Then let me walk you home.

685
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,320
Stop trying. I'm not letting you.

686
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,080
You can see me off here.
I'm leaving, Blur.

687
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
‪What are you going to do
‪with the women who are being held?

688
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,320
<i>‪Khun Yod's magic is too powerful.</i>
<i>‪We can't beat him, Uncle.</i>

689
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,000
‪A man like me
‪won't let anyone disrespect me like this.

690
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,480
<i>‪Do you know spells and sorcery too?</i>

691
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,840
‪Why are you asking?

692
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,760
<i>‪You don't have to protect anyone.</i>

693
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,160
‪Just protect yourself,
‪so you don't die by spear or blade.

694
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,440
‪That's enough for me.

695
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,200
<i>‪You're my first friend.</i>

696
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,960
‪Once he returns,
‪I'll get him married right away.

697
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,120
‪Chang told me
‪Yiam already has someone in his heart.

698
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,000
<i>‪Then how do you know who the right one is?</i>

699
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,800
<i>‪You just want to talk to him,</i>
<i>‪want to see his face often, I suppose.</i>

700
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,040
‪-I want to tell you something.
‪-Go on.

701
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,880
‪I love you.

702
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,440
