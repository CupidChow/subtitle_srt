5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,480
Wow, cool!

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,800
Cool! That's amazing!

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,080
Wow! It's really cool!

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,850
Hyung, can you let me try it once?

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,090
Just once. Please let me try it once.

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,710
- Hyung, if it falls there, it's not good, right?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,900
It's dangerous there. What are you going to do?

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,380
The lady that lives in that house is scary.

13
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,080
Hey, you—

14
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,460
I don't really remember what happened that day,

15
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,300
but I vividly recollect the face of Seon Mi, who came to help me that day.

16
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,910
God. As a child, I was a coward,

17
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,920
but Seon Mi was very brave.

18
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,500
You were the brave one, Oppa.

19
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,840
You were nice to me when no one would talk to me.

20
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,740
This is such a beautiful connection.

21
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,850
I feel so proud of myself for setting up this opportunity.

22
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,160
In a nice atmosphere such as this, what do you think about having wine?

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm in. That sounds good.

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,460
Secretary Ma.

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,220
Wine will be difficult.

26
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,960
- Why?
- The Great Sage has broken all the wine glasses.

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,160
That thug...

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,210
Ah, please wait just a moment.

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,280
He broke just the wine glasses, right?

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,980
He broke every single glass there is.

31
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,210
Thug.

32
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,690
You better not have a good time.

33
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,060
Have a boring time, then leave quietly and quickly.

34
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,030
Jerk.

35
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,370
Seon Mi, I'm amazed to meet you again.

36
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,750
This moment, right now.

37
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,590
It's like a movie.

38
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,200
You used to like movies, right? You used to talk to me a lot about movies.

39
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,740
The movie I'm making this time... it's about you.

40
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,550
- It's your story.
- My story?

41
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah.

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,800
It's like a fairy tale about a brave country girl who has mysterious abilities.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,430
If it's my story, then it's closer to horror than a fairy tale.

44
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,200
No, no, no, no, no, no. In my memories, it's a fairy tale.

45
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,710
You always believed in and waited for the Fairy.

46
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,970
You said the Fairy would appear and save you when you were scared and in difficult times.

47
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,180
I did. The Fairy.

48
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,820
Did that Fairy appear?

49
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,560
He did appear.

50
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,500
But my fairy does not belong in a beautiful fairy tale.

51
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,780
I heard that Sam Jang is meeting with another man.

52
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,150
Secretary Ma says that the Great Sage is dangerous, so he needs to be watched carefully.

53
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,430
Why is he smiling? It's scary.

54
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,470
Go ask him.

55
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,710
Romantic relationships are your area of expertise, Jeo Pal Gye.

56
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,560
If I went next to him in this atmosphere I will become flattened. I have no intentions of becoming boiled, flattened pork.

57
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,630
If I get involved in his rage, I will at the very least become sweet and sour pork.

58
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,830
It seems that we analyzed the Great Sage's emotion to be more sophisticated than it is.

59
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,600
Right now, that person is deep in a one-dimensional happiness.

60
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,090
A one-dimensional happiness? Because of what?

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,930
Isn't that what Secretary Ma said?

62
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,400
He kissed Seon Mi and threw a big fit before leaving.

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,510
So you're saying he's like that right now because he's happy about the kiss?

64
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,390
Wow, that monkey was an idiot?

65
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,300
I suddenly feel embarrassed that we were worried.

66
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,430
Geez.

67
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,040
- Hyungnim, aren't you worried?
- Why? Worry about what?

68
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,190
Sam Jang is meeting another man.

69
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,080
Sheesh, I don't need to worry. Sam Jang would never betray me.

70
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,090
We made a promise that if she betrays me, I could stab her to death with a knife.

71
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,100
As long as I don't see it with my own two eyes and feel bad about it, it's fine.

72
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,320
People's emotions are not that simple.

73
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,090
I mean, the oppa whose first love is Sam Jang has appeared. How do you think she feels?

74
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,920
How would I know that? Those are her feelings.

75
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,800
You should look closely.

76
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,820
I heard that man is a really good guy.

77
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,490
What if she falls for him while she's with him?

78
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,460
Anyway, she can't make it obvious if she doesn't want to die.

79
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,910
Yes, yes.

80
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,970
If she doesn't want to die at the hands of the Great Sage,

81
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,350
she'll have to restrain herself no matter how much she likes that oppa.

82
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,330
As long as she doesn't show it, right? I get it. I do.

83
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,670
Oh my, it's fire.

84
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,760
Don't you see he's boiling now? Get out quickly before you become sweet and sour pork.

85
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Okay.

86
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,160
Her starting to like him makes me feel very terrible.

87
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,370
This time together was very worthwhile, Jonathan.

88
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,090
Please take Jin Seon Mi safely back to her place.

89
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,750
Of course.

90
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,590
Seon Mi, shall we?

91
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,300
You go ahead.

92
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,400
I think I have someone to meet here before leaving.

93
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,250
Who is it?

94
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,100
The Fairy.

95
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,660
My Fairy has a nasty temper, so I think I need to see him and placate him.

96
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,790
Please get home safely.

97
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,400
Alright.

98
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,250
See you later.

99
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,990
Ah, yes.

100
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,750
Thank you for having me.

101
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,850
Thank you for inviting me today.

102
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,420
Thanks to you, I found a precious connection from my childhood.

103
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,440
I will be rooting for that connection to continue.

104
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,920
I'm asking since you said that you will be rooting for us.

105
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,240
By chance, do you know Seon Mi's fairy?

106
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,930
The Fairy, you say? I'm not sure.

107
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,300
Seon Mi was always waiting for the Fairy.

108
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,330
I thought it was just an imaginary being,

109
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,230
but it must have been a real person.

110
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,890
Well, we'll say that he's a fairy, so that you aren't taken aback,

111
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:48,330
but the thing is, a fairy's work is to help her meet the prince.

112
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,900
Read the fairy tales correctly.

113
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,860
A fairy gets lost when she meets the prince.

114
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,290
Right. I should read fairy tales correctly again.

115
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,960
- Thank you.
- It was fun.

116
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,670
Good bye.

117
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,060
Did you have fun today?

118
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,100
Yes, I guess.

119
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,270
The two of you suit each other well. I hope it works out well.

120
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,740
No way... Are you being caring towards me, Secretary Ma?

121
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,220
No way. It's what Ma Wang wants.

122
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,530
I have no thoughts on it whatsoever.

123
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,350
But I didn't know that Ma Wang would really introduce me to a human man.

124
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,870
The meeting was set up with great care.

125
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,060
You should have left with him and enjoyed your time together some more.

126
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,000
If I enjoy myself, I think he will act up more.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,220
It seems that the Great Sage ruined everything.

128
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,310
Where did he go after ruining a good moment for me?

129
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,300
I missed you.

130
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm not taking Son Oh Gong with me.

131
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,600
Last time when we went into the portrait,

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,820
you locked up our Oh Gong in there.

133
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,730
There is no time. We must hurry.

134
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,270
You must be in a hurry because of the movie you're supposed to watch out there.

135
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,190
Why did you do that?

136
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,370
Because you wished to get rid of me?

137
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,190
My fairy has a nasty temper, so I think I need to see him and placate him.

138
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:22,050
She's going to be easily fooled again by the Fairy.

139
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,280
I'll have to show her those.

140
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,600
You are finished now.

141
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,370
There's no forgiving, or mercy either.

142
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,680
You were left here to watch over Sam Jang.

143
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,420
Yet you didn't even know a man like that was sticking around right next to her?

144
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,110
You failed in your duty!

145
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,090
Now you are going to disappear without a trace and go back into non-existence.

146
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,090
What are you doing here?

147
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,310
What would I do? I was just sitting here.

148
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,180
It seemed like you were talking to someone.

149
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,370
No one's here.

150
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,780
Why is he over there?

151
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,050
Oh. I was going to throw him away because he's useless.

152
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,980
Why would you throw my things away as you please?

153
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,540
Oh, it hurts.

154
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,080
You don't look like you're in a good mood. I guess you didn't have a good time.

155
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,480
It was a meaningful time. I gained a great deal of enlightenment.

156
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,680
Yes, well, you shouldn't meet another human after placing the Geumganggo on me.

157
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,770
I'm glad you realized at least now. You need to have a conscience.

158
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:58,750
Oh, so you, Mr. Fairy, prepared such delicious seasonings because of your tremendous conscience?

159
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,630
- Seasoning?
- I saw it your house. Mr. Fairy's secret seasonings.

160
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,290
They are seasonings that Son Oh Gong made

161
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,580
by boiling it with care for three nights and four days.

162
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,620
These seasoning are... really (to eat me)?

163
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,960
No way.

164
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,040
Like this.

165
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,700
Like this.

166
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,500
He intended to season you up and eat you just like that.

167
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,410
Correct. I made those seasonings.

168
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,730
But why are you criticizing them?

169
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,010
Because you intended to use them when you eat me up.

170
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,240
Why are you so selfish? Why do you only think about yourself?

171
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,380
I put so much effort into making the seasoning, yet I didn't eat you up.

172
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,550
Then you should be thankful to me! Why are you getting so angry?

173
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,440
For a second, I almost said sorry and thank you.

174
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,540
Nevermind. I'm not in love with you in order to hear empty pleasantries.

175
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,610
I'll let it pass.

176
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,200
Pass? Pass on what?

177
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,760
All right. At this point I'm not going quibble over why you made those seasonings.

178
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,320
- But then why didn't you throw them away?
- Why would I? You can't be wasteful if you want to live well.

179
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,100
You're saving them to use later?

180
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,850
You're going to eat me up when the Geumganggo is removed?

181
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,040
Stop saying those kinds of things. Do you know how sad it makes me to think about stuff like that?

182
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,850
Didn't Ma Wang also tell you that I was crying while holding the seasonings?!

183
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,460
He didn't, huh? Always leaving out the important parts, that darned bull.

184
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,100
Why are you blaming Ma Wang here?

185
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,400
I understand. I'll forgive both you and Ma Wang.

186
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,860
Never mind. Let's not talk about it anymore! It's done. Over.

187
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,220
Fine. You didn't have a good time because you spent it thinking about me, right?

188
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,620
Then, from now on I will make it fun for you.

189
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,750
I didn't think about you.

190
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,250
I had a fun time.

191
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,540
If I just hadn't found out about the seasonings, it would have been a great time.

192
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,250
Don't lie. You were bothered while thinking about it.

193
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,850
Huh? About what?

194
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,070
Oh, that? I wasn't bothered by it at all.

195
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,940
- You weren't?
- No.

196
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,160
At all?

197
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,830
Not at all!

198
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,620
What I'm bothered about is that seasoning.

199
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,110
So what are you going to do? Tell me clearly.

200
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,860
What do you mean? I'll be keeping them safe.

201
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,890
What? You should throw it out!

202
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,600
I don't want to. Why should I?

203
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,250
How much will you give me?

204
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,680
Even if you give me ₩500, I won't throw it away.

205
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,030
Are you really not going to throw it out?

206
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,330
Yeah. I'm a demon, and once you take off the Geumganggo, you're my prey.

207
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,370
In the sense that I can't forget my true identity, I have no intention of throwing it away.

208
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:23,990
I see. I thought that maybe... when the Geumganggo is removed

209
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,600
you wouldn't harm me.

210
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,450
But I guess that wasn't the case.

211
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,550
Alright. Keep your seasonings well.

212
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,130
And let's not forget each other's true identity.

213

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,160
but after it got bad comments online, it's shutting down.

232
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,480
Because of that, can a place that was doing fine shut down?

233
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,600
Of course. These days, once you're targeted, it's really scary.

You don't know what those mean, right? I'll call the owner.

236
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,300
Hello. This is Hanbit Real Estate.

237
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm actually in front of the store with the CEO.

238
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,880
Or I thought I came with her, but it seems I came alone.

239
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,620
Yes, yes. Okay.

240
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,050
- That shop was ruined by a cursing demon.
- A cursing demon?

241
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,060
It's a demon that has a foul mouth.

242
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,090
If you come across those, you either fail as you're cursed or die.

243
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,730
You lose everything.

244
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,180
Is it like a seer?

245
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,160
It's different from that.

246
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Predicting something will happen and making something happen that shouldn't have happened

247
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,000
only because you've cursed them are two different things.

248
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,870
Then... did your store also fail because of a cursing demon?

249
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,150
My grandma is a peddler.

250
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,500
I brought a few things from the shop to make some pocket change.

251
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,620
I see. So you're pilfering from your grandma, huh?

252
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,050
Don't tell anyone that you saw me, okay?

253
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,260
If you want any of these, I'll give it to you.

They call this the love bell.

256
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,330
It's a bell that lets you to know when you meet your match made in heaven.

257
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,800
- Really?
- It's true!

258
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,530
It's used by the Birth Grandmother (goddess governing childbirth).

259
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,380
But this black bell looks prettier.

260
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,710
Ah! Don't touch the black one!

261
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,530
How did the black one get in there?

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,570
It has even caused suicides.

266

Whatever has been affected by the cursing demon will be ruined,

267

I'll make an account with Sam Jang's real name.

Wait, wait. Are you taking a photo for a driver's license?

Hold that handbag.

283
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,030
A fancy bag. Also, your eyes have to give off an air of indifference to cause annoyance to others.

284
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,710
Don't look directly at the camera. Take another picture.

Scroll down, scroll down.

315
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,330
CEO... is this really you?

316
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,840
Yes. I made one earlier today.

317
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,160
You made one earlier today,

318
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,900
but there's already 115,000 followers?!

319
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,980
CEO, I won't beat around the bush.

320
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,110
I'm always "Salute, salute" for you. You know that, right?

321
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,330
A lot of people who don't even know about me that much are talking about me.

322
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,590
It makes me feel weird.

323
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,970
Because these pictures are very show-offy,

324
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,100
there's a lot of criticism, but don't get bothered.

325
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,090
It's because they're envious.

326
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,580
I don't mind. I did it to get cursed at.

327
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,190
What?

328
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,120
I need to get cursed more though...

329
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,080
What do I need to do to get cursed out more?

330
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,180
Hmm, well, since I'm always "Salute, Salute" for you,

331
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,990
let's try thinking about it.

332
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,810
Normally... people who act too cutesy for their age get totally cursed at.

333
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,430
- Cutesy?
- Tee-hee. Things like that.

334
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,280
Tee-hee.

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,670
Why is Sam Jang acting like this?

337
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,610
She's in the midst of catching a cursing demon.

338
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,000
Isn't Son Oh Gong going to catch the evil spirit with her?

339
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,630
Sam Jang discovered the seasonings he made to cover and eat her up with.

340
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,650
Oh, goodness. Sam Jang must be very upset.

341
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,960
What's there to be upset about?

342
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,640
Oh Gong is a demon after all.

343
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,360
By the way, this is too cold.

344
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,090
Take it easy a little. Your strength is too great these days.

345
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,960
My power is at the peak nowadays.

346
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,090
That's probably why you could freeze the Geumganggo.

347
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,690
Y-You knew about that?

348
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,080
Since Sam Jang wanted to know how Great Sage truly felt,

349
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,050
I put in a little strength for just a bit.

350
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,390
I can't do it again.

351
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,650
You did something futile. Until Sam Jang's summons has been fulfilled,

352
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,440
feelings can't ever be allowed to get in the way.

353
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,890
So in order for the two of them to never know how the other truly feels,

354
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,860
you put the Geumganggo on him?

355
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,200
Oh, so cold!

356
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,360
It's so cold my ears have frozen solid.

357
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,020
I'm leaving.

358
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,010
Left is PK and to the right, Alice.

359
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,780
There. With just this one picture, your followers will increase like crazy.

360
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,560
There might even be an article written about it.

361
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,030
Now then, one more.

362
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,440
Hey! I told you not to do that.

363
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,860
It's because having two things sticking out of my front feels awkward.

364
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,390
Once you get used to them, does it become easier to take them around?

365
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,520
What? Well...

366
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,080
You're Sam Jang?

367
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,770
I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

368
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,220
I heard. That you're a prince.

369
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,600
When I'm in a better state, I'll give you a tour of the sea palace.

370
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,860
Hey Octopus, you're flirting even while being in that body?

371
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,610
What? This is instinct.

372
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,640
I've got octopus legs (have player instincts).

373
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,800
If you stretch that leg out to Sam Jang and not watch yourself,

374
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,790
Great Sage will make you into takoyaki (battered and cooked octopus in a ball shape).

375
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,140
Takoyaki?

376
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,320
It makes me feel really pitiful.

377
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,840
Are you Son Oh Gong's woman?

378
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,670
No, I'm not. That kind of expression makes me feel offended.

379
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,940
I know how to make takoyaki as well.

380
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,720
So please watch yourself.

381
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,300
Thank you for taking the pictures.

382
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,740
Like I thought, Sam Jang doesn't have one bit of feelings for Son Oh Gong.

383
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,160
What to do? That poor Great Sage is so pitiful.

384
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,870
By the way, Pig, this woman can't drink alcohol?

Yeah. Alice can't drink—

Hey! When did you drink all that!

387

Not long ago, it attached itself to one of our company's employees,

and that employee jumped off of the roof.

Son Oh Gong, isn't Unni in danger?

Don't you need to go to her?

I will, after I see the spectacle I've been waiting to see.

He should be here by now. Why isn't he here yet?

What is this? How pathetic does it look? What is this?

You dared to turn my bull into a milk cow!

Ma Wang, I think the milk cow is cuter anyway.

Bu Ja, if you think it's cute, should I paint you like that too?

I don't want that.

438

Ma Wang, if the milk cow looks too ugly,

439
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,630
should I paint it completely black?

Don't do that. Is it a wagyu?

Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll paint you whiter than you used to be before.

Yeah, this octopus is drunk right now, so she's coming onto me.

This is too much for me to handle!

00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,310
I can't call up a human. You, hurry up and come. Take her away.

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,280
Okay. I'll come right away.

Hey, stop it!

Where are you going?

I heard they took the video clip here at the agency.

That girl... If she's still alive, I'm sure she's here.

466
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,130
I know I made sure she was dead.

467
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,160
She was a corpse with her arms and legs all broken.

468
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,130
There she is.

469
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,770

A person who is possessed by a cursing demon is bound to be revealed among them. What about Son Oh Gong?

Apparently, the two of them have yet to make up.

It seems you've successfully pitted them against each other. Congratulations.

Son Oh Gong already threw out all the seasoning containers.

00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,840
Ugh, I can't stand the sight of it.

624
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,090
Destroy. Destroy them all. Let them fall apart!

625
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:08,560
Out of all the pathetic dads I've seen, he's the worst.

626
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,050
Yeah. I bought a bunch of snacks, so why ice cream on top of that?

627
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,290
Han Byeol wants to eat it?

628
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,190
Aw, you. You're the one who wants to eat it.

629
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,090
Okay, I'll get it.

630
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,540
Yeah, yeah. See you in a bit. Bye.

631
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,940
Did I get another comment?

632
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,990
At this rate, I'm going to become an SNS star thanks to our CEO.

633

[Out of all the pathetic dads I've seen, he's the worst.]

635
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,240
Pathetic dad?

636
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,510
Why are they calling me that?

637
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,380
- Secretary Son.
- What the heck?

638
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,250
Why are you crying?

639
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,690
What? What is it? What are you doing? What?

640
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,760
Secretary Son.

641
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,450
Ah, come on.

642
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,210
Don't report this kind of thing, you little—

643

Okay, okay. I got it. Just get off me. Off, off!

644
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:52,010
I got a bunch of SNS comments all of a sudden.

645
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:58,320
They're saying when I have nothing,

646
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,190
why did I have two kids?

647
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:11,160
Our Han Byeol... Saying that I'm trying to benefit from turning Han Byeol into a celebrity...

648
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,290
I really never thought anything like that before.

649
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,120
It's just that Han Byeol is cute,

650
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,710
so I just uploaded her singing.

651
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,470
That nasty mouth attached himself near you now, I see.

652
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,000
They all keep talking about me like that

653
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,890
so I really feel like I'm a piece of trash.

654
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,260
Get a hold of yourself! Are you trash?

655
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,580
No.

656
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,010
Don't get swayed by those mere words!

657
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,790
I'll go and rip that blabbermouth to shreds for you. Then it'll be fine, right?

658
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,270
Y-Yeah.

659
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,880
Don't cry anymore!

660
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,310
You're going through a lot of difficulty because of Son Oh Gong, aren't you?

661
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:04,030
I called you here because I had something to tell you that will reassure you.

662
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,820
There's something about Geumganggo that you are still unaware of.

663
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,390
What is it?

664
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:17,770
Geumganggo will cease to exist on its own the moment you complete your summons.

665
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,690
This is a matter that the heavenly realm, myself, and the Great Sage

666
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,810
are all in agreement about so you can believe it.

667
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:30,070
And there is nothing you need to worry about in regards to Son Oh Gong after the Geumganggo is gone.

668
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,620
Once you've completed your summons you will no longer be Sam Jang,

669
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,630
so he'll have no reason to eat you.

670
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:41,860
Son Oh Gong will have absolutely no interest in you anymore.

671
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,750
I see.

672
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,320
Everything's been pre-determined to be over that way.

673
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,960
Do you feel reassured now?

674
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,040
Yes. That's relieving.

675
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,480
She doesn't look particularly reassured or even happy.

676
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:30,950
What Sam Jang was scared of wasn't being eaten.

677
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:36,900
The feelings that would disappear together with the Geumganggo...

678
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,990
She was scared of losing that.

679
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,570
So everything really is going to go away.

680
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,950
That's really reassuring.

681
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,890
Aren't you going home? Again with the cell phone?

682
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,710
Shut up!

683
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,300
I know you're in here.

684
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,690
Don't bother wasting your strength and just come out.

685
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,760
Don't interfere and just get lost!

686
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,580
If you bother me, I'll start cursing you!

687
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,140
Hey, I'm not scared one bit of your blabbering.

688
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,850
Even though everything I say comes true?

689
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:51,790
That mouth of yours that needlessly blabbers and needlessly creates problems...

690
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,750
I'll turn it into an absolutely useless thing.

691
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,620
Here you are.

692
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,860
It's there, right? Put it down while I'm being nice to you.

693
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,940
When all I have is my mouth,

694
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,140
I'm no match for the Great Sage, of course.

695
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,900
Son Oh Gong will die by Sam Jang's hands.

696
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,620
You're going to be killed by that woman.

697
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:51,000
You're going to die. That woman will kill you.

698
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,820
Son Oh Gong is going to be killed by Sam Jang.

699
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,830
That's the woman. The one who will kill you.

700
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,400
That woman is going to kill you.

701
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,730
I'm telling you you're going to be killed by that woman.

702
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:20,680
Son Oh Gong will die by Sam Jang's hand.

703

Are you all right?

705
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,690
That thing just now was the evil spirit that attacked Lee Han Joo, wasn't it?

706
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,480
It looked like he was saying something to you.

707
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,540
What did he say?

708
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:57,280
What's wrong? What did he say that made you like this?

709
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,230
He said that...

710
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,380
you like me.

711
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,280
That's ridiculous.

712
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,450
You know that a cursing demon only says things that aren't true, right?

713
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,460
- That's definitely not true.
- It's definitely not true?

714
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,840
Of course! Definitely not!

715
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,030
You should never believe what a cursing demon says!

716
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,910
All right. I'll never believe it then.

717
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,740
He said you'll kill me.

718
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,950
Now that I think about it, you're the only one in this world who can kill me.

719
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,850
Because if you tell me to die, I'll die.

720
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,790
I'll never allow that. There's no way that'll happen.

721
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,050
Don't ever do that.

722
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,990
And don't leave me behind.

723
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,030
Don't leave me behind to go to another man.

724
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,460
If you do it one more time, I might actually die.

725
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,810
All right.

726
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:24,700
Since as long you're wearing that, your heart will hurt from it.

727
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,740
Don't get angry at me or hate me.

728
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,980
I'm saying that it really hurts me.

729
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,700
I got it. I won't do that.

I can't believe that the first scandal of the year is between a pig and an octopus.

737
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,260
The human beings must not even have an inkling of an idea.

They're talking so much about it because they don't know.

They have no eyes nor ears.

740
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,640
People have to be like a cursing demon who knows nothing but only rambles on

741
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,810
in order for them to dare to ramble on just as recklessly.

Scandals involving celebrities pass by even if you gossip without knowing the truth,

that becomes a serious problem.

If an evil spirit like that were to attach itself to a very influential figure,

it can cause chaos in the world.

01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,440
As suspected, these are dangerous things.

781
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,080
That's why I called some people.

782
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,280
You told on me! Damn it...

783
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,340
That rascal! Secretary Ma, catch him! Run!

784
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,100
Yes.

785
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,540
I'm going to get points from this as well. Thank you.

786
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,040
Don't mention it!

787
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,520
I have to do well until I fulfill all of Sam Jang's summons.

788
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,640
It looks like everything is fine with you and Son Oh Gong.

789
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,630
Yeah. We reconciled and now we're okay.

790
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,680
Since I no longer have to worry about what will happen after the Geumganggo is taken off,

791
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,120
I don't have any expectations, and I feel at peace.

792
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,340
That's a relief. Well, then.

793
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,750
He must've dropped it.

794
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:46,530
You're saying you were selling these valuables for ₩30,000?

795
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,550
And I was the one who caught him.

796
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:51,860
Please make sure to give me my points.

797
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,530
- It's not here!
- What?

798
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,630
Huh?

799
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:05,780
This will tell me who my soulmate is?

800
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,430
A love bell?

801
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,770
It's not a love bell. What disappeared was the black bell!

802
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,980
If it was the black one... the death bell?

803
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:22,380
If it's the death bell, are we talking about the bell that the grim reaper uses?

804
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:27,550
That's right. It's a bell that lets you know a very scary fate.

805
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,840
It's said that when you meet a deadly fate,

806
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,020
you can hear its sound.

807
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,060
What's with this?

808
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:20,060
When the one to die and the one to kill...

809
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,070
when that deadly fate meets,

810
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,720
you can hear the death bell ringing.

♫ It was probably destiny ♫

812
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,890
♫ It was probably pre-destined ♫

813
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,490
♫ Even including when we first met ♫

814
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:13,700
♫ It can't be changed ♫

815
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:20,420
♫ When love is never ending ♫

816
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:27,540
♫ Like the night when even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds ♫

817
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,830
♫ My heart is turning black ♫

[Hwayugi]

819
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,650
I told you I didn't lock them up.

820
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:38,190
The kids don't want to come out.

821
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:41,680
Noona, you can see my little sister, right?

822

♫ I am afraid you might forget me ♫

[Peter Pan]

824
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,630
Where is Sam Jang? I asked where is the person who called me.

825
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,310
- I was the one who called you.
- What are you?

826
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:59,170
I am the new owner of the Geumganggo.
