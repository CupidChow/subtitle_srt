I wonder why I kept them to myself.

25
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,420
When Bu Ja was looking for the human who killed her,

26
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,930
Ah Sa Nyeo possessed her.

27
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,540
After that, she's been by his side helping him.

28
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,020
She's a really bad evil spirit.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,700
What? Pal Gye went to meet Kang Dae Seong?

30
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,330
I tried to stop him, but he said he would kill him and left.

31
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,540
If he goes like this, he will be killed by Ah Sa Nyeo.

32
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,940
What? Why would the pig die?

33
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,340
He is not so weak that he could be killed by Ah Sa Nyeo.

34
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,690
Right now, I've sealed off his power.

35
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,180
I didn't know.

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,990
I just couldn't stand how the pig kept being fooled by the evil spirit.

37
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,120
The matter with Pal Gye is one thing,

38
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,810
but this might ruin all of Son Oh Gong's plans if we leave things be.

39
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,060
Damn it.

40
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,550

41
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,750
Guest?

42
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,740
You really are an unexpected guest, PK.

43
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,120
Kang Dae Seong, do you know Jeong Se Ra?

44
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,640
I asked if you know Jeong Se Ra!

45
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,640
I'm sorry for causing a ruckus.

46
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,820
He seems to be too worked up.

47
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,290
Exactly what is this?

48
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,910
You know Jeong Se Ra, right?

49
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm aware that she's staying here.

50
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,020
So?

51
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,110
She was an idol trainee at my agency.

52
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,740
It's something that would be troublesome if the public knew about it,

53
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,500
but she was very close to him.

54
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,200
So to speak, although there was news about PK and Alice dating,

55
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,350
in reality, the real lover is someone else, well...

56
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,310
It's something like that.

57
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,000
Is that so?

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,000
After hearing that the girl he likes and has dated is staying here these days,

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,950
he must have gone completely mad.

60
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,510
I see.

61
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,860
But what kind of relationship do you have with Jeong Se Ra?

62
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,450
Top star PK and an idol trainee may make entertaining gossip, but

63
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,870
to you who has big plans ahead of you, the blow will be huge.

64
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,010
Don't misunderstand. Jeong Se Ra is...

65
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,150
the daughter of a patient that the Korea Foundation was sponsoring.

66
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,120
For starters, why don't we sit and talk?

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,870
It's a late night.

68
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,350
Since we were rude first, we will excuse ourselves for now.

69
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,170
As for each other's problematic issues...

70
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,590
why don't we sort them out later?

71
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,590
Why are you keeping that bastard alive?!

72
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,930
Don't make things complicated. Let's leave quietly.

73
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,330
I guess Sam Jang told you everything.

74
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,750
As for that human, use that crafty brain of yours to deal with him.

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,170
How could you...

76
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,730
How could you...

77
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,840
How could you be like this?

78
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,620
What are you expecting to achieve by haphazardly barging in there?

79
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,410
Then set me free from this. Free me!

80
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,150
You really don't listen!

81
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,510
If he's hit by that right now, he'll die.

82
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,090
I sealed your powers because I knew you would do something like this!

83
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,150
Stay still for now.

84
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,100
I promised not to interfere with Son Oh Gong's plan which he is risking his life for.

85
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,320
You two need to follow my orders.

86
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,380
Then, are you going to just let them live like that?

87
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,770
Ah Sa Nyeo will die anyway.

88
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,210
When the black dragon disappears, Ah Sa Nyeo will also be eliminated.

89
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,330
Kang Dae Seong will be ruined.

90
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,780
Until then, don't cause any trouble.

91
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,890
The Great Sage has put his life on the line?

92
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,640
That's right. He's facing the black dragon.

93
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,010
Even if things go according to plan,

94
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,410
we can't know for certain if he will survive.

95
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,250
Hey, who are you that you would come into my room from the morning and secretly peek at me?

96
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,770
Star candy fell from the sky so I came all the way here.

97
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,120
When I opened my eyes, a fairy was here so I was looking at him.

98
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,410
It's only morning, but you're crazy sweet.

99
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,710
I should've thrown a star candy from the beginning.

100
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,040
All I did was waste time throwing ice cream and cotton candy at you.

101
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,490
Cotton candy was also sweet and nice.

102
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,420
Shall we have a cup of tea?

103
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,460
That park where we ate cotton candy,

104
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,820
if we go there now it should be warm, right?

105
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,480
That's true. Ugh, it was too cold last time.

106
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,190
Still, I liked it.

107
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,980
If we go, there's a padlock I hung.

108
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,570
It should still be there, right?

109
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,630
Probably. Why?

110
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,560
When I was looking at you earlier,

111
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,390
I was wondering what I liked the most.

112
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,000
But there were too many things I liked.

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,850
So there are a lot of things I want to try again.

114
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,440
At the theater, we can watch the warm movies you like.

115
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,950
When it's over, it'd be nice to eat some spicy rice cakes.

116
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,650
We can go to the library and read books together

117
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,130
and go to the supermarket and buy groceries.

118
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,320
We should have cooked a meal together once.

119
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,640
Do you want some more tea?

120
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,810
It was also nice when we went to Lotus Village together.

121
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,670
When we go there, do you think we can meet the white heron again?

122
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,630
Why?

123
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:31,570
Wouldn't she know what we need to do in the future?

124
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,260
- She might.
- Son Oh Gong.

125
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,000
I probably have to summon the evil spirit in that valley, right?

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,650
And you will get rid of it.

127
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,200
What do you think the white heron and the previous Sam Jang would have done?

128
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,800
If it bothers you, you can go again and ask her.

129
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,050
Go. Last time, I went with you so she might have something she wasn't able to say.

130
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,200
So this time, go by yourself and ask her again.

131
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,290
Alright. It'd be a good idea to go.

132
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,790
Take Winter General with you since it might be dangerous.

133
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,860
I will.

134
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,030
I don't want to go to work.

135
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,530
You were planning to go to work?

136
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,290
Would it be okay not to go?

137
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,130
Go. Go to work. You have to earn money to live well.

138
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,580
Jin Seon Mi who lives resolutely no matter what happens,

139
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,680
that's admirable.

140
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,190
Probably the reason why I became like this to this extent

141
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,660
is because you're that kind of person.

142
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,590
That's right.

143
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,780
I'm going to be late. I better hurry.

144
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,510
I'll be back.

145
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,030
Can't she be late? As a human?

146
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,260
I'll arrange a separate place for you to stay.

147
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,690
I'll also have your sarcophagus moved together.

148
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,580
Because you're an unrealistic entity to me,

149
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,830
it didn't occur to me what this looks like in reality.

150
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,520
Do so.

151
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,920
But was Jeong Se Ra really that celebrity's girlfriend?

152
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,190
The girl you killed likes that person.

153
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,840
This kind of talk is uncomfortable, but is the one who brought the dead body back to life

154
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,290
by chance, the woman called Jin Seon Mi?

155
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,920
Does that woman possess that kind of power?

156
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,340
I told you we don't need that woman.

157
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,690
That woman really gets on my nerves.

158
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,530
Because I felt that she was denying me and seeing through me.

159
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,830
It put me in a bad mood.

160
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,330
Like an obstacle, is she in your way?

161
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,770
I don't know what it is.

162
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,120
I have to properly meet that woman one more time.

163
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:03,720
For starters, I've stopped Pal Gye from trying to kill Ah Sa Nyeo and Kang Dae Seong.

164
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,130
We better hurry.

165
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,260
Although he showed up in front of Kang Dae Seong,

166
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,600
I have no desire to continue to interfere in your business.

167
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,390
Just don't interrupt me.

168
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,440
Son Oh Gong, when Sam Jang ends up finding out about all this,

169
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,800
you're sure that she will step forward to fulfill her summons, right?

170
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,470
That's probably why you're hiding it.

171
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,350
But the moment Sam Jang

172
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,410
finds out that she has to sacrifice her life,

173
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,510
she may say, "Son Oh Gong, sorry" and run away.

174
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,350
Wouldn't it be, "Son Oh Gong, thank you?"

175
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,470
"Sorry" is too much.

176
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,300
Whether it's "thank you" or "sorry,"

177
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,510
you're the one who has the shorter end of the stick.

178
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,450
Hey, Ma Wang, for troubling you, "sorry."

179
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,300
For worrying about me, "thank you."

180
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,440
Do you also want "I love you?" If so, I'll do it for you.

181
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,860
Don't kiss my ass.

182
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,850
Even if you do that, I won't get involved in your business.

183
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,000
On behalf of my hidden son,

184
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,420
I'm going to kiss their asses and be favorable to them.

185
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,930
So are you turning back onto the path towards becoming a deity?

186
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,900
That's right. I'm going to become a deity

187
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,960
and after I've gone up to the highest position where no one can challenge me,

188
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm going to find that child.

189
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,820
I am almost at the end of 1,000 years' waiting.

190
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,410
I don't want to mess it up with your problem.

191
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,600
Alright. Ma Wang, good luck to you too.

192
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:39,180
But, exactly what are you going to fight the dragon with?

193
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,490
General Winter is almost done preparing the divine weapons.

194
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,850
Among them is a sword.

195
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,970
I'm going to

196
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,710
use that.

197
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,700
By gathering the energy of the people who participated in Kang Dae Seong's party,

198
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,070
we've made a rock, a bell, and a knife.

199
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,460
This will suffice.

200
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,290
I will give them to you the moment you need them.

201
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,200
You said we were on the same side.

202
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,950
You and I ran away with the censer in the past.

203
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,230
I will hold them for you.

204
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,550
I came to continue the conversation that was interrupted at the party before.

205
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,930
You didn't come here for matters related to real estate.

206
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,870
Didn't you come to see what kind of person I am?

207
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,790
You're right.

208
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,820
Last time, you said you came to see what kind of person I am, didn't you?

209
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,190
What kind of person do I seem to you?

210
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,840
A person who could destroy the world if he gained power.

211
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,820
Someone who doesn't care if one person dies if it's necessary

212
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,110
wouldn't care if several did either.

213
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,450
So, to you,

214
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,380
I'm a person who will gain enough power to control the world.

215
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,900
Did I gain a voter?

216
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,220
- Thank you.
- The people that you look down on

217
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,180
also have the power to drag you down.

218
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,520
Don't underestimate them.

219
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,280
Now I know why I, the human, have to do it.

220
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,830
To let people live ordinarily in an ordinary world,

221
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,960
within it, they made a special person.

222
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,140
So, you who call yourself special, what can you do?

223
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,040
To begin with, chasing a mood breaker like you out of my office.

224
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,020
Please leave.

225
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,290
Don't look down on me!

226
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,660
I seem to have seen something important.

227
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,700
Thank you.

228
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,260
Kang Dae Seong went to see Sam Jang.

229
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,420
We shouldn't let Sam Jang run into him anymore.

230
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,010
- Oh Jeong.
- Yes?

231
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,880
We better go through the ritual that Ah Sa Nyeo has prepared today.

232
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,350
I'll make the preparations.

233
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,300
General Winter, watch over Sam Jang.

234
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,080
Until today is over, no matter what happens, keep her from going anywhere.

235
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
Yes, Hyungnim.

236
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,700
Today? Why are you suddenly rushing things?

237
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,950
I am just preparing as my hyungnim orders me to.

238
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,310
It doesn't matter to me when.

239
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,830
If I direct him, Kang Dae Seong will comply.

240
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,190
It worked out well. The sooner the better for me.

241
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,920
- Because I've really seen a dragon.
- What do you mean you've seen one?

242
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,940
When I met Jin Seon Mi, I saw it through her.

243
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,540
Until now, I thought it was just a symbolic ritual.

244
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,930
Now there really is such a thing, and I believe it is mine.

245
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,440
If I have the dragon,

246
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,260
will I really get power strong enough to destroy the world?

247
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,490
With the dragon's energy, you will rise to the top of the world

248
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,560
and use that power all over the world.

249
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,910
You will get to have stronger power and more fortune than any other king.

250
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,930
I knew it. I was the chosen one.

251
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,000
What is that?

252
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,300
Am I summoning it and is Son Oh Gong getting rid of it?

253
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,490
He said it's a really strong creature.

254
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,560
The doctor we met with,

255
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,380
she was a guardian of another Sam Jang a long ago.

256
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,350
Like you and me.

257
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,710
The white heron survived.

258
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,640
He can also be safe.

259
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,180
Oh Gong told me to accompany you to Lotus Village.

260
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,990
I was waiting for you. I'll gather my things and come out soon.

261
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,060
CEO, you're going to your hometown all of a sudden?

262
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,960
Yes, there's someone I must meet. I'm sorry.

263
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,600
Not at all. Have a good trip.

264
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,940
One moment. There's something on your coat.

265
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:14,760
Stop. Stop crying.

266
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,230
Oh, come here.

267
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,000
Don't cry.

268
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,100
Stop.

269
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,870
Han Byeol, why are you getting married so soon?

270
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,000
Dad is really sad.

271
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,100
Dad, stop crying.

272
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,730
There are so many people. It's embarrassing.

273
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,230
Father, I'll be taking pictures.

274
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,760
Father, please look this way.

275
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,250
Lee Han Joo, when Han Byeol gets married, don't cry too much.

276
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,510
Gosh, I'm a very cool dad.

277
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,640
You look happy.

278
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400
It looks like an ordinary and happy world will continue to exist.

279
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,880
It's a big relief.

280
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,740
Enjoy your trip.

281
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,580
Let's go.

282
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,100
In case I am broken to pieces and disappear,

283
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,250
tell her that I ran away.

284
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,640
That I won't ever return as I've been freed from the Geumganggo.

285
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,360
She'll believe it because I still have this.

286
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,190
♫ Inside my unknowing heart ♫

287
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:34,040
♫ I'm sorry, I believe you ♫

288
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:43,570
♫ I will be with you forever as I was destined to be ♫

289
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,370
♫ You are my everything like this ♫

290
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,290
♫ The one person who can give me everything ♫

291
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:58,660
♫ Even if the world falls apart, it would be only you ♫

292
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,470
♫ Because I love you ♫

293
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,850
The heavens want to give you an unprecedented offer.

294
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,150
Please find the sword Oh Gong hid.

295
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,370
That sword is probably in Sureumdong which he's sealed off.

296
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,560
You will be able to break his seal and find it.

297
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:33,150
If you find it and bring it back, we will give you a position as a deity at once.

298
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,910
Are you telling me to betray Son Oh Gong right now?

299
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,230
Geez, how could I?

300
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,180
It's not betrayal. You're helping him.

301
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,460
Don't insult Ma Wang.

302
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,300
Ma Wang already promised that he wouldn't interrupt the Great Sage's plans.

303
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,230
He is not one to ever break a promise.

304
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,510
Then what about becoming a deity plus a position?

305
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,650
He will never waver. Please leave.

306
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,900
- What? What are you doing?
- No?

307
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:25,340
Hey, does this shop by any chance have an all-in-one key that can open any kind of sealed barrier

308
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,650
and something that can find an item like a sword? Something like a metal detector?

309
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,180
We don't.

310
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,830
Why are you looking for things like that?

311
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,160
Elder Soo Bo Ri also came by looking for the same things.

312
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,900
Really?

313
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,750
You must keep my coming here a secret from that deity.

314
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,320
I'll give it to you. Sheesh, this kid. I was trying to achieve it (becoming a deity) easily but instead I'm getting ripped off.

315
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,560
Forget the money. I'll just let it go.

316
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,860
Since you, Ma Wang, are a regular.

317
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,420
You used to call me Ajusshi.

318
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,200
Grandmother gave me hell over that when I told her about it.

319
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,240
She says I can't call you Ajusshi.

320
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,990
Looks like the peddler is doing a good job teaching you proper etiquette after all.

321
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,070
Earlier, the top star pig came by.

322
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,760
Pal Gye? What did he buy?

323
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,690
I can't tell you that for free.

324
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,020
I got it. I'll pay you so tell me what he bought.

325
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,010
A lighter. A really strong one.

326
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,220
He says he doesn't have his powers right now

327
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,150
and bought the lighter saying that he needed to be the one to burn his own brother later on.

328
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,360
Gosh, that pig.

329
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,760
Should I have erased his seal?

330
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,020
You had a lighter?

331
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,220
Could I borrow it for a bit?

332
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,630
Since it is a magic lighter it won't work with cigarettes. Sorry.

333
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,850
Is he not going to call for me?

334
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,040
[PK]

335
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,870
You need to convey a message for me.

336
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,080
PK, please go to the studio next door.

337
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,040
They're doing your wardrobe check there.

338
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,720
I got it.

339
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,110
I called for you. Because I need to tell you something.

340
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,210
I don't want to see you.

341
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,850
I'm not helping Kang Dae Seong anymore. I'm helping Son Oh Gong.

342
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,790
That's why I can't kill you right now.

343
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,100
That night, I went there to kill you.

344
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,530
But you said you wouldn't hurt me.

345
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,150
Since I know for sure you're not Bu Ja, I can kill you.

346
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,910
I know she wouldn't have wanted something like you in her body either.

347
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,420
You can't kill me. The Great Sage is protecting me.

348
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,690
The Great Sage is not protecting you.

349
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,070
He is protecting Sam Jang with his life so he is just letting the likes of you off the hook.

350
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,430
I can't stand the sight of you, so get lost.

351
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,850
Listen to me.

352
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,910
Do you carry this around so you can burn me?

353
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,430
You said you wanted me to protect this body and continue to be with you.

354
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,640
Because I was fooled.

355
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,940
I'm going to kill you and then take back Bu Ja's body to burn it for her.

356
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,450
Like this?

357
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,390
As long as I'm in this body, you can't ever burn me.

358
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,030
Because this isn't an ordinary human body.

359
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,760
Get out! Get out from my little brother's body, you crazy evil spirit!

360
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,220
I'm not an evil spirit!

361
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,800
No! No!

362
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,850
You again? He's not going to let himself be fooled by an evil spirit like you anymore.

363
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,730
Move.

364
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,450
You all say that I'm an evil spirit.

365
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,580
Fine. I'm an evil spirit.

366
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,390
An evil spirit should summon an evil spirit.

367
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,020
What's going on?

368
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,850
Don't come. You don't have the power to put out the fire.

369
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,150
If you come next to me, it'll spread to you.

370
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,130
I'm fine, so please call Ma Wang.

371
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,990
What if you completely burn and disappear before he gets here?

372
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,920
Even so, I'm Jeo Pal Gye.

373
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,220
I'll do whatever is necessary to withstand it somehow,

374
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,210
so hurry and call Ma Wang over.

375
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,320
I am weak, but I come from a water kingdom.

376
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,010
I will put out the fire for you.

377
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,870
H-Hey!

378
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,390
Pig, when the fire is all put out,

379
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,710
since I'm made from the power of water, I'll disappear.

380
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,100
Just think that I went back to the dragon sea palace.

381
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,980
Hey, no! You can't! This is not right! Hey!

382
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,330
No! Let go! Quickly!

383
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,190
Don't do this! Let go!

384
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,590
Hey! I said no! Let go!

385
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,460
Hey! I said you can't!

386
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,030
No!

387
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,260
I'm sorry.

388
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,860
I'm so sorry.

389
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,090
Are you waking up the black dragon that's resting inside this valley today?

390
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,920
That's what I need to do.

391
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,720
When we use the divine energies to wake up the dragon,

392
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,930
it's going to fly through the valley and head this way.

393
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,420
It's going to try to use this gate to come out into the world.

394
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,440
I have to get rid of it before it passes through here and comes out.

395
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,280
Starting now, I won't leave here until the end.

396
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,400
Yes. Defend it. I'll make the preparations.

397
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,110
- What about Sam Jang?
- I heard that she and Winter General arrived near the village.

398
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,550
I feel bad making her go and search for the white heron that she won't be able to meet.

399
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,150
That doctor all of a sudden packed up her things and left for someplace else not long ago.

400
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,250
Do you know where she went?

401
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,030
I don't know.

402
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,670
She just said that she would be going somewhere extremely far away and wouldn't be able to see us.

403
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,620
Did she live with anyone?

404
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,760
No, she lived alone.

405
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,210
She didn't have any family.

406
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,360
As expected, it was a lie.

407
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,180
What are you referring to?

408
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,100
He told me that because she did her job so well that she became a deity

409
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,490
and that they are living well together.

410
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,930
I didn't believe him since one of the two was a human.

411
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,020
Let's go down to the village and search for people who know her.

412
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,340
Just like how Ma Wang tried to do before,

413
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,200
is she trying to start a new life?

414
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,650
That could be possible.

415
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,820
For now, let's try searching for her.

416
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,150
What's wrong?

417
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,220
I remember how she was standing there at the end.

418
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,720
What was on her mind that made her have such a sad expression?

419
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,730
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

420
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,860
I want to take a look around a bit.

421
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,710
There might be some type of trace she left behind.

422
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,300
As you wish.

423
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,290
I'm going to get rid of the black dragon before it comes out into the world.

424
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,740
With my power, I'm going to release it out into the world.

425
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,060
Because they call me an evil spirit.

426
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,630
What's the matter?

427
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,980
The white heron waited ardently for something here.

428
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,570
To find what she had been waiting for,

429
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,930
she called me and him here.

430
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,940
Because she found it, she probably left this place, right?

431
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,940
I haven't found anything for her,

432
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,790
so Son Oh Gong must have found something for her.

433
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,580
Why didn't he tell me about that?

434
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,520
I need to go.

435
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,000
You'll know if you find the white heron.

436
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,330
Why don't you go down to the village?

437
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,340
I can't find her, right?

438
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,010
Knowing she's not here, he sent me here, didn't he?

439
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,150
While I'm gone, what is he trying to do?

440
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,870
Today, please stay here according to his wishes.

441
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,300
I want to go.

442
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,880
You can't.

443
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,230
Winter General, when you acted alone

444
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,330
to protect your sister, was she happy about it?

445
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,150
How sad your sister was,

446
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,060
you must know best since you shared the same body.

447
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,110
If he's not going to tell me anything even if I go to him,

448
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,690
please take me to Elder Soo Bo Ri.

449
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,200
I have to do the things I need to do.

450
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,410
So I need to know what they are.

451
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,360
I didn't know you would come looking for me.

452
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,570
Does the Great Sage know of this visit?

453
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,570
I came to look for you.

454
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:46,040
Please let me know the things Son Oh Gong kept hidden from me.

455
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,700
Get out of the way.

456
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,290
Pal Gye was injured and Jade Dragon died.

457
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,140
They are part of my agency.

458
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,440
I can no longer leave Ah Sa Nyeo alone.

459
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,930
Ma Wang, then the Great Sage's plans will be ruined.

460
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,190
At this time, it's better that they are ruined.

461
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,240
Because of Sam Jang, the monkey is overworking himself too much.

462
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,510
Ma Wang.

463
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,910
I'm busy.

464
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,030
The heavens will deal with Ah Sa Nyeo.

465
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,790
Why are the heavens suddenly interfering in Ah Sa Nyeo's business?

466
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:28,460
Sam Jang made her decision.

467
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,970
To complete all of Sam Jang's summons,

468
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:42,120
the entire heavens will now move according to Sam Jang's will.

469
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:49,220
Please tell the Great Sage that we will capture and keep Ah Sa Nyeo.

470
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,730
In the end, it won't go

471
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,910
according to Son Oh Gong's plan.

472
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,200
The debate was gratifying and fun. Thank you!

473
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,630
- It was fun.
- You're handsome, Professor.

474
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,630
See you next time.

475
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,930
Yes. Goodbye.

476
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,680
[Kang Dae Seong, explain Korea Foundation's pro-Japanese deeds!]

477
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,180
[Reveal the death of the journalist!]

478
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,970
[You're not the bowl that will contain this generation's spirit!]

479
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,960
They can drag you down. Don't underestimate them.

480
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,520
You're creating a dangerous situation.

481
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,390
- Leave for the valley now.
- Right now?

482
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,000
Yes. Everything is prepared.

483
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,560
So I can go just like this?

484
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,930
You're also already prepared.

485
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,940
You're bad enough to become the black dragon's owner.

486
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,930
That's all you need.

487
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,970
That...

488
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,890
is blood, I see?

489
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,420
You're not asking what kind of blood it is.

490
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,960
You probably also did something you needed to do.

491
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,800
Then, I'll go there.

492
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,990
Perhaps, he could be the most compatible match for an evil spirit.

493
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,530
The preparations are all made, but something happened.

494
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,810
Pal Gye got seriously injured and the Jade Dragon died.

495
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,200
It is the doing of Ah Sa Nyeo.

496
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,980
Ma Wang said he would immediately capture and kill Ah Sa Nyeo.

497
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,200
I better go to Ma Wang.

498
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,390
No need.

499
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,710
Is it over there? The black dragon?

500
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,350
If it's growing because of the evil that gathers and gets stagnant,

501
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,740
keeping it like that, it will gradually become enormous.

502
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,070
To wake that up and take care of it now, I need Ah Sa Nyeo.

503
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,730
Although I know of your desire to kill her, you can't yet.

504
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,640
The heavens have stepped forward to take care of Ah Sa Nyeo.

505
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,180
Elder Soo Bo Ri said they will capture and hold her there.

506
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,600
They're giving me a headache by getting involved again.

507
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,920
I'm not on your side or the heavens'.

508
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,740
I don't want to get involved.

509
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,700
I don't want to give you any advice either.

510
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,720
Fair enough. I don't want to ruin what you've been waiting 1,000 years for.

511
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,910
Son Oh Gong, are you overworking yourself like this right now

512
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,190
only to save Sam Jang?

513
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,020
If that's true, have you thought about just taking Sam Jang

514
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,800
and running away together?

515
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,450
Whether a black dragon emerges or not.

516
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,050
No matter what happens to the world or not. Don't think about those things.

517
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,030
You can just take that woman

518
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,000
and live somewhere far away together.

519
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,670
I don't want to. It's uncool.

520
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,930
I want to look cool in her eyes.

521
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,430
What if I were scared of the black dragon and suggested running away but she says, "No!"

522
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,970
I would totally become pathetic.

523
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,860
She thinks I'm really amazing.

524
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,100
Fine. Die looking cool.

525
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,140
I want to gradually become even more amazing.

526
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,480
She makes me want to do so.

527
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,560
When you first put on the Geumganggo,

528
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,330
you said you became a mutt that protects a lowly human woman

529
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,700
and cried your eyes out while holding that sauce jar.

530
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,620
Who knew you would place your life on the line now

531
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,470
to catch an enormous black dragon?

532
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,270
If I look cool, then that's all that matters.

533
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,890
But you know...

534
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,690
won't Sam Jang want to look cool as well?

535
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,670
To you.

536
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,700
If Sam Jang steps forward looking cool, can you stop her? What are you going to do?

537
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,390
I won't be able to stop her.

538
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,950
That's why I'm trying to stand in front, hide her, and do something.

539
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,220
When it's all finished, come home.

540
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,910
Make sure to come home. I'll be bored.

541
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,890
Okay.

542
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,910
Fill the bathtub with water. Make it nice and warm.

543
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,540
Alright.

544
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,960
Make sure to come home.

545
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,350
Hyungnim, what should we do now?

546
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,790
I should go and meet Elder Soo Bo Ri.

547
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,850
Go back and tidy up the loose ends.

548
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,350
I will also stay here.

549
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,430
The only one to entrust with tidying up is you alone.

550
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,900
Do that.

551
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,890
I understand.

552
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,260
Teacher.

553
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,220
Why are you getting in my way?

554
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,610
You came, Great Sage.

555
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,820
The only one who can summon the black dragon is Ah Sa Nyeo.

556
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,120
Ah Sa Nyeo is the connecting hook between the black dragon and the evil human being.

557
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,110
Later on, I will also get rid of her so hand her over for now.

558
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,610
Oh Gong, I'm proud of you

559
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,910
for wanting to save the world sincerely.

560
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,000
I am not doing this to make you proud of me.

561
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,970
If you finish this well, you will be reinstated to the heavens.

562
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,800
Reinstated?

563
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,470
I don't think I'm doing a good deed for the heavens.

564
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,170
What is it? Where is Ah Sa Nyeo?

565
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,410
What is going on right now?

566
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,010
As you said, the only one that can wake the black dragon is Ah Sa Nyeo.

567
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,030
And right about now, she probably woke the dragon.

568
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,920
You tricked me.

569
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,350
It's not Ah Sa Nyeo that you're trying to keep here right now, but it's me.

570
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:07,680
Stop the Great Sage.

571
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,830
It's awake.

572
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,600
Now, through this door, your dragon will come out into the world.

573
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,160
Wake the dragon as planned.

574
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,200
That's as much as you can do as an evil spirit.

575
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,440
The heavens will take care of the rest.

576
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,960
Since I was told to do what I can,

577
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,550
I'll try setting it loose into the world.

578
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,750
The black dragon woke up and is moving.

579
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,130
She woke the black dragon.

580
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,280
By chance, are you thinking of letting it loose into the world?

581
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,940
You have something you're counting on, don't you?

582
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:59,780
Is it by chance... Sam Jang?

583
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,470
Stop it.

584
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,050
You can't summon that and release it into the world.

585
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,140
I can't allow it to serve him as its master.

586
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,080
If that happens, the world will be destroyed.

587
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,270
Continue.

588
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,090
I said to continue!

589
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,250
So you dragged her into this after all?

590
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,830
It is Sam Jang's choice.

591
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,710
- Only Sam Jang can stop it.
- I said I will do it!

592
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,590
It's something that only Sam Jang, a human, can do!

593
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,790
Sam Jang also accepted that!

594
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,320
This is Sam Jang's will.

595
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,680
Sam Jang commanded the heavens to

596
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,990
keep you trapped here.

597
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,790
I told you I could stop you, didn't I?

598
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,160
You can never become the master of that dragon.

599
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,950
- The dragon of the sky chose me.
- That's why I'm stopping you.

600
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,720
I'm going to contain that and get rid of it.

601
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,920
There's nothing you can gain.

602
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,660
A world of humans like you won't come to be.

603
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,680
Shut up!

604
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,880
Don't interfere!

605
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:40,400
You brought upon your own destruction.

606
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,160
How did Son Oh Gong escape?

607
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,890
Ma Wang, did you help him?

608
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,630
All I did was add a bit of strength.

609
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:42,300
If the heavens saw Sam Jang's choice,

610
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,650
I want to see Son Oh Gong's choice.

611
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:52,880
He fought off the dragon, took Sam Jang and disappeared.

612
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,420
The black dragon didn't disappear. It remains.

613
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,450
The black dragon will come out into the world at this rate.

614
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,830
Jin Seon Mi.

615
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,130
Jin Seon Mi?

616
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,280
I'm sorry.

617
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,870
You can't be here. Go.

618
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,570
I don't want to.

619
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:01,390
You have to go.

620
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,790
I don't want to.

621
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:10,640
You always do everything I ask of you.

622
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:23,180
The Great Sage, Son Oh Gong, go and

623
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,340
finish it off in my place.

624
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:38,390
To be honest, I hoped your love wouldn't disappear,

625
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,430
but I'm fine with it now.

626
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:50,260
Because there is the Geumgganggo, I'm reassured.

627
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,810
It's a relief that when you're left by yourself,

628
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:22,560
love won't be left behind.

629
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,240
Jin Seon Mi.

630
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:51,280
Jin Seon Mi.

01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:29,680
Sam Jang died.

637
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:43,130
Now, there's nothing that can stop the dragon.

638
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,640
I said that I will see Son Oh Gong's choice.

639
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,090
This world where Sam Jang has died,

640
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,210
what will Son Oh Gong do about it?

641
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:24,020
The black dragon... disappeared.

642
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,860
Son Oh Gong...

643
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,140
defeated it.

644
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,950
Jin Seon Mi.

645
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,610
The world is the same as before but...

646
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:59,590
here, in this place...

647
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,240
you are no longer here.

648
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:07,310
♫ I'm missing you ♫

649
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:22,090
♫ I picture the memory which clearly remains in the same place ♫

650
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,740
♫ I believe in you ♫

651
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:36,730
♫ I'm missing you ♫​

652
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:42,670
♫ Even if you are a little late, it's okay. I understand ♫

653
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,230
♫ I know you will return ♫

654
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:56,750
♫ If there's any of me left inside of you ♫

655
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:59,040
[Hwayugi]

656
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:07,070
♫ Would you see me somewhere ♫

657
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:14,870
♫ Have you lost me, whom you wanted to see ♫

658
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:24,020
♫ I long for you, the only one who cannot be replaced ♫

659
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:29,560
♫ Each day, even if it hurts, I'll believe in you ♫
