[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,120
I can manipulate souls.

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,080
What I want is you.

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,390
From now on, you'll stay by my side forever, unchanged.

7
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,870
You will protect me.

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,310
What is Son Oh Gong doing that I shouldn't call for him?

9
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,430
It's something very important.
[Episode 13]

10
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,100
He went with Bu Ja. Did something happen to Bu Ja again?

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,620
The one who is with Son Oh Gong isn't Bu Ja.

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,830
What?

13
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,350
The one in possession of that body right now is a priestess named Ah Sa Nyeo.

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,190
We woke her up by mistakenly disturbing that tree.

15
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:42,060
Ah Sa Nyeo? Then what is Son Oh Gong doing with Ah Sa Nyeo?

16
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,890
I'm a priestess who can call a dragon.

17
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,700
I called a dragon and crowned a king,

18
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:58,810
but that king broke his contract of marriage with me, tricked me, and locked me up.

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm going to create for myself a partner who will never betray me.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,630
Great Sage, from now on, you need to protect me the way you've been protecting Sam Jang until now.

21
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,600
Shall I get rid of this now?

22
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,970
Now, you're mine.

23
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,980
Okay, I'll give him to you. You can have him.

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,950
- What the?
- I'm Oh Gong. That's Chil Gong. (Oh = 5, Chil = 7)

25
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,460
You can have Chil Gong, but you can't have Oh Gong.

26
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,710
Because he has his own master already.

27
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,160
Sorry, Chil Gong!

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,210
I feel bad sending you to a women with such a nasty temperament,

29
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,280
but what can I do when she wants you?

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,210
You go instead and treat her well.

31
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,870
I'm thankful for the gift.

32
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,680
This one is also cute, but as I suspected,

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,470
the most suitable partner for me is you, Great Sage.

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm not so sure about that. You're not pretty at all.

35
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,200
You're just so-so. What's your charm? Try selling it.

36
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm extremely powerful.

37
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,380
I'm a priestess with powers that Sam Jang can't hold a candle to.

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:25,010
I was betrayed by a human and unfairly locked up for over a thousand years.

39
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,490
I came here to complete a marriage which I wasn't able to fulfill.

40
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,570
And I've decided on you, Great Sage, as my partner.

41
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,620
You even called a dragon for him, but your groom-to-be tricked you and locked you up on your wedding day.

42
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,030
You must have felt really wronged.

43
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,320
I don't really care if you carry out your unfinished wedding or not,

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,390
but I can't let you get away with saying you'll take Sam Jang's place.

45
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,460
And on top of that, hearing you say that while you're wearing the face of Bu Ja whom Sam Jang cherishes,

46
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,370
I can't bear listening to you anymore.

47
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,550
Sam Jang cherished her, didn't she?

48
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,500
How about you, Son Oh Gong?

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,760
Can you get rid of this child?

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,610
Becoming an evil spirit was what she feared the most.

51
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,250
An evil spirit? I'm not a little thing like that!

52
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,310
I made a promise with Bu Ja that I'd burn her here.

53
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,810
And I'm going to have to fulfill that promise now.

54
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,010
I'm not that mere possessed corpse right now either.

55
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,900
You must've heard that I'm very strong.

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,290
I know. That's why I was going to have Ma Wang handle you, but I have no choice now.

57
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,270
Ah Sa Nyeo. You're going to have to go back to sleep here.

58
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,400
I doubt this is the right time to be fighting with me though.

59
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,570
No. Once I've made up my mind, I have to see it through till the end.

60
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,810
If you continue like this, Sam Jang will be in danger.

61
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,490
- What?
- The food that I brought for her...

62
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,790
I wonder if she ate it yet?

63
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,220
If she eats so much as just one bite of it, she'll be in danger.

64
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,160
If she by chance ate it, then you'll need to hurry over there and have her take this.

65
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,540
- Jin Seon Mi!
- You're here?

66
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,650
- Are you okay?
- Why? What is it?

67
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,710
Did you eat the food Bu Ja brought you?

68
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,500
No.

69
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,070
Oh, Son Oh Gong.

70
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,450
Did you find out anything?

71
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,650
- Ma Wang, are you all right?
- Why? What's wrong?

72
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,390
You're okay even though you're eating that?

73
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,290
It's good though.

74
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,520
You ate all of this?!

75
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,340
I was hungry so I just took some.

76
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,510
You didn't notice anything strange?

77
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,820
What? What is it?

78
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,450
It was a little salty.

79
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,820
You're completely fine.

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,680
Ugh, damn it!

81
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,870
What do you want me to do when I've already eaten it? Should I spit it out?

82
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,060
That's not it. Just swallow it!

83
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,710
Did something happen? What's wrong with you?

84
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,920
That bitch tricked me.

85
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,260
That monkey makes me want him.

86
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,080
Horrible monkey.

87
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,470
What Ah Sa Nyeo wants is to complete the wedding she couldn't fulfill?

88
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,220
That's what she said.

89
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,420
If she got tricked and locked up on the day of her wedding, she must have quite a big grudge.

90
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,540
Isn't it a simple matter of letting her carry out her wedding ceremony and relieving her grudge?

91
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,580
If we give her what she wants, then she might even give back Bu Ja's body, too.

92
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,140
It would be a relief if we could end this just by doing that.

93
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,930
She can't get married by herself.

94
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,120
Is there a specific partner that she wants?

95
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,680
Because she's a strong priestess, she wants a strong enough partner to match that.

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,800
That's why I'm saying this, but how about you do it, Ma Wang?

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,730
Are you out of your mind? I've been remaining faithful to one person for 1,000 years now. That makes no sense.

98
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,080
You don't want to?

99
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,020
Then let's have Pal Gye, who's close to Bu Ja, do it.

100
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,910
Jeo Pal Gye himself told me that he's the most famous Lothario evil spirit.

101
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,770
Would that be okay?

102
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:27,260
Instead of Pal Gye, I feel like there's another more appropriate partner though...

103
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,180
Then there's no helping it.

104
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,910
We'll have to send her to Oh Jeong.

105
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,010
Sa Oh Jeong? Have a conscience for goodness' sake!

106
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,480
Why? What's wrong with our Oh Jeong? He's rich and does chores around the house.

107
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,470
Don't you know how cute he is when he smiles? He's full of charms!

108
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,580
Wouldn't it be best to just ask Ah Sa Nyeo directly whom she wants?

109
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,420
We can't do that.

110
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
We can't give her whom she wants.

111
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,330
Why not? Who is it?

112
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,120
Ahem. Secretary Ma, I think Sam Jang is thirsty.

113
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,390
Give her more water.

114
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,720
Just bring more water for me, please.

115
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,070
Secretary Ma!

116
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,080
The water dispenser is this way. Let's go.

117
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,300
The one Ah Sa Nyeo wants is you, right?

118
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,070
She directly chose you saying she likes you, didn't she?

119
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,270
Yeah.

120
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,570
She said she's a priestess who is more powerful than Sam Jang.

121
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,140
And that she'll take the Geumganggo off and be good to me.

122
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh, is that so?

123
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Then I guess a chance for you to live has come your way.

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
A chance?

125
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,260
You two share a deadly fate.

126
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,040
You're either going to be killed or kill.

127
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,530
In this situation, then the probability that Sam Jang will be the one to die increases.

128
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,150
As for me,

129
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,190
if one of us has to die, I thought...

130
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,040
it would obviously be me.

131
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,390
You must have felt it unfair.

132
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,280
It is unfair.

133
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,300
But...

134
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,660
when I realized she could be the one to die, too,

135
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,570
it feels even more unfair.

136
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,340
It's unfair for me, and it's unfair for Sam Jang, too.

137
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,960
I have nothing to do with it.

138
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,750
This was all orchestrated by the heavenly realm.

139
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,680
The heavenly realm arranged it.

140
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,340
That psycho seems to have completely lost it now.

141
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,910
Do I need to give Elder Soo Bo Ri a heads up about this?

142
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,510
Great Sage!

143
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,830
I'm a little busy right now.

144
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,110
A death bell? What are you trying to do with this?

145
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,970
Oh Gong, remember I'm your teacher.

146
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,160
Who's going to kill and who's going to be killed? Tell me.

147
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,580
I don't know. That's something the heavenly realm decided.

148
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,370
I only know that you two have a deadly fate.

149
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,990
So that was already decided from the beginning and then you involved us, huh?

150
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,580
And you put the Geumganggo on me to protect her?

151
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,390
If you're going to tell us to kill or be killed, then you shouldn't have put this damn thing on me in the first place!

152
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,250
Sam Jang's summons is an important matter.

153
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,370
A sacrifice is needed for her summons.

154
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,280
A deadly fate? A lousy thing like that doesn't exist.

155
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,390
Now that I've come this far, I'm going to protect her until the very end.

156
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,650
And if I'm protecting her, she will never die.

157
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,400
They need a sacrifice? Tell this to them loud and clear:

158
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,360
If they mess with the Great Sage, Son Oh Gong,

159
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,380
they will also have to sacrifice on their end.

160
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,540
It is their mistake to mess with me.

161
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,460
Did we really make a mistake?

162
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,510
Why are you blaming me for this?

163
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,690
You made the decision, though!

164
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,060
For a priestess to have appeared before Son Oh Gong is an opportunity for him to live.

165
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,500
But I don't know if this idiot will waste this good opportunity.

166
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,950
Is it really impossible to change a fate that has been decided by the heavens?

167
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,820
I'm not able to go against it either, so I've been like this for a thousand years.

168
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,530
Those wretched beings.

169
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,100
Great Sage's situation is different from yours, Ma Wang.

170
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,850
Since he is a deity, he should be able to interfere with human lives, isn't that so?

171
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,770
How would this pathetic demon

172
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,800
know about what a great deity is capable of doing?

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,440
I just need to diligently rack up points.

174
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,550
Ever since you saw her ninth reincarnation, you seem to have become more anxious.

175
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,890
I must end the painful cycle of death and rebirth for her this time around.

176
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,520
In order to do that, we must safely deal with Ah Sa Nyeo.

177
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,520
What Ah Sa Nyeo wants is to get married to Great Sage.

178
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,840
Is that possible?

179
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,370
That's why I've already spoken to Sam Jang.

180
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,410
It's not even raining. What's wrong with the sky?

181
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,470
They must have gotten a little angry too.

182
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,620
Why did you come back again?

183
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,750
I came to protect you.

184
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,670
When I know that there is an evil girl around, I can't leave you alone on a night like this.

185
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,920
Her eyes are black, and she's really scary.

186
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,360
I heard she came on to you with a scary speed.

187
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,370
You must have been happy.

188
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,600
Ma Wang must have said something again.

189
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,720
Whatever Ma Wang said, it's to make me look bad, so just ignore it.

190
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm not concerned about it. I heard what that woman wants is you.

191
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,660
It doesn't matter to me.

192
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,710
Does it really not matter?

193
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,720
Even if it mattered to me, will anything change?

194
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,730
Fine, you marry that woman.

195
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,520
It's not even a big deal.

196
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,330
The lids are switched. That one doesn't go with that.

197
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,590
Whether you have a wedding or not, it doesn't matter to me.

198
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,590
I said that those don't go together.

199
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,740
Is that important right now? Is it important that these don't match?

200
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,650
It's important.

201
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,690
This and this are a match.

202
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,190
But if you ask this one to be a match with this one,

203
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,710
then of course it's blowing its lid.

204
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,400
That's why you're blowing your lid off right now.

205
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,550
It's completely blown off.

206
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,370
I'll close it for you.

207
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,800
What are you doing right now?

208
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,970
Do you think this is enough?

209
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,810
Close it tighter.

210
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,120
You've gotten more slick, my Sam Jang.

211
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm sorry, Son Oh Gong. I awoke something strange.

212
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,110
So I know shouldn't get angry at you.

213
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,720
It's Ma Wang's fault.

214
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,910
When you're suffering, blame others. It's good for your mental health.

215
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,290
I'm scared.

216
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,110
Like that other time, I might hurt you again. I'm scared.

217
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,610
Just hold onto me tightly. Then we'll be fine.

218
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,080
That sarcophagus is over a thousand years old.

219
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,030
Looking at the patterns engraved inside, it seems like they were sealing whatever was contained in it.

220
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,080
Yes, it must have been something that was considered extremely dangerous.

221
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,880
You said they are talismans with very strong incantations, right?

222
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,200
It must have been a being that was extremely feared.

223
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,210
This type of dragon symbolizes a king.

224
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,590
A dragon like this wouldn't be engraved just anywhere.

225
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,260
The owner of that sarcophagus had as much power as

226
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,720
or perhaps more power than a king.

227
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,660
It seems so.

228
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,930
That means it is dangerous, feared, and also strong.

229
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,170
That's quite interesting.

230
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,410
Oh, pretty lady, I'm sorry.

231
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,960
You're quite a beautiful woman.

232
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,160
So we were thinking of buying you a drink.

233
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,710
Am I pretty?

234
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,960
Oh, of course! You're really pretty.

235
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,910
So do you want to go with us?

236
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,090
Okay.

237
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,990
Let's go.

238
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,580
I can't recover my blood's strength with these types of things.

239
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,590
I need Sam Jang's body.

240
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:12,840
I can't let you get away with saying you'll take Sam Jang's place.

241
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,620
Should I make good use of Ma Wang?

242
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,000
Since I know his weakness.

243
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,250
There is a rose scent that comes from the Priestess Ah Sa Nyeo?

244
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,080
Yes. You have a lotus flower scent. She has a rose one.

245
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,610
But I heard that she's very strong.

246
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,660
Why don't I have any strength?

247
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,570
It would be nice if there were things I could do, too.

248
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,940
Your blood is stronger because she woke up in someone else's body right now.

249
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,280
In any case, it's worrisome.

250
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,560
I heard that she needs to be sent back safely for Bu Ja to recover her body

251
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,460
and for Ma Wang to protect his points too.

252
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,680
Just what was Ma Wang crying to you about?

253
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,970
Becoming a deity is right in front of my eyes,

254
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:37,000
but I'm going to have points taken away again.

255
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,150
Ma Wang.

256
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,120
I need to do what Ah Sa Nyeo wants,

257
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,210
and put her back to sleep without an issue.

258
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,760
In order to do that, let's send Son Oh Gong.

259
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,510
But still, to send him off to get married is a bit...

260
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,520
It's just a formality.

261
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,990
But still, his heart is yours, Sam Jang.

262
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,110
Is having a wedding such a big deal?

263
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,270
And we can save Bu Ja as well.

264
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,890
Bu Ja?

265
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,060
Bu Ja.

266
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,080
Poor Zombie.

267
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,990
Our Bu Ja still needs to be reincarnated.

268
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,570
My points!

269
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,470
If it's just for a formality, then you should just get married.

270
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,680
Are you really okay with it?

271
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,990
It's fine. I've already done it with you twice.

272
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,490
We already went through two fake wedding ceremonies in order to chase away evil spirits.

273
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,550
If I think of it as similar to that, I'm fine with it.

274
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,730
Ah Sa Nyeo is said to be dangerous if left alone.

275
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,980
Let's call her, placate her, and send her away.

276
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,150
Since I'm Sam Jang.

277
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,480
Should we do it one more time?

278
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,210
Do what?

279
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,910
Two times were fake. Should we do it a third time for real?

280
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,410
Do you want to marry me?

281
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,670
Is that... possible?

282
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,670
I said I would do anything you wanted.

283
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,980
If you want to, then anything is possible.

284
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,750
Then you can't run away from me, even if you take off the Geumganggo.

285
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,620
That's fine.

286
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,800
Jin Seon Mi,

287
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,090
hold onto me even tighter.

288
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,960
Right now, you're about to make a contract that can't be broken eternally.

289
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,070
That's fine, a contract.

290
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,350
Tell me the conditions of the contract.

291
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,310
A contract...

292
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,020
should be made seriously.

293
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,120
I won't do it quickly like when I was young.

294
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,660
As expected, you've become smarter since you've aged.

295
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,050
Do it as you wish.

296
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay.

297
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,670
I got so angry today, I have a terrible headache.

298
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,540
I'll have to sleep here tonight.

299
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,260
If you're tired, then why are you sleeping here?

300
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,690
Right? Then let's go sleep in the bed.

301
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,650
You must be tired, so let's hurry up and sleep.

302
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,010
Don't try anything tonight. Before you get cursed out, leave nicely.

303
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,580
So what if I get cursed out? I can't leave nicely.

304
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,920
After what I just said to you, do you want to send me away nicely?

305
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,020
I don't want to send you nicely. Do you think it's easy to send you away nicely?

306
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,430
I'm working hard to protect you.

307
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,330
Before I curse, leave quickly.

308
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,940
She was protecting me?

309
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,110
Because our Oh Gong is precious?

310
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,740
Ah, but I like being handled carelessly. Ah, seriously.

311
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,670
I heard that on a rainy day, her child was kidnapped at a bus stop and murdered.

312
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:11,160
She sits out there every day because of the guilt for not going out to drop off her child that day.

313
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,210
Pardon me.

314
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,510
You dropped your bag.

315
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,480
Thank you.

316
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,380
Why did you approach that woman?

317
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,720
That woman carries this sort of stuff in her bag.

318
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,140
It looked like a dangerous object so I managed to take it away from her.

319
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,970
Is there anything else you haven't reported to me?

320
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,780
She stabbed a female student not too long ago.

321
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:39,110
She stabbed an underage girl who was released from prison after killing her daughter.

322
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,220
She was charged with attempted murder, but it seems like she will make another attempt at it soon.

323
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,370
A female student who slashed a little eight-year-old child to death was released from prison after three years.

324
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,830
And I guess it was too painful for her to see that.

325
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,470
It's another repetition of the same life all over again.

326
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,290
Die!

327
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,380
Experiencing the pain of her child dying.

328
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,900
Stabbing the enemy. And in the end, dying as well.

329
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,880
A continual repetition of a tragic life...

330
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,260
You can't, Ma Wang.

331
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,520
If you interfere, she'll suffer even more.

332
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,660
Should I help you?

333
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,510
I think I would be able to help.

334
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,890
Please shut your mouth.

335
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,110
Please stay quietly until you find your sarcophagus and fall asleep again.

336
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,480
I just want to help Ma Wang since he woke me up.

337
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,380
- Please leave.
- Secretary Ma, just let her be.

338
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,320
Ma Wang...

339
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,330
Secretary Ma, please step out for a bit.

340
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,260
Let me at least hear you out once.

341
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,360
You said you were Ah Sa Nyeo. What can you do for me?

342
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,630
I'm a priestess.

343
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:32,400
So I am capable of a lot of things.

344
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,080
Why don't you postpone the meeting to an hour later?

345
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,620
Okay.

346
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,860
What brings you here to the company today, Hyungnim?

347
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,860
The chairman is busy, so I, who am playing around, should come.

348
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,290
I'm sorry. My schedule will free up soon,

349
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,040
so I will stop by your place and catch up on cleaning.

350
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,400
I was concerned about how the white kimchi I made turned out anyway.

351
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,310
I didn't visit you because of the white kimchi, but because there is something that I want you to find out for me.

352
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,180
Of course, please let me know what it is.

353
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,230
Go find out about the priestess. She has been around for 1,200 years.

354
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,860
She calls herself Ah Sa Nyeo.

355
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,940
Also look into the person named Kang Dae Seong while you're at it as well.

356
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,770
Are you talking about Professor Kang Dae Seong of Hankuk University?

357
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,510
Why, what's wrong?

358
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:52,860
The priestess told me that she can call for a dragon to make a king out of a person. And that worries me.

359
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,850
Yes, I understand.

360
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,570
By the way, Hyungnim...

361
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:05,290
So the person that looked like Bu Ja wasn't really her?

362
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,660
That's Ah Sa Nyeo.

363
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,170
I'm worried about her going around everywhere and bewitching people again.

364
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,840
So you're not Bu Ja, huh?

365
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,060
That's right. My name is Ah Sa Nyeo.

366
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,320
Bu Ja was a little brother to me, Jeo Pal Gye.

367
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,990
Bu Ja's real name was Jeong Se Ra, and Bu Ja asked me to keep calling her Bu Ja.

368
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,890
I will be leaving now.

369
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,260
Bu Ja, you are listening, right?

370
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,390
You said that you wanted to meet your family, right?

371
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,810
I will make sure to find them for you.

372
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,190
I'm not Bu Ja, and I have no need to meet a so-called family.

373
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,890
I'm going to make sure to fulfill my little brother's wish.

374
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,200
What is this? Is she still in here?

375
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:43,610
We'll have to see the certified copy of the register, but it seems like there are some unresolved issues.

376
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,850
Do you want to marry me?

377
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,320
CEO.

378
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,030
What have you been thinking about all day anyway?

379
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,330
You're married, right?

380
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,390
Of course I am. I have two kids. Look.

381
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,680
You're wearing a wedding ring because you love your wife, right?

382
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,330
That's right.

383
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,110
Then let's say that ...

384
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,890
you didn't love her at first...

385
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:22,880
but the moment you put the wedding ring on your finger, you suddenly fell madly in love.

386
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,830
Then would it be okay to get married?

387
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,770
We put the wedding ring on because we felt madly in love with each other.

388
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,080
That's not what I meant...

389
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,300
What I'm saying is, there was no love originally but after putting the bracelet— I mean...

390
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,040
after putting the ring on, he says he's in love.

391
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,240
Miss CEO, did you a buy a ring for Secretary Son?

392
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,030
I guess you put a ring on him with a diamond this big which sprouts love that didn't exist before, didn't you?

393
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,230
That's not love.

394
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,540
A love like that will be over once you take the ring off.

395
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,170
Diamond, gosh.

396
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,450
It's a bracelet, not a ring.

397
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,260
CEO, please pass me the seal.

398
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,750
CEO, seal please.

399
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,760
Oh, okay.

400
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,060
If the love that wasn't there before came to be because of a thing,

401
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,320
then once that thing disappears, the love will disappear, too.

402
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,580
You shouldn't trust that type of stuff and get married.

403
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,500
Is that how it is?

404
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,000
♫ Whatever you do ♫

405
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,280
♫ I can't stop my laughter ♫

406
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,040
♫ To me, you become love ♫

407
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,120
♫ To me, you become my world ♫

408
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,200
♫ For some reason, I don't think I dislike this right now  ♫

409
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,230
I said, S-E-A-L, please.

410
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,530
♫ I will always be by your side ♫

411
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,360
Right here.

412
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,200
But if I set about a hundred diamonds in it

413
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,640
and keep on giving until I die so that he won't disappear, then the love won't disappear, right?

414
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,960
Then, I can do it, right?

415
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,280
If you are so capable to the point where you're able to provide him with a bigger and bigger and bigger stone for the rest of your life,

416
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,860
then you should go for it.

417
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,420
It would be great if you could give me a raise instead.

418
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,660
Thank you.

419
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,610
♫ When I saw you ♫

420
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:05,170
♫ I think only about you ♫

421
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:10,760
♫ When I love you ♫

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,260

427

♫ Always behind of you ♫

429
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,620
CEO. CEO!

430
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,030
CEO, you gave me the wrong seal.

431
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,810
Seriously, women are so difficult to deal with.

432
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh man, I think I'm going to get sick.

433
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,290
Bu Ja, you came to visit.

434
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,730
I heard that you were severely injured. Is your body okay now?

435
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,890
Should I chill you a little bit more?

436
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,900
You... Something about you has really changed.

437
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,850
You're not Bu Ja, I see.

438
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,650
Long time no see, Winter General.

439
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,850
Who are you?

440
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,090
You don't recognize me?

441
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,090
How disappointing.

442
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,800
Then again, it's been over 1,000 years since we've seen each other, hasn't it?

443
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,780
I see that you two siblings are still sharing one body and living together.

444
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,320
Ah Sa Nyeo?

445
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,620
I met with your little sister.

446
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,550
I even got a lipstick as a gift from her.

447
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,550
You met with my sister?

448
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,360
She doesn't know anything about you.

449
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,610
Even though I'm the one who allowed her extinguished soul to survive by putting it in her brother's body.

450
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,030
Isn't it uncomfortable sharing your body with your sister?

451
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,940
I can take her soul out and cease her existence even if it's now.

452
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,690
Why did you come to see me?

453
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,690
You're going to need to help me now.

454
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,600
To start, I need to find the censer that I used before.

455
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,890
You're going to help me, right?

456
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,960
Ma Wang got beguiled by Ah Sa Nyeo? How?

457
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,830
He met Princess Iron Fan's ninth reincarnation.

458
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,910
That's why he has gotten impatient.

459
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,660
Ah Sa Nyeo is planning on doing something dangerous.

460
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,460
Please stop Ma Wang, Great Sage.

461
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:08,480
Then are you telling me that the solution Ah Sa Nyeo spoke of is possible?

462
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,420
It's possible, but it's too dangerous of a method.

463
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,290
As long as it's possible, that's enough.

464
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,470
Ma Wang, don't rush into anything.

465
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,080
Just continue working towards becoming a deity and wait for the time to come.

466
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,380
I've already waited 1,000 years.

467
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,550
If there's a way that's available to me right now,

468
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,470
then I'll do whatever it is.

469
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,580
That woman is Princess Iron Fan who committed a terrifying sin!

470
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,330
I'll pay the entire price for that crime.

471
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,200
Isn't that good enough then?!

472
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,260
I can't stop him. He said he was going to stick by the rules.

473
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,280
What do you want me to do?

474
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,460
So why do you only put me in charge of the ones here with bad tempers?! Why?!

475
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,530
Ma Wang's lover was originally a deity named Ja Eun.

476
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,570
What sort of crime did she commit?

477
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,800
She stole the souls of human children in order to save her own child.

478
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,860
I hereby sentence Princess Iron Fan to punishment.

479
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,560
Yes, sir!

480
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,850
Princess Iron Fan, you are now banished from the heavenly realm.

481
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,590
Ja Eun!

482
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,500
After that, for 1,000 years, she's been through 9 agonizing reincarnations.

483
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,360
How much does she still have left?

484
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,950
Out of 108, she's already gone through 9, so she has 99 more to go.

485
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,220
If she went through 9 lives in 1,000 years,

486
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,610
then it'll take more than 10,000 years for her to go through 99 lives.

487
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:21,240
Ma Wang intends to take on that 10,000 years worth of agony all at once.

488
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,100
Did Princess Iron Fan's child die?

489
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,730
It's possible that Ma Wang will die.

490
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,790
Sam Jang, give it a shot to try to stop him.

491
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,360
10,000 years of agony.

492
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,730
That's sure to hurt really bad.

493
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,650
I was roasted in the Bagua Crucible for 49 days,

494
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,930
but I bet that's going to hurt 1,200 times worse.

495
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,790
Don't make me scared.

496
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,890
You shouldn't do it.

497
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,360
I'm going to do it.

498
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,750
You trust Ah Sa Nyeo?

499
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,720
If she tricks me, then kill her.

500
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,750
You trust me?

501
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,380
You owe us a debt, don't you?

502
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:23,540
When we fought and broke up, she wanted to offer to make up

503
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,400
and sent Pachoseon through a deity that was acquainted with her.

504
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,860
If that thug of a deity

505
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:44,090
hadn't pocketed the fan, then we would have been able to make up.

506
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,520
Isn't that right?

507
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,930
I thought it would be fine if I took my time to take it to you.

508
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,850
How could I have known that she'd become Princess Iron Fan, get involved in an incident, and be kicked out of the heavenly realm in the meantime?

509
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,890
I was going to give it to you later, but then all of a sudden,

510
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,590
I got locked up in the Five Elements Mountain, and so I couldn't do so.

511
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:04,150
Whatever. Just repay that debt now.

512
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,510
Don't get in the way

513
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,960
and take care of the aftermath for me.

514
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,890
Do you really have to do this?

515
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,660
If it were you, would you not do it?

516
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:25,870
When there's a way,

517
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,180
would it be possible for you to not do it?

518
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,810
I wouldn't be able to resist doing it.

519
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,390
Hey! You, there!

520
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,710
Stop right there! Hey!

521
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,350
Who are you two?

522
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,950
We're here to get something. Please open the door.

523
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,110
Why you people! Are you kidding me—

524
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,810
Yes, I understand.

525
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,200
The door has opened.

526
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,400
It's there just as you said it would be.

527
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,670
Take it out.

528
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:49,710
You used that censer to put my sister's soul in me, didn't you?

529
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,610
It's because I can manipulate souls.

530
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,160
What do you intend to do with that censer this time?

531
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm going to switch souls this time.

532
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,650
Whose souls are you trying to switch?

533
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,040
Mine with Sam Jang's.

534
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,030
Ah Sa Nyeo.

535
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:21,050
In order to do that, I need to first put Sam Jang's blood in that censer and mix it with mine.

536
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,220
I should be able to get Sam Jang's blood if I use Ma Wang.

537
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,100
How nice it is that I'm getting to eat Sa Oh Jeong's homemade food for the first time in a while.

538
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,420
My my, you made my favorite mushroom porridge.

539
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,620
Hyungnim had me make it for you.

540
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,590
Why didn't you bring the nabak kimchi that Ma Wang likes?

541
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,690
It's not fully fermented yet.

542
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,760
If we wait until it becomes tasty, then he won't be able to taste it.

543
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,530
So that he can eat it before he goes, bring it quickly.

544
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,180
Okay.

545
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,250
What are you doing?

546
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,450
I can live until the nabak kimchi becomes tasty.

547
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,080
I won't die. What's with you?

548
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,420
You never know what will happen. Eat up and go.

549
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,790
You should have scheduled events today so what are you doing here?

550
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,150
Hyungnim Oh Gong told me to say farewell to you.

551
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,320
Are you going somewhere, Ma Wang?

552
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:44,130
It's true that I will be leaving, but I'll come back. I will definitely come back.

553
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,670
Right? Geez, he called me for no-good reason.

554
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,890
Pal Gye, just a moment.

555
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,690
I'll say this just in case.

556
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,090
Good work collecting all those energy beads all this time.

557
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,630
They're stashed in a safe, so if you need them, take and use them.

558
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,830
Secretary Ma knows the password

559
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,210
so instead of fighting, be friendly with each other and share them.

560
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,190
I can really take and use them?

561
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,600
That's right. You may go.

562
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,930
See ya.

563
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,570
Next.

564
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,660
What's this? Perhaps did the dragon sea palace contact you?

565
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,670
Go and say goodbye to Ma Wang.

566
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:46,320
Forget it! I don't need a farewell from you. Just go back to the dragon sea palace!

567
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,410
Ma Wang, is there anyone else you want to say goodbye to?

568
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,960
Why do you keep making me out to be like a bull on a slaughterhouse table? I'm not going to die!

569
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,070
Of course you're not going to die. But even so, we should say goodbye.

570
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:22,250
Ah, there's someone that you definitely need to see before you go, right?

571
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,750
I'll bring her to you. Just wait.

572
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,740
He's really enjoying this.

573
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,220
He's having the time of his life thinking that I'm going to die!

574
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,030
That thug! Nut job!

575
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,290
Why are those two acting like that?

576
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,260
Don't know.

577
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,490
You have a photo-shoot today, right? Let's go together.

578
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:51,190
I'm not going there. I'm going to go find Bu Ja's mother.

579
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,960
She's not Bu Ja anymore.

580
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,400
She's still Bu Ja! She's still my younger brother!

581
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,610
Don't you tell me too that she's not Bu Ja.

582
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,210
I'm sorry for pretending to be Bu Ja the other night.

583
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,710
I was testing you.

584
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,050
- For what?
- Your ability.

585
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:16,570
How is it possible that a special person like Sam Jang wasn't able to tell that a soul had changed?

586
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,670
I heard that you're a very capable priestess.

587
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,370
Because you're so strong, I see that you're protecting Bu Ja from rotting anymore.

588
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,930
Thank you. You're very amazing.

589
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,510
If you find it so amazing, then do you want to switch?

590
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,560
Your blood has the scent of lotus flowers.

591
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,190
However, my blood used to have a stronger scent of roses before.

592
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:43,850
Lotus fragrance and rose fragrance. Do you want to switch them?

593
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:48,240
There's something I learned to rub people the wrong way during times like this.

594
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:53,990
I don't want to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

595
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,190
Even if you give me ₩500, I won't switch with you.

596
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,720
Where did you learn that from?

597
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,950
Son Oh Gong. We're childish like that. Birds of a feather.

598
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,220
So don't think about butting in between a pair of two of a kind.

599
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:15,810
And as for abilities, I'll have you know that I woke up both Bu Ja and you, Ah Sa Nyeo, using my blood.

600
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,770
My blood also has a decent amount of power.

601
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:23,140
So I've no intent to exchange it.

602
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,520
This is the censer that disappeared from the museum not long ago.

603
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,420
This censer has the same dragon shape as the sarcophagus that you showed me.

604
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,380
It really is the same.

605
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:53,810
This is the woman who was caught on the CCTV camera when the censer disappeared.

606
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:15,190
Jeong Se Ra. It's that girl.

607
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:20,870
Like I thought, she didn't die and is still alive.

608
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,790
Bu Ja! Bu Ja! I found your mother! She's in the hospital right now.

609
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:38,090
Fortunately, she has someone helping her, so she's being treated right now. Let's go!

610
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,650
Ouch, my nose hurts...

611
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,430
You really are Bu Ja!

612
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,920
Have you any idea how scared I was thinking that you were really gone?

613
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,000
What a relief.

614
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,130
- I'm—
- Don't tell me you're not!

615
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,240
I know that you're Ah Sa Nyeo, but Bu Ja's still in there, too.

616
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,540
So don't speak like Bu Ja's gone.

617
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,870
I'll go and meet your mother first by myself.

618
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,930
Let's go together next time.

619
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:41,570
Such a pain. I need to quickly change bodies and get rid of this Bu Ja girl's body.

620
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,340
Today's the day.

621
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:56,800
This is the last day of her ninth life.

622
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,690
I'm all ready.

623
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,610
I just need you to prepare one thing for me, Ma Wang.

624
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,410
- What is it?
- Sam Jang's blood.

625
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,260
Since this body isn't mine, the power of my blood is weak.

626
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,990
If I mix my blood with Sam Jang's, I think it will work.

627
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:25,560
Let me put Sam Jang's blood in this censer.

628

[CEO Jin Seon Mi]

629
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,650
Ma Wang, what brings you here?

630
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:52,160
I came here like this because I have a favor to ask of you.

631
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:58,410
Sam Jang, come with me. There is someone I must show you.

632
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,960
So this is who that person is.

633
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,390
Welcome.

634
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,740
Are you looking for something?

635
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,530
I'll just take a look around.

636
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,860
There was a grim reaper next to her.

637
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,570
Is she going to die today?

638
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,760
That's right.

639
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,530
In each of her incarnations, she lives the same amount of time and dies.

640
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:32,200
Today is the last day of her ninth reincarnation.

641
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,220
Then are you telling me to get rid of that grim reaper to prevent her from dying?

642
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,290
It's not possible to get rid of a grim reaper.

643
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,080
I know.

644
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,580
She's going to die today. That's not something we can prevent.

645
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:58,470
But I've found a method to end her pain of eternal cycle of death and rebirth with this as her last one.

646
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,460
I heard that's something very dangerous for you.

647
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:05,010
I have to do it. Please help me, Sam Jang.

648
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,890
What do you need me to do?

649
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:12,430
I need your blood.

650
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:27,900
Winter General, now I'm going to be able to mix my blood with Sam Jang's soon.

651
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:32,040
Once I go into Sam Jang's body, I'll become far stronger than I was in the past.

652
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,040
What are you going to do with Son Oh Gong?

653
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,800
I'm going to take over that woman's body and marry him.

654
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,560
The priestess can manipulate the stars?

655
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:48,050
Yes, it is said that she can read people's destinies.

656
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,180
If Ah Sa Nyeo collects all of the destinies that Princess Iron Fan was supposed to receive as punishment

657
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,980
and pours them onto Ma Wang, then it might be possible.

658
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,070
So her deal with Ma Wang wasn't a lie after all.

659
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,140
- She can also manipulate souls.
- Yeah.

660
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,860
She bragged about that to me herself.

661
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:12,090
She's capable of transferring a soul to somewhere else.

662
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,660
Transfer a soul?

663
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:22,860
Yes. It's possible for her to do so by mixing blood.

664
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:34,470
The number of remaining reincarnations for Princess Iron Fan is 99.

665
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:40,450
So what I have to do is be hit with the punishment of the remaining 99 destinies?

666
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:45,110
Yes, I will bring forth the energy from the stars.

667
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,210
The energy of the stars will fall upon you like arrows.

668
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,600
Ma Wang, you have to receive the punishment with your body.

669
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:04,180
First, we need to prepare the censer.

670
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:06,980
Please give me Sam Jang's blood.

671
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:43,850
Now, I will mix in my own blood.

672
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,100
Nice catch.

673
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,420
Why are you doing this?

674
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,040
What are you doing? Didn't I tell you not to interfere?

675
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,490
She was acting too suspiciously.

676
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:13,430
Why does your blood need to be mixed in when your blood has no power right now?

677
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,560
If you interfere like this, then I can't do it.

678
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,490
Then we don't need you here. Get out.

679
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,710
Leave this here. Sam Jang's blood is already in it.

680
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,380
What are you doing right now? I told you not to interfere.

681
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,380
I'm not interfering. Continue.

682
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,040
You made the priestess leave!

683
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,530
Sam Jang can do it.

684
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:59,850
- What?
- Me?

685
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:03,030
- I can't do it.
- You can.

686
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,110
Elder Soo Bo Ri said you can do it too.

687
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,640
Sam Jang is a more powerful priestess than Ah Sa Nyeo,

688
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,630
so she can do it.

689
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,510
Fine, then call Elder Soo Bo Ri here to confirm.

690
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:21,010
He went to go get someone. He'll be here soon.

691
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,270
Wait!

692
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,010
Back off for now.

693
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,500
I am Elder Soo Bo Ri.

694
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,390
I should be able to postpone it for a few hours with my power.

695
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,560
Seo Yoon Hee, stop what you're doing.

696
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,030
There is someone you should meet for a second.

697
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,650
Mind your own business and move aside.

698

For that person, just 10 minutes.

You must bring her, okay?
