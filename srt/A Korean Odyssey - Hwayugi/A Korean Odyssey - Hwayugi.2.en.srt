[Episode 2]
I found it! I found it!

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,110
There it is! I came first.

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,490
I came here first.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,700
- What the heck...
- What...

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,330
Jin Seon Mi. Move!

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,060
She touched our tree.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,170
It's going to have bad luck.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,250
My mom said if something has bad luck, I should do this.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,640
Hey, hey. Let's just go play somewhere else.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,090
Okay. Let's go.

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,130
I'm sorry. Because I touched you, the kids don't want to be around you anymore.

15
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,770
Hey. Play with me.

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,060
Unni, did you call me?

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,070
You have a good scent to you. Come play with me.

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,190
Here.

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,840
She's my granddaughter! Let go!

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,350
My puppy, are you okay?

21
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,600
You could've been hurt badly.

22
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,930
From now on, always be careful so you don't bleed.

23
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,080
Grandma, do I always have to hide by myself?

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,610
No, someone is going to appear to protect my puppy.

25
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,650
Until then, our Seon Mi, you have to live well with courage.

26
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,290
Since that person's fate is to protect you.

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,820
Let's see.

28
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,320
You need to bandage yourself well.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,530
If they smell your blood, they will keep coming.

30
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,360
So because I'm Sam Jang,

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,690
evil spirits will smell my blood and keep coming?

32
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,450
Yes.

33
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,710
- You too?
- I originally came to eat Sam Jang.

34
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,570
But after seeing your face, I was surprised.

35
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,470
How can I eat someone I know?

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,430
Anyway, thank you for protecting me earlier.

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,500
Do we have an ordinary relationship? It's an unforgettably ardent one of 25 years.

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,290
You said you haven't even thought of me once.

39
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,780
Would that be the truth? I was just pretending to be tough.

40
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,670
From now on, there will be progressively more evil spirits swarming Sam Jang.

41
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,990
This won't do.

42
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,710
I didn't want to be bothered, so I was going to ignore it.

43
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,930
But now, I think I really need to protect you.

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,960
Let's redo our contract.

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,550
Let's forget about that old contract from 25 years ago and make a new, proper one.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,810
Then first, we'll annul our old contract. Agree?

47
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:37,510
What? We're not playing rock, paper, scissors. We're making a contract!

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,880
Do you think I aged 25 years for nothing?

49
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,340
You're trying to trick me into annulling the old contract, aren't you?

50
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,730
Why? You want to eat me up too, but because of the old contract you can't?

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,180
That's right. Among those who are trying to eat you aggressively, I'm the strongest predator.

52
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,500
Jin Seon Mi, I mean, Sam Jang.

53
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,530
Just choose to get eaten up by me.

54
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,610
If you can eat me, try it!

55
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,390
You... you really want me to try?

56
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,600
Stubborn wench.

57
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,350
Weirdly enough, the Great Sage didn't eat up Sam Jang right away.

58
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,610
He's usually the type to eat, once he sets his mind to it.

59
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,890
I think either he feels too guilty to eat her up so quickly...

60
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,760
or there's something which is making him hesitate.

61
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,880
There is something.

62
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,220
Were you really going to eat me if we didn't have that contract?

63
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,140
At what point exactly did you catch on? I was acting perfectly.

64
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,180
I was suspicious from the moment you started acting kind.

65
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,110
That's too bad.

66
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,440
Although I didn't call you because I don't know your name,

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,490
how could you think of gobbling a child whom you promised to protect?

68
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,780
Even if it weren't me, you would eventually be caught and eaten by another evil spirit.

69
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,830
Because you're Sam Jang.

70
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,760
"Sam Jang." What in the world is that exactly?

71
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,190
What is Sam Jang?

72
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,440
Sam Jang is a human with noble blood who has received the royal vocation of Heaven.

73
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,860
It's said that before the big disarrangement occurs in the human world, he would appear.

74
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,630
But you're saying the girl who released the Great Sage is Sam Jang?

75
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,500
As punishment for releasing Oh Gong,

76
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,720
I heard she received Sam Jang's fate.

77
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,060
But strictly speaking, you could say that

78
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,730
I am partially responsible for changing her fate.

79
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,960
So, as per Elder Soo Bo Ri's request,

80
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
are you intending to protect her?

81
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,460
But the scent of Sam Jang's blood is

82
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,310
extremely seductive.

83
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,660
The scent of her blood made me realize

84
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,140
that I am a demon for the first time in a thousand years.

85
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,200
I think it'll be too dangerous to keep her close to me.

86
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,220
Then stay away from her.

87
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,930
Anyway, at least I can resist it through the power of asceticism,

88
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,850
but how is the Great Sage able to resist it?

89
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,810
Son Oh Gong is also a demon, right?

90
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,270
If we consider all the facts, the Great Sage is already a deity.

91
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,060
He may have been kicked out of Heaven, but a deity is on another level from a demon.

92
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,580
If you're having a hard time resisting, should I go catch Sam Jang and bring her? Would you like to eat her?

93
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,230
Never mind. I told you I'm in the midst of practicing asceticism.

94
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:34,780
I, too, should try that ama—zing

95
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,420
act of being a deity.

96
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,350
You may go.

97
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,930
Then Sam Jang is a dangerous thing.

98
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,530
From now one, more and more things will swarm and try to pounce on you.

99
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,330
It'll be harder and harder to survive.

100
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,420
So that's why I'm saying this. Can't you just say that you give up on this lifetime?

101
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,610
- What?
- It looks like this lifetime is already ruined by normal human standards anyway.

102
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,330
It's a bit drab anyway since you see ghosts and don't have any friends.

103
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,450
How about ending this lifetime at about this point and waiting for your next one?

104
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,990
- What?
- If you say that you give up on this lifetime

105
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,580
and therefore the contract is null and void, I'll eat you without causing any pain.

106
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,590
Since we know each other, wouldn't I be the most comfortable for you?

107
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,470
- What?
- I mean,

108
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,660
instead of ending your life while living anxiously not knowing when and what's going to pop out and eat you,

109
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,120
whether it be after a week or half a month of having my protection,

110
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,230
I'm saying I'll give you the chance to choose the time you want to put an end to your life.

111
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,520
I don't need that kind of a chance.

112
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,160
It's not like I've only seen ghosts for a day or two. There's no reason for me to feel anxious.

113
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,280
I can never give up on this lifetime.

114
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,570
I'm going to keep aging and live on until I'm all wrinkled!

115
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,420
Ah, because of that contract, it's all ruined.

116
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,720
But how did she become Sam Jang?

117
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,170
What if I had fallen for that lie that he was going to protect me? Jerk.

118
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,410
Let go. Let go!

119
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,480
Go away! Go away! Go away!

120
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,510
Evil spirit.

121
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,420
Get lost!

122
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,520
You got bitten again. Why do you keep going around getting bitten? So gross.

123
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,430
What was that just now?

124
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,660
It's an evil spirit that was trying to eat you. Now do you believe me?

125
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
You've lost your mind.

126
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,860
Then can I assume you've given up on this lifetime and eat you?

127
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,100
So this is my end.

128
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,400
I really am cursed.

129
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,600
Unfortunate things always happened to me,

130
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,490
and everyone I loved became unhappy.

131
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,610
So I had accepted that either I'd get killed by a serial killer

132
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,550
or die an untimely death from a car accident.

133
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,920
But in the end, I get eaten by an evil spirit like this.

134
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,790
You've made up your mind? It's best that I eat you, right?

135
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,730
I only have you. You can keep protecting me like you just did.

136
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,550
I was only protecting my prey.

137
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,920
But we even made a contract.

138
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,380
But you don't even know my name.

139
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,070
My offer, think about it carefully.

140
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,310
I'll give you 15 days, so make a decision.

141
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,350
Jerk...

142
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,400
Hey.

143
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,870
You should take your umbrella.

144
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,960
Coat. Don't hang it on my bull statue.

145
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,510
If something like this is hung on it again, I'm going to throw it out.

146
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,450
Why would you throw out that statue when it's perfect for a coat rack?

147
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,950
Not my precious bull statue, but your coat will be thrown out.

148
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,280
Hang it on there one more time and I'll burn this.

149
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,270
Gosh, why would you throw out something perfectly fine? You need to conserve things to live well.

150
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,090
So with a spirit of thrift,

151
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,230
is that why you're sewing together a torn-up umbrella?

152
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,650
This is Sam Jang's. I found Sam Jang today.

153
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:30,510
Is that so? I won't care whether or not you eat it as long as it's after you leave my house.

154
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,750
Sam Jang is that little girl. The one that you sent to the Five Elements Mountain.

155
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,570
So?

156
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,840
- You knew this?
- Of course.

That human girl Jin Seon Mi is Sam Jang.

158
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,790
Since when did you know?

159
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,940
By chance, did you know that child was Sam Jang from the beginning and cast her by sending her to Five Elements Mountains?

160
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,560
What do you mean?

161
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,100
Because she went in there and set you free, she became Sam Jang.

162
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,770
As punishment for setting you free, she was destined to become Sam Jang.

163
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,040
So that's what happened.

164
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,990
Anyway, why aren't you eating Sam Jang right away?

165
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,030
There's no way you're sparing her for repaying her kindness. Is there any other reason?

166
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,670
I fixed everything already.

167
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,410
By chance, are you actually feeling guilty to her so that's why you're letting her go and not eating her?

168
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,440
- It must be done now.
- What is it?

169
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,830
Hey, what is this smell?

170
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,580
I invented some sauce.

171
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,750
Sauce?

172
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,690
Hey, by chance, sauce to season on Sam Jang for eating?

173
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,770
I have somewhere to go so watch the fire for me.

174
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,790
All you need to do is put the fire out after 20 minutes and leave it uncovered.

♫ I'm alone now

316
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,270
Ugh, come to your senses!

317
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,540
If I help you, will you trade umbrellas with me?

318
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,460
No! I can't! I have to judge properly! No!

319
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,790
This fragrance! Oh this fragrance!

320
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,570
You...

321
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,710
pass!

322
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,010
Great Sage, what happened to Sam Jang?

323
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,970
I'm in the middle of persuading her so I can eat her without anything going wrong.

324
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,260
I created a sauce. Later on, taste it for me, Winter General.

325
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,750
The weather is really cold. Hey!

326
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,360
Oppa!

327
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,060
Everyone, how many meters is the manner distance between artist and fans? Ten meters?

328
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,220
Ten meters!

329
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,870
Let's maintain that invisible line.

330
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,920
Oppa! Oppa!

331
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,680
Yo! Son brother! Long time no see.

332
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,730
How are you?

333
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,870
- Yo, pig!
- Yeah.

334
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,280
- Enough with the talk.
- I'm sorry.

335
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,390
So you caught Sam Jang?

336
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,380
Congratulations, Hyungnim!

337
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,190
Well, I ended up finding out.

338
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,520
I won't tell anyone so give me just one bite.

339
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,260
Hey, you're already full from the energy of these yapping little girls who give it to you voluntarily.

340
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,200
Butt out of it.

341
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,800
Sam Jang is special.

342
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,390
They said the smell of her blood was really entrancing.

343
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,240
- What did you think of it, Hyungnim?
- Great Sage hasn't had any yet.

344
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,630
What? Are you training to be a deity like Woo Ma Wang?

345
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,080
You almost became a deity, but you were kicked out to Five Elements Mountain.

346
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,430
What's so great about that for you to start over?

347
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,730
Winter General, what do you call a pig that got squished?

348
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,990
Ah, pyeonyook.
(A dish which consists of thinly sliced meat that has been boiled and pressed)

349
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,930
Hyungnim, you have Sam Jang, and with her power,

350
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,900
please become Heaven's Son Oh Gong again.

351
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,170
He never grows up. Geez.

352
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,020
Seeing that Jeo Pal Gye came all the way here, Sam Jang must be a big deal.

353
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,720
Yeah. All kinds of evil spirits kept getting in the way because of the smell of her blood.

354
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,490
It was bothersome protecting her all through the night.

355
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,490
You protected Sam Jang all night long?

356
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,890
Yeah. Because she's my prey.

357
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,050
And you don't need to protect that prey right now?

358
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,690
She probably went to Woo Ma Wang to find out my name.

359
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,300
Woo Ma Wang won't eat her so she's safe.

360
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,500
Please tell me his name. I must know that rascal's name.

361
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,440
Unfortunately, even if I let you know that Son Oh Gong is Son Oh Gong,

362
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,220
you can't remember the name.

363
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,960
What did I just say his name was?

364
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,420
His name is... I just heard it.

365
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,450
See that?

366
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,540
Even if you hear it, it can't remain in your memory.

367
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,770
Until Son Oh Gong returns the memory he took from you.

368
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,460
Then, I can never call that rascal's name?

369
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,470
It's unfortunate. Then please be on your way.

370
00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:00,300
Then the contract is also useless and I have to be eaten up by him or demons?

371
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,840
- What do you mean by contract?
- We agreed upon a contract!

372
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,790
If I call his name, he will show up and protect me.

373
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:12,080
A contract? That's what was bothering him.

374
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,840
No wonder that rascal couldn't eat you up right away.

375
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,660
But still, since I don't know his name, I can't call him. So it's no use.

376
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,700
He may have used a cunning trick but a contract with a human is very strong.

377
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,480
I'll help you.

378
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,130
Let's look for something to catch Son Oh Gong.

379
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,400
One moment!

380
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,770
By any chance, you wouldn't ask me to go through this path alone to fetch something like last time, right?

381
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,460
This time, let's go together so there are no accidents.

382
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,510
I believe it was around here.

383
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,350
Ah, Pirun-dong building 28. We found the place well.

384
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,040
What do they do here?

385
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,290
It says so here. General Store.

386
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:48,090
The item we're looking for should be here.

387
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,230
Welcome.

388
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,290
Welcome, Ma Wang!

389
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,860
We were waiting for you.

390
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,460
Have you been well? It's been a long time, peddler.

391
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,680
Why, he used to be this little...

392
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,250
Your grandson grew up a lot!

393
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,240
I'm in the middle of teaching him.

394
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,930
This is the Mi Hon fragrance that you've been looking for.

395
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,630
Will I be able to make that nut job a bit docile with this?

396
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,340
For taming fierce demons,

397
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,380
I have something amazing that this doesn't compare to. Would you like to see it?

398
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,860
If you have such an amazing item, of course I must see it.

399
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,370
Please wait.

400
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,540
What could be in a place like this?

401
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,820
Ouch! I said it hurts!

402
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,310
It bites. Be careful.

403
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,750
It's me and that rascal.

404
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,230
What is this jar?

405
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,890
It's a jar that shows unfortunate incidents in advance.

406
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:58,380
What you see there always happens eventually, but it isn't always good.

407
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,180
Please don't touch anything.

408
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,020
An unfortunate incident?

409
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,020
I think we unexpectedly acquired a good item.

410
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,130
It's called Geumganggo.

411
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,350
Geumganggo?

412
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,250
- Come in.
- Why?

413
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,580
- Hurry up and come!
- What's the matter?

414
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,620
I did the wallpaper and linoleum by myself!

415
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,780
- Really?
- Hurry up and come!

416
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,430
Ta da!

417
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:48,200
It's so awesome! By the time we get back from our honeymoon, the furniture will already be here.

418
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,820
That's right. All that's left is our wedding tomorrow.

419
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,860
- I love you!
- Me too!

420
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:03,080
But what's that? What could it be?

421
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,990
This is an old picture. But who put it here?

422
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,850
The studio must have made a mistake in the delivery.

423
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,790
- Alright, I'll take care of it so don't worry.
- Okay.

424
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,140
Shall we check out the bedroom?

425
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,990
The bedroom? Why suddenly the bedroom?

426
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,460
Our baby? Go inside!

427
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,090
Meet me in the bedroom!

428
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,530
Where did I put it earlier?

429
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,280
Where did I put my bag?

430
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,620
Ah! Here it is!

431
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,410
That's strange.

432
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,570
Earlier, I think the woman had her eyes lowered.

433
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,170
Do you want to get married instead of me?

434
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,990
They say a bride-eating evil spirit is running loose recently.

435
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,920
I think it's the work of a pretty strong evil spirit.

436
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,680
Evil spirit?

437
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
In the past, it was either a drawing or a mirror.

438
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Now, it's a photo or video? They attach themselves to these things.

439
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,870
Anyway, now that worldly demons are gradually becoming more prevalent,

440
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,740
that's why the heavenly world sent down Sam Jang.

441
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,450
Are you saying Sam Jang came to this world because of demons?

442
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,150
Sam Jang is a human who holds the vocation

443
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,470
to protect the world from demons.

444
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:59,280
With what power does a human Sam Jang fight demons?

445
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
They don't send down Sam Jang from above without a countermeasure.

446
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,800
The big picture is already determined.

447
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,350
What is supposed to happen will happen.

448
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,330
It's cold!

449
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,550
Where are you returning from?

450
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,800
Shopping. I want to use up all my money before I die.

451
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,440
Shopping?

452
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,980
You went to Woo Ma Wang!

453
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,810
I heard you danced and sang. How dare you lie to me?

454
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,630
Do you want to die?!

455
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,630
Fine! I lied!

456
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,020
I asked your name but he said even if he told me I wouldn't be able to remember it.

457
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,730
See? I told you that you can never remember it.

458
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,660
Why won't you believe me and make a useless trip?

459
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,400
How can I believe you?

460
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,570
Close your eyes here.

461
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,940
You want me to die now?
("Die" and "close eyes" are homophones.)

462
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,730
No. Just cover those eyeballs.

463
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,470
You have to cover your eyeballs so I can say "Ta da!"

464
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,740
W-what is "Ta-da?"

465
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,330
Ta da!

466
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,090
For the comfort of the limited time you have, I went through some trouble.

467
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,830
Now then, how about choosing me?

468
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,780
Are you doing this to brown-nose me?

469
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,470
Fine, according to you I have to die anyway. I wonder if getting eaten by you is the best choice.

470
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:03,030
Of course. A friendly predator like me doesn't exist.

471
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,220
Then try a bit harder.

472
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,270
You have to make me not have any regrets about dying so that I start to have thoughts of dying.

473
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,190
Okay, I understand. What do you want? I'll do everything.

474
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,930
What haven't you done?

475
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:25,340
Having dinner together with family, having drinks with friends,

476
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,220
and going on a date with a boyfriend.

477
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,400
Your present.

478
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,130
- Have a delicious meal.
- Shall we eat chicken?

479
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:42,460
Let's eat like a family. Should I be the oppa or do you want to be the noona?

480
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,370
I always wanted to order the family set.

481
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,900
Oh, family.

482
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,970
Uncle, I can order, right?

483
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,980
As much as you want. Order the most abundant amount so we won't lose to other families.

484
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,450
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

485
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,640
Cheers!

486
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,520
Hey, this is totally delicious. Why didn't we come here earlier?

487
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,750
I've never said cheers or drank with another person before.

488
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:18,610
Sadly, I'm currently banned from drinking but I'll do a toast with you as often as you like.

489
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,980
Shall I be your colleague or friend?

490
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,350
I want you to be a colleague, best friend, then someone who is flirting with me.

491
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,330
Flirting... Okay.

492
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,330
Jin Seon Mi, as I see it, you need to go to the army.

493
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,640
The only place that will change your introverted personality in one go is the army.

494
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,220
Ah, I see.

495
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,150
The toughness and mental strength gained through training between a senior and his predecessor,

496
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,760
and through personal interactions,

497
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,300
will change your introverted personality into an outgoing one in one blow.

498
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,040
Also, you said you see ghosts, right?

499
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,770
You have to go to the army so that ability goes away.

500
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,130
Want to know why? The army has so many things scarier than ghosts.

501
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,460
Hey, hey, hey! Right now, you don't have enough respect for the army!

502
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,270
Because I'm your best friend, I can advise you about going to the army or not!

503
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:21,990
Geez. There's no place like the army. You really have to go there to know.

504
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,330
♫ My heart beats because of your stare ♫

505
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:47,000
♫ Because of your gestures ♫

506
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,910
♫ I'm getting tossed and turned ♫

507
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,050
♫ At your words, I lose my strength ♫

508
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,170
Wow! The tree is really pretty.

509
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,320
You should also take photos like them.

510
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,530
You didn't bring your cellphone? Should I get you one?

511
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,890
My younger brother manufactures those cellphones. He's the top executive of his company.

512
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,450
He'll probably bring the newest model that hasn't even been launched yet.

513
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,140
Whatever I need, I just need to tell him.

514
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,050
Forget it. I also have my own.

515
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,630
♫ To me, you become love ♫

516
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,280
Everyone is posing like this. You should also try it once before you die.

517
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,280
Take a photo.

518
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,180
♫ I will always be by your side ♫

519
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,980
Well, we don't have to do stuff like this.

520
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,320
With good intentions, I gave you a chance to give it a try before you die.

521
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,760
If you don't want to, forget it.

522
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,490
I've never been outside with someone during the holidays.

523
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,580
It's really nice.

524
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,640
I didn't know they decorated the tree this beautifully.

525
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,440
Well then, I've done my part.

526
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,710
You should start slowly preparing your heart.

527
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,970
Oh! It's beautiful!

528
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,400
The tree was beautiful so why did you turn off the lights?

529
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,920
Everyone is leaving!

530
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,950
What are you going to do if they leave?

531
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,610
Those people aren't your family, friends, or lover.

532
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:51,580
You are the only one left alone without anyone.

533
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,510
Doesn't your life appear more lonely and miserable after something that twinkled got turned off?

534
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:04,390
Using words that humans these days use often, doesn't it seem like this life is ruined?

535
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,560
What do you think?

536
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,020
It's the perfect moment to make the decision to die.

537
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,550
Even though I don't have family, friends, or a lover,

538
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,750
in my life, there's me.

539
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:31,360
Although I'm alone and live well, I'm more affectionate and proud of myself.

540
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,090
I want to continue living.

541
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,130
That's why I need you.

542
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,630
I have no need for you who wants to continue living.

543
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,140
Forget it. Just for today, being your family, friend, and lover...

544
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,010
I'm satisfied with trying to please you.

545
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,510
Still, I was thankful for today.

546
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,650
Here. It's a present.

547
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,090
What is it?

548
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:14,520
I bought it there earlier. This is also something I wanted to do.

549
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,070
Giving and receiving gifts is something I've never done before.

550
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,040
Take it.

551
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,170
This is called Geumganggo.

552
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,600
If you place this on him, you can keep him tied down by your side.

553
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,450
In case he refuses, it will give him pain equivalent of his heart being torn to shreds.

554
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,520
What trick are you trying to play?

555
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,500
It's my first time giving someone a gift so I wanted to try it.

556
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,120
You said you'd do everything for me. If you don't want it, give it to me.

557
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,200
You said it's mine. For now, it's accepted.

558
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,320
Well, whether you throw it out or not, do as you please.

559
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,660
Today, I can't make up my mind.

560
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,440
Because I spent it with you, it was the most enjoyable Christmas Eve of my life.

561
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,970
- What?
- You didn't know? Today's Christmas Eve.

562
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:44,240
That's why families, friends, and lovers came out together.

563
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,410
Thanks for coming out together with me.

564
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:56,510
Giving up on this life is something I don't want to do today.

565
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:05,570
Okay! I said I'd give you up to 15 days so I'll let today pass.

566
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,070
Go!

♫ Always behind of you ♫

578
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,320
In the act! I've caught you red-handed.

579
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,640
I told you not to hang it here again, didn't I?

580
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,530
I said I would definitely burn it, right?

581
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,710
Sorry. If you want to burn it, go ahead.

582
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:30,150
I will burn it right in front of your eyes. Watch carefully!

583
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,910
Hey, Great Sage!

584
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:54,310
By any chance, before I burn it, is there anything important in your pocket?

585
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,180
No, just burn it.

586
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,920
I'll give you the opportunity so take it.

587
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,770
Ma Wang, burn it so you'll relieve your anger. I have many.

588
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,200
Next time, if you hang it there again, I'll really light it on fire.

589
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,390
No, burn it!

590
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,770
Why burn something that has nothing wrong with it? You have to save to live well!

591
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,410
I will hang it in your room.

592
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:19,170
Ma Wang, have you ever seen a human

593
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,270
who doesn't seem to have anything going for them

594
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,360
want to protect their life preciously?

595
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,730
I see it often.

596
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,480
The looks in the eyes of the kids who are on my audition program are like that.

597
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,890
Of course, among those kids, the majority lose that look in their eyes. Why?

598
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:44,000
That look of wanting to live... it was cool.

599
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,870
So? You want to protect that look in her eyes?

600
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,320
Ma Wang, did you burn it?

601
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,110
I didn't burn it.

602
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,320
Not that! My sauce! I told you to turn off the stove for me!

603
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,060
Geez, it came out totally delicious this time!

604
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,160
What were you doing instead of looking after that? Gosh, seriously!

605
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,620
Damn it! I couldn't put Geumganggo on him!

606
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,980
I paid a lot to buy this!

607
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:42,540
If there is any way to contain that nut job again, how nice it would be!

608
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:48,750
Ma Wang! Ma Wang! You can't burn that!

609
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,760
Wow, there's a really important thing in here. I almost forgot!

610
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:58,870
Oh, really? See? I told you to take it. Good thing I didn't burn it.

611
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,370
- Thanks!
- No need for thanks.

612
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:07,900
Please put on the Geumganggo, please!

613
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:14,070
Geumganggo will eventually go where it has to go.

614
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,110
What is supposed to happen will happen.

615
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,450
The standards for the first half of next year will be considerable.

616
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:47,750
- Alright.
- Also, diligently work on raising the expectations...

617
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,950
That's right.

618
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,570
Hyungnim.

619
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,250
Oh.

620
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,040
What brings you all the way here?

621
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,860
I have an urgent matter.

622
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,910
Oh, I see.

623
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,510
- Let's go in.
- Yes.

624
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,270
Hey, you made a nice cellphone. Even the pen pops out.

625
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,790
Thank you. I paid some extra attention to it.

626
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,640
Nice.

627
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,600
Work hard.

628
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,240
- It's this way, Hyungnim.
- Okay.

629
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,590
Pardon? You want to destroy a contract you made with a human?

630
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,810
Yeah. It's been concerning me and getting bothersome.

631
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,930
By any chance, is the human whom you made the contract with Sam Jang?

632
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:49,510
Yeah. While coming out of Five Elements Mountain, I made a bothersome contract.

633
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,570
For starters, I'll make arrangements for a competent lawyer.

634
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,900
Why don't you privately get advice?

635
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:06,850
Also, I'll make sure to find information about that bracelet.

636
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,070
But who gave it to you?

637
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:14,540
Sam Jang. She said it's a Christmas gift.

638
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,000
Today is the 15th day. Did he put on the Geumganggo?

639
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,260
Please have some.

640
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,720
It's very cold outside, isn't it?

641
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,790
We weren't able to hold the wedding ceremony

642
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,070
so we won't be needing the house either.

643
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,660
Oh my, what should we do about this?

644
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,820
If you break the contract now, you will also lose the deposit.

645
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,780
I don't ever want to go into that house again.

646
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,710
Please cancel the contract.

647
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,660
But still, I think it would be better to reconsider...

648
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,700
Chairman!

649
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,320
What accident could have happened in such an empty house?

650
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,360
There isn't anything wrong with it. Why would the bride be sick?

651
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,070
Is the floor slippery?

652
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,420
It's fine.

653
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,950
It's an old wedding photo.

654
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,830
It was you.

655
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,850
CEO? Wow... the house has no flaws.

656
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,900
It's very well built. CEO?

657
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,970
CEO?

658
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,670
Our CEO... has disappeared again.

659
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,790
Ugh. My job is so hard.

660
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,980
- Hey.
- Oh my God!

661
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,850
Where's Jin Seon Mi?

662
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,830
Who are you?

663
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:44,540
I have something to get from the CEO here. It's due today. Where did she go?

664
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,060
I don't know... sir.

665
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:03,300
She went to see a property and suddenly disappeared.

666
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,920
That kind of thing happens to her frequently.

667
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,080
Yes, hello? This is Hanbit Real Estate.

668
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,460
There's a newlywed couple's portrait left in the Oh Seong Apartment.

669
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,830
I have it in our office so please come and take it.

670
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,890
Hold on a second. Hey! Hey! Why are you taking that? Hey!

671
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,120
Hello! This is your worldwide handsome PK.

672
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:42,040
I'm sincerely thankful for all your love and support on my last Asia tour.

673
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,740
That's right! You successfully finished your Asia tour!

674
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,430
And now you're going on your South America tour, right?

675
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,940
Wow. There's nothing you don't know!

676
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:58,200
Yes. Thinking of meeting those passionate South American fans

677
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,490
already makes me so excited!

678
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,300
I'm excited.

679
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,060
Just a moment!

680
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,570
Ah, this? The bride is not a demon,

681
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,860
but the groom is a horny demon.

682
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,480
Since he is your kind, you know him, right? How do I get in?

683
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,910
You want to go in? What if you can't get out?

684
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,560
You seriously never answer at once, do you?

685
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,030
Just tell me where I can enter.

686
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,660
So there's still the house where this marriage happened.

687
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,970
Go there and go into the picture.

688
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,230
The flower palanquin is coming in!

689
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:38,670
The flower palanquin is coming in! The flower palanquin! The bride is entering! The bride!

690
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,960
Hurry and bring it here!

691
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,160
There will be 7 brides coming into this house today!

692
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,770
Oh my... how can there be seven brides?

693
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:54,950
What a celebration! I'll have to go check out the brides.

694
01:00:54,950 --> 01:01:00,900
He brought in 7 of them? What a greedy, horny demon.

695
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,240
The marriage will start!

696
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:30,080
The marriage is starting!

697
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:35,650
- With seven of them, how can I tell which is which?
- Excuse me. I'll pass by.

698
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,770
Excuse me.

699
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,320
Someone strange appeared! He is not from this town!

700
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,880
There's a strange person! Hurry!

701
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,610
- He is not from this town!
- What's the problem?!

702
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:50,150
Someone strange appeared. He is not from our town.

703
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,890
- Bring him.
- Yes, sir.

704
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:08,040
- How did you come in here?
- Was it you? The horny demon who brought those women?

705
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,410
This is a world I created!

706
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:13,470
If you hurt me here, this world will collapse

707
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:17,630
and you and those brides won't be able to go back.

708
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:21,210
I'm not interested in you. I just have to take the person I'm looking for.

709
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,380
Why? Is she your bride?

710
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,640
Fine. If she's already married, I will send her off.

711
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,700
In exchange, find your bride on your own.

712
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:39,090
But if you are wrong, you have to go back alone quietly.

713
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,140
Find her!

714
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,660
Find her from there.

715
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:03,270
Geez. They are all the same. I can't just take a guess... What to do?

716
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,370
Find the scent of the lotus flower.

717
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,420
Second person in the first row.

718
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,540
Bring her here.

719
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,350
- Show her face.
- Yes, sir.

720
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:18,580
I was right. It's a relief that you carry a scent. I'm taking her.

721
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:22,930
Hold it! How do I know if you are the groom?

722
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,290
I have to ask the bride.

723
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,690
Is he your groom?

724
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:37,210
Jin Seon Mi! Look at me! We have to go!

725
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:40,300
Come to your senses! Jin Seon Mi!

726
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,960
She's not your bride. Take her back.

727
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,030
- Yes, sir!
- Hold it!

728
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,730
Jin Seon Mi! Look at this. You know this, right?

729
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,550
It's a present you bought for me.

730
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,460
You said this is the first present you ever bought someone.

731
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,180
Look.

732
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,610
Take my hand.

733
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,510
Take her out.

734
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:53,000
What is this? Where is this?

735
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,640
Hey. You came to your senses?

736
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,250
Fairy?

737
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,000
Let's go.

738
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:04,700
What is this smell?

739
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:10,070
There was a woman with this good scent? I can't give her to you!

740
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,750
Run!

741
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,950
Wait. This way.

742
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,960
Hey, let's go back this way.

743
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,140
What just happened anyway?

744
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,750
You were captured by the horny demon and were about to get married him.

745
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:56,140
But are we out of the picture?

746
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,010
They are over there! Everyone, come this way!

747
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:00,400
Shit! We are still not out.

748
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,140
Run!

749
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,170
Ai-ya...

750
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:14,740
Geez.

751
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,570
Ma... Ma Wang?

752
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,450
Are you the one who closed the entrance?

753
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:33,710
Well ... Hyungnim Oh Gong wouldn't let me eat her when he wasn't going to either.

754
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:38,590
Aish, I was going to keep her trapped here until Oh Gong lost some strength and go in secretly to eat Sam Jang.

755
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,520
You foolish pig!

756
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,770
Do you think you can still win over the Great Sage?

757
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:48,070
Okay. I will open the door again.

758
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,230
Wait, wait.

759
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,110
Is he trapped in there?

760
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,780
Yes.

761
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,720
If that is burned, he should be trapped in there forever.

762
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,240
I don't have the ability to burn that thing though.

763
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,230
If it's Ma Wang, it could be possible!

764
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,710
Are you going to burn it?

765
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:23,060
Waiting around did bring me a great opportunity such as this.

766
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,010
Why?

767
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,420
Nobody is chasing us.

768
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,540
Huh? Isn't this a tree we saw earlier?

769
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,770
Is it?

770
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,620
I think we can't get out but are just circling around.

771
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,300
- Let's head that way.
- Again?

772
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,710
There's still nothing around. Do you know where the exit is?

773
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,600
We've been locked inside. Pal Gye betrayed me.

774
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,880
Then what do we do?

775
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,050
We'll have to go back to that place from before.

776
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:17,170
I should beat up that demon and make him find a way out.

777
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:21,350
Gosh, that damn Jeo Pal Gye. He blocked the path and made things troublesome.

778
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,180
That rascal of a pig.

779
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,030
Where are you going?

780
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,170
Hey!

781
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,700
Something is strange here.

782
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,610
Yes, something is very strange here.

783
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,410
Where was this place?

784
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,190
What is that smell?

785
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,700
Smell?

786
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,710
The smell of a fire.

787
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:16,400
Someone is burning the picture.

788
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,230
We don't have time. After it's completely burned, we won't be able to get out.

789
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:40,960
Excuse me... I've seen this before.

790
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,970
What?

791
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:46,980
That's right. It's that tree. I've seen that tree before.

792
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,960
When? Where did you see it?

793
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,660
In a general store, I saw a jar with a terrible incident depicted.

794
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:06,780
Did you go to a peddler?

795
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,940
They say what you see there will definitely happen.

796
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,430
I'm really here.

797
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:19,500
So us being here means that whatever is going to happen is happening.

798
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,530
What happens to us here?

799
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,960
Ah... that is...

800
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,380
We don't have time to stay here.

801
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:29,440
We have to do what we have to do so the next event arises.

802
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,560
What did you see? What do we have to do?

803
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,600
What I saw there was a terrible incident.

804
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,130
It might turn into something unfortunate.

805
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,110
I got it. Whatever it is, do it quickly.

806
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,880
Hey, you!

807
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,850
- What is this?
- What's wrong?

808
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,760
What is this?

809
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:10,020
You!

810
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:44,230
What did you do? What is this?!

811
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:49,830
Geumganggo. If you put that on, you can't hurt me.

812
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:53,030
Geumganggo?

813
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,010
Damn it.

814
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:02,120
If she puts the Geumganggo on him properly,

815
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,060
Sam Jang will be able to come out alive.

816
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:11,440
Why? Are you angry?

817
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,210
Even so, you can't hurt me.

818
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:18,180
That's right. I can't hurt you now.

819
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:23,190
Because I will be in pain if you're in danger. Even now.

820
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:32,130
Jin Seon Mi, as long as we're both alive, our contract will always be valid.

822
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,720
♫ I think only about you ♫

823
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,410
I am the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

824
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,650
I've given you back the memory I've taken.

825
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:03,900
You remember my name now, right?

826
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:13,730
Now, you're the only one who can call me out of here.

827
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:17,930
Jin Seon Mi, go.

828
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,230

Hey! You're Sam Jang, right?

832
01:15:55,540 --> 01:16:00,380
You made it back to reality safely. I'm here to pick you up.

833
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,750
Be careful of the grass.

834
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,730
Because the exit door disappeared, you must have had a hard time.

835
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:14,320
I was going back to open the door again. You came out before that.

836
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,140
- You're amazing.
- Is it true that I've come back to reality?

837
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:30,050
Don't you think it's reality when you see me? I'm the top star of the era.

838
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:34,000
If you were still inside the picture, there'd be no PK.

839
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,230
Am I the only one who came out?

840
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:40,370
All the other brides also came out. The people are already out.

841
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,170
Honey!

842
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,870
Honey, are you awake?

843
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,060
Honey, you're finally awake!

844
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,670
Honey!

845
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,810
Honey...

846
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,880
That person... no, what about that rascal?

847
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,280
Ah, the Great Sage?

848
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,870
He... couldn't come out.

849
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,840
Then how will he be able to come out?

850
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,480
He won't be able to come out again.

851
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,270
Because by now, the picture is already completely burned.

852
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:27,960
Goodbye... nut job.

853
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:38,210
So, Ma Wang... no, our chairman sent me here to take you back safely.

854
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:41,340
Sam Jang, now you'll be safe.

855
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:45,900
That rascal couldn't come out... Son Oh Gong.

856
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:49,520
Son Oh? Are you still worried about him right now?

857
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,860
Gosh! You're worrying uselessly.

858
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,770
Hurry, let's go. There will be traffic. Follow me.

859
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:06,190
Congratulations. The horny demon has disappeared and the Great Sage is imprisoned on earth forever.

860
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:10,220
Finally, I've locked Son Oh Gong in a box again.

861
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:13,110
Finally, that rascal!

862
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,270
I got rid of him.

863
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:19,750
In any case, Sam Jang is safe so there won't be any complaints from heaven.

864
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:23,100
Prepare to welcome Sam Jang.

865
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:31,260
Even so, can't you get Son Oh Gong out?

866
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,380
I don't have enough power to get him out of there.

867
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,820
What about friends who can help?

868
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,080
There aren't any.

869
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,830
My younger brother manufactures those cellphones.

870
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,050
[MSUN]

871
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,800
He's the top executive of his company.

872
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,150
Whatever I need, I just need to tell him.

873
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:11,440
Stop over there.

874
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,810
Huh? I have to go directly. Ma Wang is waiting.

875
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:17,130
Stop the car.

876
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,710
Fine, if you call me a crazy bitch, I'll just accept the cursing.

877
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:28,730
Let's try anyway.

878
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,320
Excuse me. Who is the top executive of the company?

879
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,820
The top executive?

880
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:48,190
Could you tell him that someone who knows his hyungnim very well is here?

881
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:50,230
Hyungnim?

882
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:56,460
You really do manufacture cell phones.

883
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,850
I see you are Sam Jang.

884
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:06,000
Yes. I've heard him saying you are like a very close brother.

885
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,360
I only came to tell you that your hyungnim is currently in a very difficult situation.

886
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,400
I felt you should know.

887
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,170
Then, I'll be going.

888
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:22,970
Where is the Geumganggo that my brother brought?

889
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,360
Pardon?

890
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:35,070
I meant that bracelet you gave him.

891
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:37,010
Well, that is...

892
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:41,750
Did you put that on the Great Sage?

893
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,100
I didn't do it on purpose, but in any case he's wearing it now.

894
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:54,040
Do you know that he will suffer heart wrenching pain if he wears that?

895
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,770
Yes.

896
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:00,310
I had no choice but to need it.

897
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,820
Because he was the first one to renege on our contract.

898
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:08,650
Can you please tell me about that contract in detail?

899
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,530
Sam Jang went to meet Sa Oh Jeong?

900
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:18,510
I think she went to find a way to help the Great Sage.

901
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:22,720
Sa Oh Jeong doesn't have the power to pull out that monkey.

902
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,500
It's impossible to come out of there.

903
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,200
She worried about having to get Son Oh Gong out of there.

904
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:36,020
What? Sam Jang said Son Oh Gong's name with her own mouth?

905
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,410
She definitely said Son Oh Gong.

906
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:43,150
Damn it! She remembers his name.

907
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:51,620
Then, does that mean she can call out the rascal?

908
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,400
Aren't I doing something crazy?

909
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,140
You didn't come out of there with your own strength.

910
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:21,100
- The Great Sage used all his strength to save you.
- Why me?

911
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,330
Because he ended up wearing the Geumganggo.

912
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:27,970
Since you're the owner of the Geumganggo, he protected you.

913
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:31,500
Did you really protect me?

914
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,330
Now only you can call me out.

915
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:42,820
If so, to protect me, come back.

916
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:39,930

- I'm in big trouble.

01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,510
What happened?

929
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:55,010
Me loving you.

- Love?
- You scared me!

01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,260
What are you going to do?

932
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:03,020
If that's so, Son Oh Gong who is wearing the Geumganggo is protecting Sam Jang because he's in love?

933
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,280
He never ceases to surprise me.

934
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:07,690
I think some bad things happened that's close to disaster.

935
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,160
- Sam Jang!
- Probably, you'll end up dying by getting shredded to pieces.

936
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,590
- Don't do this! Stop, Son Oh Gong.
- Argh!

937
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:18,460
Oh, no!
