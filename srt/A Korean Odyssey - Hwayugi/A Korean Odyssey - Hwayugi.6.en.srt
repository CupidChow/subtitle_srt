00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,570
What are you going to do now that you've tasted Sam Jang's blood?

6
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,820
The fresh blood, flesh, and bones of Sam Jang are walking in.

7
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,880
It's driving you crazy, right?

8
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,650
I'm someone who has been practicing asceticism for 1,000 years and will one day be a deity.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,030
This tee-ny amount of blood

10
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,840
isn't enough to bring me down.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,800
Agh! What the heck! It's no fun if you're unaffected.

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,530
Ugh, it took a lot for me to prepare for this!

13
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,650
Underhanded punk... How long have you been preparing for this?

"Her pain is your pain."

15
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,720
I made up my mind thanks to the determination you gave me.

16
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,080
Ugh, it hurts. You suffer too.

17
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,880
Suffer the mightiest of pains!

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm definitely going to make you hurt like that.

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,520
But what are you going to do about this? I'm not hurting one bit.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,480
I am extremely pleased to have disappointed you.

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,190
No, no, no. I'm not a careless monkey who gets so easily discouraged.

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,850
Now then, get excited. Starting now, it's an endurance test.

23
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,990
What trick are you pulling out of your sleeve now?

24
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,440
Try being alone with Sam Jang.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,310
What?

26
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,580
Endure it until this has run out. I'll vacate the room for you.

27
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,500
Good luck.

28

Ma Wang.

29
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,500
- Sam Jang.
- The door was open so I just let myself in.

30
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,490
I came because I heard a congratulatory party was being held for you today.

31
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,750
It looks like I'm the first one here.

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,140
I heard you received a big award. Congratulations!

33
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,020
Th-Thank you. Come have a seat.

34
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,720
I see you've lit a lot of candles. They smell nice.

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,170
What fragrance is this?

36
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,800
Lotus flower.

37
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,580
So this is what lotus flower smells like.

38
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,190
I was told because I'm Sam Jang, my blood has a lotus flower scent.

39
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,390
Is this what it smells like then?

40
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,950
Can I help you with something?

41
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,330
D-Don't come near me!

42
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,350
Are you all right?

43

Son Oh Gong!

44
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,920
What did you drag me out of there all of a sudden for?

45
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,640
Ma Wang is feeling a little sick. His pain is my fun.

46
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,810
When he's in pain, I sit back and laugh.

47
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,080
Are you playing some sort of prank right now? In this cold?

48
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,020
- You're cold?
- Of course I'm cold!

49
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,660
Well, the weather is cold. Seeing how it's this chilly when we're indoors.

50
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,350
If you're wearing that coat and are cold, then how do you think I feel?

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,120
I don't want to know. If I know that you're feeling excruciatingly cold,

52
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,590
I love you so much that I'd want to take this coat off and give it to you.

53
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,990
I don't want to take it off.

54
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,820
Don't look at me like that.

55
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,240
Son Oh Gong, I'm cold.

56
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,450
Ah, so cold.

57

For now, let's go to Sureumdong.

58
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,260
Sureumdong? Is that some sort of sauna?

59
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,670

Our Oh Jeong made a lot of paths for me to Sureumdong.

64
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,610
This is the path to Sureumdong.

65
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,130
But this is an advertisement for a college entrance exam?

66
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,600
It's written right here on this sign. Sureumdong.

Oh? It really is. Sureumdong.

Wow, this is Sureumdong?

71
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,570
So it's not a sauna but a bar.

72
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,290
It's not a bar; it's my home.

Didn't you say you couldn't drink?

83
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,440
Having all these collected here is wasted on you so I'll drink them for you.

84
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm going to drink them! As soon as that drinking ban is lifted, I'm going to drink them all.

85
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,990
Ah, the drinking ban.

86
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,260
You said you were being punished, right?

87
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,090
Great Sage, what crime did you commit that you needed to be punished for?

88
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,010
That's heavenly realm business. A mere human doesn't need to know.

89
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,430
I guess it must be a really bad crime.

90
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,150
You said so before, didn't you?

91
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,850
That you were an extremely bad guy, and so you were being locked up.

92
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,480
- What was that place called again?
- The Five Elements Mountain.

93
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,890
Right. The Five Elements Mountain. How long were you locked up in there?

94
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,730
Don't know. I gave up counting after 500 years.

95
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,820
- You were there by yourself for over 500 years?
- Yeah.

96
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,480
Since I was still fine even after being sealed and roasted in the Eight Trigram furnace for 49 days,

97
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,940
they locked me up on the Five Elements Mountain.

98
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,110
It must have been really hard.

99
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,170
Being alone for that long, wasn't it lonely?

100
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,010
That's a really horrific punishment.

101
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,890
Later on, when your drinking ban is lifted, I'll buy you alcohol that's even better than this.

102
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Will there be any reason for me to see you once the drinking ban is lifted?

103
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,820
Human Jin Seon Mi, I doubt you have the right to be forcing your sympathy on me right now.

104
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,760
Think about it. You're the one that's locking me up now.

105
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,270
- You're right.
- Sam Jang, right now, you're another Five Elements Mountain to me.

106
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,130
You must want to free yourself just like back then at the Five Elements Mountain.

107
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,660
Yeah. I'd like it if you disappeared.

108
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,500
Right. For now, I'll disappear from here.

109
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,330
How do I get out of here?

110
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,990
You can get out by going out the same way you came in.

111
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,050
I'll go.

112
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,780
It's cold outside of Sureumdong. Wear that and go.

113
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,770
No need.

114
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,790
I'd rather just disappear.

115
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,900
I can't let you. It's more painful than being roasted in the Eight Trigram Furnace for 49 days

116
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,010
for me to see you cold.

117
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,220
Take this with you too. You said it was good.

118
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,420
No. If you're good to me, I can't feel at ease.

119
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,930
Don't feel at ease. If I have to be tormented, then you should at least be uncomfortable.

120
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,900
My love for you makes me keep you safe,

121
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,260
but I don't want to make you happy.

122
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,660
You're a Five Elements Mountain after all.

123
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,050
All right. I'll uncomfortably take it with me and unhappily drink it.

124
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,230
I'd be thankful for that.

125
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,500
Sam Jang disappeared?

126
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,730
Yes. She left her coat and purse here and just disappeared.

127
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,350
And you said Ma Wang and Oh Gong weren't here either.

128
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,560
I think they were drinking together,

129
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
but when I got here they were both gone.

130
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,030
This sensitive pig nose is getting a whiff of something suspicious.

131
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,390
It feels like something definitely happened.

132
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,630
A real trouble has come up.

133
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,470
Right? You think something happened too, don't you, Sa Oh Jeong?

134
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,110
This is a cup that Hyungnim uses often,

135
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,360
but it's got a stain.

136
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,250
What could this stain be from?

137
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,890
Coffee? Black tea?

138
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,710
How am I supposed to know that? Just throw it away!

139
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll have to try cleaning it with baking soda.

140
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,690
Honestly, when he's got enough money to start a ceramics factory and still have money leftover,

141
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,670
what's he got to be so dirty for?

142
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Ma Wang's ring is empty.

143
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,430
Ma Wang, the thing you put in here is Sam Jang's blood, right? Can't you give this ring to me?

144
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,310
Do not covet

145
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,350
that which isn't yours.

146
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,860
Where oh where could the blood that was in this have gone?

147
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,740
Looks like some real fun has started.

148
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,090
Ma Wang, have you recovered your strength?

149
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,420
Should I get you more energy beads?

150
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,620
I'm fine.

151
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,850
My voice!

152
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,580
Ma Wang, your voice is...

153
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,060
Se-se-se...

154
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,620
I—

155
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm fine.

156
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,680
Hurry up and get me some medicine that will—

157
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,180
That will—

158
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,410
That will wipe out the blood's potency.

159
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,240
Yes, sir.

160
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,970
I'm fine. I'm unaffected.

161
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,180
Completely un—

162
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,080
unaffected.

163
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,160
- What brings you here without notice?
- There's something I urgently need.

164
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,960
Grandmother's not here though.

165
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,400
That's a problem.

166
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,420
When is she coming back?

167
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,750
Don't know. She said she'd be gone a long while this time.

168
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,630
This is important, so answer properly.

169
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,490
If you're going to act like this then I might just close up shop and run away from home.

170
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,920
Then you won't be able to get anything.

171
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Please? Get the item for me.

172
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,550
Okay. But in return, pay in cash.

173
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,590
No receipt so Grandmother doesn't know.

174
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,260
Come on in.

175
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,050
Is Ma Wang sick?

176
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,650
A demon that consumed Sam Jang's blood

177
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,190
would have quite a huge craving for her.

178
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,660
It must have been extremely painful for Ma Wang to try to resist that.

179
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,270
Yeah.

180
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,710
He was going on about mental perseverance for 1,000 years but couldn't even handle this little amount of time.

181
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,720
I believed in his abilities and so prepared a big hourglass, you know.

182
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,240
He almost got our Sam Jang.

183
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,840
If you hadn't gone in,

184
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,310
then Sam Jang would already be gone by Ma Wang's hands.

185
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,630
She probably would.

186
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,510
It's a pity but because of this thing, I've got no choice but to protect her for now.

187
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,020
Great Sage, shall I buy you some time?

188
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,700
Although I don't have the ability to stop it for as long as you can,

189
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,460
it's possible for me to hold back this much time.

190
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,780
If I keep a hold on just this much time,

191
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,270
then you'll be able to use Ma Wang to get rid of Sam Jang.

192
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,320
It's a chance to free yourself from Sam Jang's control.

193
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,700
I can get rid of her?

194
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,590
For now, get a strawberry ice cream ready for take out before the hourglass runs out.

195
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,100
Yes, sir.

196
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,170
Will you be able to do the broadcast taping today?

197
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,460
Should I cancel your scheduled activities?

198
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,990
Because the medicine you g-g-got me...

199
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,220
calmed me down a bit.

200
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,240
It's a relief.

201
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,670
But it looks like you're still suffering from side effects.

202
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,170
I think I have to take someth—

203
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,360
something that's m-more eff-effective.

204
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,390
You've already lost a lot of your vigor from taking the medicine.

205
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,280
Taking something stronger would be irrational.

206
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,220
I'm fine.

207
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,100
Rather than this embarrass-ssment from not being able to su-suppress my craving

208
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,160
and drooooling like this,

209
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,530
taking medicine and losing some energy is...

210
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,930
Seeing as you've already become like this, what do you think about just eating Sam Jang?

211
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,070
Don't talk about Sam Jang!

212
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,470
Just what is Sam Jang? Why do you have to suffer because of Sam Jang?

213
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,120
I'll capture Sam Jang. Please eat Sam Jang.

214
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,450
I told you not to talk about Sam Jang.

215
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,350
Even just hearing the sound of Sam Jang makes me shake more!

216
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,170
- Darn it!
- I apologize.

217
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,510
I got slightly fooled while being careless,

218
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,450
but I won't b-b-break down anymore!

219
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,970
That's fine.

220
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,370
All my scheduled events

221
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,080
will proceed as p-p-planned.

222
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,450
Understood.

223
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,350
So tired...

224
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,230
CEO, do you want to go see the flower shop that's up for sale in Paju?

225
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,010
Sorry, I have to go to the broadcasting station for a bit.

226
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,200
The broadcasting station?

227
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,740
You're finally making your television debut?

228
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,310
What's it for? Shopping channel? Variety program? What?

229
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,670
It's not for that kind of thing. I just need to see PK real quick.

230
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,920
"See PK real quick?" You've become that kind of person?

231
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,490
Wow, this is just...

232
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,910
"I'm going to play a round of baseball with (Jang) Dong Geun and have a beer with (Jo) In Sung."

233
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,570
"I'm going shopping with Tae Yang." It's just like that kind of thing!

234
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,160
CEO, you're really awesome.

235
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,090
If you knew the truth, I wouldn't be as great as you think I am.

236
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,190
But then again, I hear that these days

237
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,000
celebrities have their own share of life issues.

238
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,570
That could be possible.

239
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,460
CEO, next time, can you ask PK to take a picture with my daughter?

240
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,510
Sure. I'll talk to him about it.

241
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,500
Salute! Salute! Oh, wait a minute.

242
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,050
I mean, what kind of celebrity drives themselves?

243
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,000
Call that bodyguard or Secretary Son guy over.

244
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,710
I don't want to bother him. He already feels burdened.

245
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,670
I'll be back.

246
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,680
This is why you have to pick people well.

247
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,990
There's no other person like me.

248
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,550
They only cared about looks and picked a total swallow
(homonym for gold-digger)

249
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,840
and can't even use him properly. Ouch!

250
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,020
Who was that?

251
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,970
That cocky realtor. No wonder my ears were itching.

252
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,330
How dare he call me a swallow? I'm a monkey.

253
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,820
Now.

254
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm glad the medicine I found was effective.

255
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,360
I got a lot of my energy back through the energy from the audience.

256
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,710
As expected, the energy from the live broadcasts is the best.

257
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,580
Excuse me! Chairman Woo Hwi, could you give us your autograph?

258
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,860
Oh, sure. Of course.

259
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,550
- Your name?
- Hye Soo.

260
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,760
Hye Soo. What a pretty name.

261
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,720
Heart. There.
[You're my destiny, Chairman Woo Hwi]

262
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,550
"You're my destiny?" Why, thank you.

263
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,380
Can you take a picture of us all?

264
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,620
Of course. I was waiting for that. Come on over here.

265
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,240
Now then...

266
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,840
Yes, Jeo Pal Gye. I'm at the broadcasting station.

267
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,870
Where should I go?

268
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,170
The second floor? Okay.

269
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,370
- It came out well.
- Take one with mine too, please.

270
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,950
Of course. Come here. Now then,

271
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,870
One, two, thr—

272
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,170
Ah, I apologize. I'm sorry.

273
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,300
Come here. Now, one, two, three.

274
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,390
Thank you!

275
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,160
Are you all right?

276
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,250
You're doing badly again?

277
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,330
That photo just now caught my eyes changing. Follow them and delete it.

278
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,150
Understood.

279
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,160
Why is this acting up like this?

280
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,280
What's wrong with these? Calm down!

281
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,840
It's not even like Sam Jang is next to me. Right?

282
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,890
No, why is Sam Jang here?

283
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,710
Ma Wang!

284
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Chairman! Chairman!

285
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,690
You did amazing at today's filming!

286
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,470
You know that our viewership went up again?

287
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:28,740
- Our viewership is all thanks to you, Chairman!
- Thank you! Thank—

288
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,320
Oh, is the Chairman sick?

289
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,670
- Oh, why is he like that?
- Does he have hand tremors?

290
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,400
Maybe he worked too hard for the shoot?

291
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,950
Here. There you go.

292
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,990
The things you left behind at Ma Wang's house.

293
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,240
Thank you for bringing them to me.

294
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,910
Oh, is Ma Wang at the studio today, too?

295
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,250
I'm not sure.

296
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,970
Sam Jang, be careful.

297
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,490
Pardon?

298
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,430
Oh, never mind.

299
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,060
Just saying not to leave your things behind like that.

300
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,640
Bye.

301
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,580
Are you looking for Ma Wang?

302
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,230
- Where is he?
- Ma Wang ended up wanting to eat up Sam Jang, right?

303
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,970
Pig, if you open your mouth, I'll bite you to shreds.

304
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,790
Calm down. Calm down.

305
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:40,270
I'm also for Ma Wang eating up Sam Jang.

306
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,630
If there's anything I can help with, I will.

307
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,030
But in return, I'm reserving a bite for me.

308
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,110
- Let's see.
- Hey, don't touch.

309
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,200
It must be hard for you to endure.

310
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Who do you think caused all this?

311
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,410
How dare you try to comfort me just because you have a mouth? Keep it to yourself.

312
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,740
Fine. Then I'll keep the comforting words inside.

313
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,440
- Should I apologize instead?
- No. Just chew and swallow it.

314
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,360
I don't even want to hear your voice.

315
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,110
Fine. At times like these, being near you and saying all this probably sounds like I'm just trying to make fun.

316
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,150
Because of that Geumganggo, I was also having a hard time.

317
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,750
"Her pain is your pain." "Love."

318
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,510
♫ "Because I love you."

319
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,820
When you did those things, I was so upset.

320
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,770
I couldn't keep myself from doing this to you. You understand my situation, right?

321
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah, I understand it very well.

322
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,410
I will also make sure to get my revenge for this, okay?

323
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,770
I hope you do.

324
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:01,560
You tell me you had the patience of a thousand years, yet you couldn't endure this long.

325
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,870
If I don't endure, the person you love will disappear.

326
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,600
You will die from torment.

327
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,750
Ma Wang, that's not it.

328
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,280
If Sam Jang dies and disappears, so will the Geumganggo.

329
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,510
So whether she dies then or not, I won't be tormented.

330
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,770
Whatever the case, right now, because of this Guemganggo,

331
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,470
you can't let Sam Jang die.

332
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,960
Aigoo, he hit hard on purpose... With one hand seriously....

333
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,090
If I keep a hold on just this much time,

334
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,710
then you'll be able to use Ma Wang to get rid of Sam Jang.

335
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,520
It's a chance to free yourself from Sam Jang's control.

336
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,570
- Why do you keep shaking?
- It's the side effect of the medicine for deadening the blood's energy.

337
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,230
Oh, give it to me. I'll pour it for you.

338
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,390
Seriously. Side effects...

339
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,390
Thank you.

340
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,970
Aigoo. It's because of the side effects.

341
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh, so refreshing.

342
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,630
If I find the car, will I figure out who I am?

343
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,600
Hey, what are you doing?

344
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,450
Oh? You're that trainee from before.

345
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,210
I nearly died from having nightmares because of you.

346
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,700
So unlucky.

347
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,260
I don't want to see you, so go away.

348
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,780
Huh? What's this?

349
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,040
- Hey, did you just scratch my car?
- It wasn't me.

350
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,810
I didn't even touch it.

351
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,980
Where are you going?!

352
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,350
I've caught you red-handed.

353
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,740
The thing you just dropped, you used it to scratch my car, right?

354
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
What is this?

355
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,300
Give it to me. It's my eye.

356
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,100
That... goes in... there.

357
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,410
Alice!

358
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,550
When did she get that drunk?

359
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,620
Anyway, thank you for taking care of her.

360
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,430
You're pretty.

361
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,650
Are you hoping to be a celebrity by chance?

362
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,180
Maybe.

363
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,530
You know the audition programs that are popular these days, right?

364
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,680
I'm the casting manager for them.

365
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,980
If you're interested in auditioning, give me a call.

366
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,450
It's a chance for you to get famous.

367
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,470
Is this the flower shop that's up for sale?

368
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,700
Yes. She wants to sell fast and just wants what the land is worth.

369
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,010
The owner has gone half insane after her boyfriend died.

370
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,420
Aigoo, this is worth a good amount.

371
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,780
If you give me a little time, I could get you the full price.

372
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,920
Please take care of it as soon as possible.

373
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,200
I saw her during the consultation, but she was withering away like a dying flower.

374
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,540
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

375
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,930
Hello.

376
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,150
You seem very different.

377
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,310
I feel different, too.

378
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,160
I don't want to sell the shop anymore. Sorry.

379
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,860
Pardon?

380
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,920
You said you wanted to sell straight away.

381
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,200
While crying, you said you had too many memories here and you couldn't stay any longer. If you do this now—

382
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,790
I felt like that then, but I don't have any feelings like that anymore.

383
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,520
I see that you cut your hair, too.

384
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,730
Yes. I'm sorry about this.

385
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,330
Pick any plant. I'll give it to you.

386
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,960
Oh my gosh.

387
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,940
Amazing.

388
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,450
They say that when women cut their hair, it sorts out their feelings, too.

389
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,540
It must really be true. Wow, it's amazing.

390
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,340
It looks like something cut it off.

391
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,490
I wonder who cut it.

392
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,360
She probably cut it at the hair salon.

393
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,160
Do you like that style?

394
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,800
You want me to ask her which salon cut it?

395
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,820
I think I know.

396
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,190
Was it you? Did you cut it?

397
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,890
Right. It's possible to have a conversation with a tree.

398
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,790
It doesn't matter.

399
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,430
I won't ask and won't be curious.

400
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:45,510
I'll just go pick out the most expensive plant.

401
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,190
There's an evil spirit left on the hair.

402
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,770
Did you cut your girlfriend's hair?

403
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,790
Then was that woman affected by an evil spirit?

404
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,280
It cut her hair here?

405
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,040
Maybe it's not a dangerous demon?

406
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,510
Miss.

407
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,720
Please buy one.

408
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,110
I don't have a boyfriend to use this with.

409
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,290
Please buy it from me.

410
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:05,300
Grandma, have you heard of someone at this park getting her hair cut?

411
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,480
Give me one.

412
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,570
5,000 won.

413
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,760
Hyungnim.

414
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,660
Oh. Sit down.

415
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,600
I'll help you all I can to get rid of Sam Jang.

416
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,210
I'd be thankful.

417
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,620
But you don't need to close your business because of me.

418
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,840
Finish your business for the rest of the day, and then let's think about it slowly.

419
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,310
It's okay. Once Ma Wang is done with the detoxification, we will no longer have a chance.

420
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,090
That's true. We'll have to hurry.

421
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,240
If we make a plan and decide on the path, we can get rid of Sam Jang tonight.

422
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,840
Right away tonight?

423
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,940
A cold wave is coming tonight.

424
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,510
The chance for success will be higher if I use the power of the Winter General properly.

425
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:23,960
I'll hold onto you so that you can't run to her until Ma Wang eats up Sam Jang.

426
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,020
Tonight.

427
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,370
We don't have much time left.

428
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,040
Oh! Today! Today's Oh Jeong's yakbap (flavored rice) day!

429
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,210
Oh Jeong said he would make some yakbab and wait tonight.

430
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,530
Since it's a dish that takes a lot of effort to make,

431
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,650
he'll be really disappointed if I don't eat it while it's warm.

432
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,380
Yakbap is good even if you eat it after it cools down.

433
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,890
Really? I see.

434
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,500
I also have to watch My Golden Life. Do you not watch it?

435
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,400
There's a repeat airing tomorrow morning.

436
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,340
Watch it freely in a world without Sam Jang.

437
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,310
I have to watch it live, though.

438
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,360
Son Oh Gong!

439
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,610
Oh! Sam Jang is calling me.

440
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,540
Ah, seriously. It's all ruined. I don't think tonight's possible.

441
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,600
Why don't you go and finish your business for the rest of the day, too?

442
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,060
You have to earn to live well.

443
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,480
I'll be going.

444
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,180
Hyungnim!

445
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,640
Tonight with the cold wave would be perfect.

446
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,840
Why did you call me from somewhere so cold instead of somewhere warm?

447
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,740
In this park, there were a few people who had their hair shorn.

448
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,280
But I can't tell whether it's the work of an evil spirit or not, so I called you.

449
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,150
Sorry for calling you to somewhere cold.

450
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,530
Not me but you. You're cold. Your cheeks are red.

451
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,310
There's a cold wave coming tonight.

452
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,180
I know.

453
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,490
The cold wave is coming. I don't want to send her off on a chilly night.

454
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,240
- What is it?
- You wore something even prettier today.

455
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,160
This? I've worn this often.

456
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,010
Do you want me to buy you some clothes? You like green.

457
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,350
I think I should get you a green coat on the way home.

458
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,540
How about something to eat? Should we go to a family restaurant? Like a family?

459
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,780
Did something happen?

460
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,210
You're being so different from what you said yesterday.

461
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,290
- What did I say?
- You said you wanted me to disappear.

462
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,020
I just want to treat you well, that's all.

463
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,820
You're not complaining that you have to be nice because of the Geumganggo.

464
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,230
You must mean it.

465
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,210
What are you talking about? I've been consistently nice to you.

466
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:45,990
It's the first time you said you'd be nice and mean it.

467
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:51,790
Oh no, there was once before when you were being sincerely nice.

468
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,490
When you were trying to convince me to give up this lifetime, you were nice to me.

469
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,300
You were being nice saying you wished me to never have any regrets when I died.

470
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,590
Oh, there's a lot of people lined up.

471
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,310
It must be something tasty. Let's go.

472
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,460
Come on, let's go see.

473
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,540
What is that? It's a ball of cotton.

474
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,090
Why would they line up for this?

475
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,680
You don't know cotton candy?

476
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,550
You like ice-cream. This is really sweet, too.

477
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,250
Sweet? You want to have some?

478
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,090
Okay.

479
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,170
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

480
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,490
- Come here. Come here.
- What's he doing?

481
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,160
What are you doing? You have to stand in line.

482
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,500
You want to stand in line? Okay.

483
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,470
I'm sorry.

484
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,130
♫ To me, you become love ♫

485
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:58,220
♫ To me, you become my world ♫

486
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,750
Isn't it amazing?

487
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:06,940
♫ Now you let me breathe ♫

488
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,640
♫ To me, you become love ♫

489
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,820
No, bigger. This big!

490
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,820
More, more!

491
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,500
Wow. This is the first time I've seen one as big as this.

492
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,380
If it's any bigger, I could cover myself with it when I sleep.

493
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,380
You want to cover yourself with it when you sleep? Okay.

494
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,560
Oh, it's okay. This is enough.

495
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,730
I could make you one as big as a cloud.

496
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm scared that you'll really do what you say.

497
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,130
Here. Try some.

498
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,430
♫ In the end, I stay by your side ♫

499
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,950
♫ To me, you become love ♫

500
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,300
Oh! This cotton is really sweet.

501
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,980
- It's sweet, right?
- Yeah. Give it to me.

502
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,300
You said it's for me.

503
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,760
Yours is ... this much.

504
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,010
♫ I will always be by your side ♫

505
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,590
- Wow.
- You've lived that long, yet you've never had cotton candy?

506
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,190
If you didn't wear the Geumganggo, you would have never found out about cotton candy.

507
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,560
Yes, yes. Thanks to you, I found out.

508
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,860
I like this cotton ball. It's good.

509
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,790
It's the first time you've said you liked something because of me.

510
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:30,160
You always said it's painful seeing me while wearing the Geumganggo.

511
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:34,310
You said I'm the Five Elements Mountain that's crushing you.

512
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:39,000
So... you said you wanted me to disappear.

513
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:46,920
That's right. I think it would be good if you disappeared.

514
00:45:54,830 --> 00:46:01,970
When the Geumganggo disappears and all your feelings toward me disappear,

515
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:05,330
will this cotton candy disappear, too?

516
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,210
The memory of having said you liked that it's so sweet...

517
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,250
all of that will be erased away, right?

518
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,370
Are you stupid? This will still exist.

519
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:23,080
Even without the Geumganggo, what's sweet is sweet, and what you like is what you like.

520
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,430
♫ Can we go back ♫

521
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:36,110
Oh. My hands are sticky. Let me go wash it off.

522
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,680
♫ Always behind of you ♫

523
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,590
Why, out of all times, do I have to be happy right now?

524
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,550
Ah, seriously. Damn, this cotton ball is so sweet!

525
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,610
♫ Close your eyes ♫

526
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,100
♫ Just seeing the back of my head leaving ♫

527
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,140
♫ When I leave you ♫

528
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,820
♫ Are you with me ♫

529
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:16,600
♫ Even if the world hates us ♫

530
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,670
♫ I will ♫

531
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,800
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

532
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,570
Are you stupid?

533
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:31,270
Even without the Geumganggo, what's sweet is sweet, and what you like is what you like.

534
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,760
♫ Always behind of you ♫

535
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,340
♫ Always behind of you ♫

536
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm sorry. I took a picture of you putting the lock on.

537
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,440
But it doesn't show your face.

538
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,000
If you're offended, I'll delete it.

539
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,950
Are you a foreigner?

540
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,170
I came from the States.

541
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,580
But you speak Korean well.

542
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,650
Since my face doesn't show, it's okay.

543
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,940
Wow, it looks good.

544
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,720
Thanks.

545
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:42,610
Hyungnim, enjoy it.

546
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,630
Hey, what's wrong with our Oh Jeong?

547
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,420
I don't know.

548
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,550
Ma Wang isn't coming home today either I guess.

549
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,760
It means detoxification is still not finished.

550
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,410
Hey! Why are you always here? Aren't you going home?

551
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,380
Ah, I'm here helping out Bu Ja.

552
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,190
Oh, Bu Ja is practicing to go on the audition program.

553
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,080
Audition? Wow, it's amazing enough that a zombie watched TV, but you're going to appear on it?

554
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,580
If I appear on the show, my family and friends might recognize me and try to call.

555
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,650
That's right. The enemy who killed you could recognize you and come find you.

556
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,210
Rather than an enemy,

557
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,120
I want to see my family.

558
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,250
Listen carefully. What are you going to do if you see your family when you're already a corpse?

559
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:46,590
Just find the enemy and get your revenge, then get buried.

560
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:48,760
That's the cleanest way to handle it.

561
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,870
Ah, seriously...

562
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,410
But then again,

563
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,230
I'm already dead.

564
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:11,160
Don't worry. Even if you find your family, you won't have to be buried.

565
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,470
I'll find a ton of energy beads for you. I'm a top star.

566
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:22,180
Also... I think I'll become very strong.

567
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:28,800
At that time, I'll kick the butt of that horrible monkey.

568
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,630
Jeo Pal Gye, thank you.

569
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,570
Don't cry, okay?

570
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,520
You want me to turn on the air conditioner?

571
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,740
Sa Oh Jeong, where's the remote for the air conditioner?

572
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,550
Sa Oh Jeong?

573
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,200
Sa Oh Jeong! Sa Oh—

574
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,960
What? You were here. Why didn't you answer when I called? What are you doing?

575
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,510
What's the matter? Oh, did your stocks go down?

576
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,450
The stain won't come off.

577
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,180
Ah, just throw it out!

578
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,500
Ma Wang, it's a relief your hands aren't shaking anymore.

579
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,040
The shaking has stopped, but there are still some slight side effects left.

580
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,550
Ma Wang.

581
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:36,210
Until the side effects go away, I'll have to cancel all my appointments.

582
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,330
I will take care of them.

583
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,000
Did you find a strong detox medicine that will

584
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,340
purify the blood of Sam Jang?

585
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,710
I asked the grandson of the peddler to find me something.

586
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,960
Hurry up and find it.

587
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,780
It's totally embarrassing.

588
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:15,790
The medicine this time is dangerous. Be careful or he could die.

589
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,760
I can't have him take anything dangerous.

590
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:39,230
If a demon eats Sam Jang, how strong will he become?

591
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:45,410
For example, if I were to take a bite of Sam Jang right now, would I be able to win against even the Great Sage?

592
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,700
Why are you asking about that?

593
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,610
You said you were going to go out with Sam Jang. Did you lose the nerve to do it?

594
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:55,130
Come on, now. When did I say I was going to go out with Sam Jang?

595
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,830
I've have no desire for that whatsoever!

596
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:01,110
No matter what happens to Sam Jang, it doesn't matter one bit to me.

597
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,800
Don't mess with Sam Jang.

598
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,160
If something happens to Sam Jang right now, it'll cause trouble for many of us.

599
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,750
Sure, sure.

600
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,260
To start off, I won't be able to get promoted,

601
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,570
and Ma Wang won't be able to become a deity.

602
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,240
And the Great Sage would never be able to return to the heavenly realm.

603
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,860
And Bu Ja would disappear as well.

604
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,650
What does Bu Ja have to do with Sam Jang?

605
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,500
Bu Ja is a body woken from the dead by the power of Sam Jang's blood. A possessed corpse.

606
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,880
If Sam Jang is gone, then of course Bu Ja would return to a corpse.

607
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,730
We can just keep feeding her energy beads.

608
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,290
Have you seen a dead body survive on the strength of that alone?

609
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,690
She'll rot away in a day.

610
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,580
So if Sam Jang dies,

611
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,600
Bu Ja also dies.

612
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:09,140
Look. The rash that was here

613
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,210
has moved down to here.

614
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,430
Want to see it?

615
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,050
No.

616
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,720
Well, anyway, it's not visible when I'm wearing clothes so that's a relief.

617
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:30,100
I'll put all of my being into making sure you never have to experience such side effects again.

618
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,470
What is she being so serious for?

619
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,950
How close are you?

620
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,600
I'm just about there. Should I go straight to the chairman's office?

621
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,180
No need. I'll come to meet you in the basement parking lot.

622
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,750
Did you call Sam Jang here?

623
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,290
Yes.

624
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,330
For what purpose?

625
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm going to stab her.

626
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,090
Once the scent of her blood spreads, Ma Wang won't be able to resist it anymore.

627
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,860
- The Great Sage is likely to interfere though.
- I'll block him.

628
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,350
You should know well that you're no match for the Great Sage.

629
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,680
Even if I die by his hands, it can still buy some time.

630
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,670
Whether that's 5 seconds or 10 seconds, that's plenty of time for Ma Wang.

631
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,710
Ma Wang.

632
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,620
- Ma Wang!
- Ah, that startled me.

633
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,000
What?

634
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,300
- T-The thing is...
- What is it?

635
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,230
Secretary Ma, what is the matter?

636
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,620
Sam Jang, I really do apologize for this.

637
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,220
Ma Wang, that must hurt.

638
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,720
Yeah. It hurts.

639
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:11,280
Hey, you dog secretary. If you do something like this again, I'll kill you.

640
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,790
She's not going to die by your hands.

641
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,460
At the very least, she needs to die by my hands.

642
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,300
I apologize.

643
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,210
Um, excuse me, demons?

644
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:33,620
I'm the only human here so I might not be understanding this situation right,

645
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,590
but was Secretary Ma just trying to stab me?

646
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,590
- Yes.
- Why?

647
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,350
Because Ma Wang wants you.

648
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:49,190
He does? Why?

649
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:55,900
Because I drank some of your blood.

650
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,210
How?

651
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,250
I gave it to him.

652
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,460
Why did you do that?

653
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:17,000
Because you wished to get rid of me?

654
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,320
Yeah.

655
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,870
Ma Wang, are you in a lot of pain?

656
00:58:53,490 --> 00:59:01,500
It's bearable. Besides, that punk looked like he's in more pain than I am.

657
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,820
He's the one that made this entire mess.

658
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,660
Serves him damn right.

659
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,040
Ma Wang, I'm truly sorry.

660
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,180
As you spoke of earlier, please kill me now.

661
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,570
That's right. I'm going to kill you.

662
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,880
But not now.

663
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,820
When I feel the time has come that I need to kill you,

664
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,500
I'll pick a date and do it.

665
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,620
Until that happens you're not allowed to be killed by anyone else.

666
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,470
That's an order.

667
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,520
Ma Wang.

668
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:44,190
Don't ever try to kill without my permission again.

669
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,350
Yes, sir.

670
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,530
You're another Five Elements Mountain to me.

671
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,090
I'd like it if you disappeared.

672
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,240
♫ When I love you ♫

673
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,420
♫ Did you miss me? ♫

674
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,780
♫ Even if my feeling change ♫

675
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,160
♫ I will ♫

676
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,920
What's sweet is sweet, and what you like is what you like.

677
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:29,090
Liar. That jerk.

678
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,820
♫ When I saw you ♫

679
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,960
♫ Always behind of you ♫

680
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,060
How could I let myself be fooled by a liar and do something so stupid?

681
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:15,100
Where was it? It was somewhere around here.

682
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:33,340
So it was you? The evil spirit cutting people's hair.

683
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,280
I love the hair that contains the sadness of love.

684
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,970
If I cut your hair, you won't hurt one bit anymore.

685
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:49,500
There won't be one ounce of your feelings for him left. Give it to me.

686
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,960
My feelings for him will completely go away?

687
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,920
If this isn't love, then what is?

688
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,010
I'll protect you.

689
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:16,480
I said I'd do everything you want for you.

690
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,260
I like this cotton ball. It's good.

691
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,190
I don't want them to go away.

692
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,620
Son Oh Gong.

693
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,220
Go to a hairdresser's to get your hair cut.

694
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,390
Although you'll be pretty to me no matter how it's cut.

695
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:46,820
Because I love you.

696
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,170
I don't care how it looks to you.

697
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:54,270
All you need to do is make sure that I, as Sam Jang, am protected from disappearing.

698
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,720
As you command, I'll protect you.

699
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,590
I got the stain out!

700
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:36,200
Like I thought, it was a good idea to ask on that housewives site!

701
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,810
I should leave a review.

702
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,200
Hey, Secretary Ma! How's Ma Wang doing?

703
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,690
Go away, you tattletale pig.

704
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,820
Aigoo, why do you have to be like that?

705
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,460
If I hadn't snitched to Ma Wang, you'd be dead by the Great Sage's hand by now.

706
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,450
Jeo Pal Gye, why did you do that?

707
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:05,480
You were drooling while asking me to give you one bite, yet why did you change your mind?

708
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,940
It was just to get one bite, so it wasn't worth the risk.

709
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,690
You should have been a little more generous when enticing a pig, no?

710
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,440
Oh, Bu Ja! You're done?

711
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,040
I practiced hard again today.

712
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,390
Good job. Let's go. I'll take you home.

713
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:47,700
Your cooking today is especially good.

714
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,200
I put in some extra effort.

715
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,460
You seem like you're in a good mood today.

716
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,240
Yes. I figured out how to get rid of a stain that was bothering me.

717
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,720
You didn't throw it away and cleaned it instead?

718
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,000
Wow. You're amazing.

719
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,050
I called Unni over since you cooked so much,

720
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,290
but she says she's not coming.

721
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:18,270
I wonder why Sam Jang... said she wouldn't come?

722
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:24,110
I guess she didn't want to eat with a traitor at the same table.

723
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:28,930
How could she eat at the same table with a predator?

724
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,330
Did the two of you do something bad to Unni?

725
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:47,860
The stain is harder to wash off the longer you wait.

726
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,510
The two of you, please resolve it quickly.

727
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:59,320
What?

728
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,020
What?

729
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,720
I took a very strong detox medicine.

730
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,470
I won't be dangerous anymore,

731
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,650
so you don't need to avoid me.

732
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,890
But when you change your mind, you can hurt me at any time.

733
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:28,250
There is someone I have to save, and I need you in order to save that person.

734
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,350
You are still very useful to me,

735
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,910
so I will never hurt you. Trust me.

736
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,190
Secretary Ma.

737
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:42,500
Sam Jang, I'm sorry.

738
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,770
Since Ma Wang tells me not to, I won't do it anymore.

739
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:53,640
She's apologizing, but I don't feel that she's sorry.

740
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:02,080
Well, I guess I can't expect feelings from an evil spirit.

741
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,040
I'll let this pass with the belief that should this happen again, you'll get stabbed in my place.

742
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:59,070
CEO, have some ice cream.

743
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,680
He bought it for me?

744
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:08,140
No one came. I got this for you.

745
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,240
I see, you waited for Secretary Son.

746
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,080
I didn't wait for him. Why would I?

747
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,060
Ah, you fought with your boyfriend, so he doesn't even buy you ice cream.

748
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,740
He, he's not my boyfriend.

749
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:25,680
Right. It's very disappointing when you're used to him always buying it for you and then he suddenly doesn't.

750
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,820
I guess you don't even want to see this ice cream.

751
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,420
What is he to me that I wouldn't like ice cream?

752
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,570
It has nothing to do with it.

753
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:35,890
- Then have some.
- Never mind.

754
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:47,420
Oh... that idiot must be playing with the CEO's heart...

755
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:51,950
After buying her a mere strawberry ice cream, he hasn't done crap for her.

756
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,490
I'll eat it.

757
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,810
Why did the chair...

758
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:05,040
Theory of parallels?

759
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:11,000
Crap? I've done so much for her!

760
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:17,240
Hyungnim, it'll be too late now that Ma Wang has completely detoxified.

761
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,830
Today was the best time. It's too bad.

762
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:24,950
Ma Wang is done detoxifying, but Sam Jang really hates me now.

763
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,860
Comfort her.

764
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:30,580
I did. I told her she's pretty and that I love her, but she hates me even more.

765
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,130
It's because you're not being sincere.

766
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,690
How can there be sincerity to an evil spirit who's wearing the Geumganggo?

767
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:40,630
But Sam Jang has sincerity since she's human.

768
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:47,850
Look into her heart and see why she hates you more.

769
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,110
That way, you can make her feel better.

770
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:00,430
First, thank you very much.
[Wooja]

771
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:04,180
Thank you for working with Dragon Studios.

772
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:09,710
No, no. The fact that we're able to work with the big global movie director Bong Sang Woo

773
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,880
is an honor for us.

774
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,100
Thank you. The movie Wooja that you will be working with Director Bong Sang Woo is, as you know,

775
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,460
it's gonna be fantastic.

776
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:26,060
It's a fantasy about a friendship between a big white bull and a little girl.

777
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,600
White bull. A white bull.

778
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,480
I liked that part very much, and it's the reason I wanted to get involved in the production.

779
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,650
I heard the main character is a Korean girl.

780
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,030
What kind of actress do you want?

781
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:43,120
There's an image of a little girl I suggested to Director Bong.

782
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:49,050
To be honest, when I was young, the mysterious girl I met in Korea

783
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,940
became the motif for this movie.

784
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:55,930
Ah, you have a clear image of her.

785
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:01,830
Yeah. She was extraordinary.

786
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:09,050
It's such a vivid memory that I can draw her image at any given moment.

787
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:20,930
When I was young, I saw her at Lotus Village in Gangwondo.

788
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:23,880
She's the girl I met at that time.

789
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,950
She always carried a yellow umbrella.

790
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:33,960
An umbrella?

791
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,020
You must be punished!

792
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,550
Will you trade umbrellas with me?

793
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,080
Why have you remembered this girl for so long?

794
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,310
She was my first love.

795
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,000
First love?

796
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,830
First love.

797
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,650
Son Oh Gong just came by.

798
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,960
I didn't come to find him.

799
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,620
I just came to have some ice cream I like.

800
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:47,340
It's an hourglass. Does the ice cream come out within this time?

801
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,970
I'm slow, so I can't make that happen in that time.

802
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,620
I heard you dislike Son Oh Gong very much.

803
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,260
I have no reason to dislike him.

804
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,320
His feeling isn't even genuine.

805
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,070
Sam Jang, would you like me to buy you some time?

806
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:14,030
I don't have the ability to make ice cream quickly,

807
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:19,590
but I can hold onto the Geumganggo for this much time.

808
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:24,440
Today, the strongest cold wave is coming, so my power is at its peak.

809
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:30,130
I think I can freeze the power of Gumganggo for at least this much time.

810
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,400
It's a chance to find out his true feelings,

811
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,990
so if you get that short moment, what would you like to know?

812
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,380
♫ When I saw you ♫

813
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,930
♫ I think only about you ♫

814
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:24,290
♫ When I love you ♫

815
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:27,520
The more I look into a human's heart, the harder it gets.

816
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,690
♫ Did you miss me ♫

817
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:34,950
♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

818
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,380
♫ I will ♫

819
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:44,830
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

820
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:48,980
♫ Can we go back ♫

821
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,200
♫ When I saw you ♫

822
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:03,040
♫ Always behind of you ♫

823
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,180
♫ Always behind of you ♫

824
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,350
It's a very short amount of time while it's snowing.

825
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:24,390
What do you want to know about his true feelings?

826
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,990
Son Oh Gong, what I want to know is...

827
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:39,440
am I pretty right now?

828
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:01,260
Yeah, you're pretty.

829
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,620
Because I love you.

830
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:24,120
♫ I will close my two eyes ♫

831
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:29,490
♫ So that I won't see you ♫

832
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:35,680
♫ Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt ♫

833
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,630
♫ And I'll grit my teeth like this ♫

834
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:46,030
♫ I'll hold back my tears. Don't worry ♫

835
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:53,720
♫ Please just go the way you were going ♫

836
01:16:53,720 --> 01:17:01,200
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

837
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,200
[Hwayugi]

838
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,980
Why are you here?

839
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,680
To find the mermaid together with you.

840
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,350
The person the mermaid loves is the librarian here.

841
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:13,480
Why wasn't she able to receive that man's love?

842
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,660
She must have lost her love to a human.

843
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,860
She shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

844
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,750
I shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

845
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,400
She probably wants to kill him.

846
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,310
What are you doing?

847
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:29,070
I told you, didn't I? If you're in the slightest bit of danger,

848
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:31,740
my heart is in danger.
