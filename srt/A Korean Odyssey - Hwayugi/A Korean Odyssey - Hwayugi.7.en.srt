5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,400
Hyungnim, it's ginseng soup.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,510
- It will help with your cold.
- Yes.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,000
Cold?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,520
Yes. Hyungnim was in the snow.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,900
Snow? It snowed today?

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,720
It did for a short time, and because I was snowed on, I got something called the cold.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,760
There's no way your body will catch a cold...

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,410
Is that so? Hey, Zombie, do you want to die? You told me it was a cold.

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,590
It is a cold.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,190
You had a slight fever after being snowed on, and you said you felt itchy.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,520
Since I'm already dead, there won't be any instances where I will catch a cold,

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,910
but I definitely remember about colds.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,190
Anyway, I don't feel too well because of this cold.

18
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,020
At times like this, if I drank a lot of warm sake, I would feel better.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,320
Are you sure you have a cold?

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,590
An illness such as a cold is classified as a very minor illness.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,770
Is there a possibility that it could be a more serious disease?

22
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,580
No.

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,920
That's disappointing. But I guess a sickness is a sickness.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,170
Why? Are you happy that I'm sick?

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,810
Of course, I'm happy.

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,520
So happy that you've been flashing winks at me for the past few minutes?

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,870
This is a side-effect, and it's all because of you.

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,620
It's hideous to see. Sorry.

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,110
To share your pain, do you want me to take part in it with you? Huh? Huh?

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,140
Hey, Jin Bu Ja, you do it too.

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,640
Okay.

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,960
But recently, my eyes keep falling out, so I can't wink well.

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,620
Then, at least I should...

34
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,480
Don't do it!

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,940
Alright. I won't do it.

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,440
It will get better soon.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,130
Something very joyful is going to happen.

38
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,190
What joyful event?

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,670
It's work-related. That being said ...

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,180
I'm planning on inviting someone over to this house.

41
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,170
Whom are you inviting?

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,010
He's a movie director from America.

43
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,050
He is a very smart and gentle human.

44
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,910
But then to invite humans, I'm going to need a human's help.

45
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,350
So I plan on inviting Sam Jang over, too.

46
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,200
It's okay, right, Great Sage?

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,850
Do whatever you want.

48
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,310
Then I will invite both of them and let them meet each other.

49
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,370
Do you remember me?

50
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,930
Yes.

51
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,720
Look forward to it too, Great Sage.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,110
It's going to be very interesting.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,110
Ma Wang, do you want me to punch your eye?

54
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,630
No thanks. My eye will get better soon.

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,010
You worry about your eye.

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,030
Now I can do it!

57
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,890
But I can't open my eyes!

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,340
You made me lose my appetite for the soup!

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,430
Bu Ja, your eyes have rolled back.

60
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,630
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,150
Why do my eyes keep falling out and rolling back?

62
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,190
Why did you tell a zombie to wink

63
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,390
and cause her eyes to roll back?

64
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,550
A corpse that should be lying down with her eyes closed is winking her eyes instead, so she's living in luxury.

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,480
- Yes, I'm living a luxurious life.
- Zombie, come over here.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,360
I'll hit the back of your head so let's reinsert your eyeballs after they fall out. Come over here.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,630
I look hideous when my eyeballs fall out. I look like a zombie!

68
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,820
Hey, a zombie should be like a zombie. Hey, come over here!

69
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,780
Hey, hey. I'll make it work in one hit. Come. Come here, Zombie!

70
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,200
That nut job of a monkey.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,120
Soon, from your two eyes,

72
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,950
I will make you shed bloody tears of jealousy.

73
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,380
Soon.

74
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,160
Did you ask what you've been wanting to know during the time that the Geumganggo was frozen?

75
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,790
Son Oh Gong, what I want to know is...

76
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,130
am I pretty right now?

77
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,090
Yeah, you're pretty.

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,850
Because I love you.

79
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,780
At that exact moment, out of all times, it stopped snowing.

80
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,550
They were like his usual words, but at the same time not.

81
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,690
What were they like?

82
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,770
Usually he says, "Because I love you." Like that.

83
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,540
But during that time, he said, "Because I love you." Like that.

84
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,710
- They are the same.
- They aren't!

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,460
Someone who used to say "Because I love you"

86
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,430
said "Because I love you." This is what he did!

87
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,170
I'm more confused because I needlessly asked.

88
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,200
There's nothing to be confused about.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,500
My brother can't freeze the Geumganggo. I am stronger.

90
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,540
What good is it if the Winter General freezes it if the Summer Fairy melts it at the same time?

91
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,550
Then both of you were teasing me?

92
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,270
General Winter and Summer Fairy. To a demon brother and sister pair, I got played?

93
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,590
That is why you should hang out with humans, not demons.

94
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,670
There's no one who will hang out with me.

95
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,870
If there was someone like that, I would have also liked a human.

96
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,190
Still, is that a reason to like a demon?

97
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,690
Who likes a demon?

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,860
Jin Seon Mi, don't be confused

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,700
and please find a person you can love.

100
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,730
If you keep getting your heart stolen by a demon, it becomes dangerous.

101
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,810
That's right. Getting my heart stolen is dangerous.

102
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,890
- What's dangerous?
- You scared me!

103
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,700
- If it was dangerous, why didn't you call me?
- Why are you here if I didn't call you?

104
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,120
I came because I wanted to see you. I also have something to give you.

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,400
You got snowed on. Eat warm porridge before you sleep so you don't catch a cold.

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,940
Sa Oh Jeong made it.

107
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,480
You're saying someone who makes cell phones made porridge for me?

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,530
My Oh Jeong loves to cook.

109
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,420
If you eat deliciously for him, he smiles so cutely.

110
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,020
Tell your younger brother that I will eat it deliciously.

111
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,200
Tell him yourself. If you open the lid and talk, Sa Oh Jeong can hear you.

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

113
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,630
I'll it eat well. Thank you, Sa Oh Jeong.

114
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,030
- He isn't replying.
- Is he in the middle of a phone call? Leave a message.

115
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,360
- A message?
- Yeah!

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,290
Or would you like to make a video call?

117
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,600
- You're teasing me right now, aren't you?
- Of course.

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,790
You're an idiot. You believed that.

119
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,750
I mean, is a thermos a cell phone?

120
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,070
- Are you having fun teasing a human?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,660
Now it should work. Give it a try.

122
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,900
Forget it. I'm going to use a phone.

123
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,070
Because I'm a human, I have to use this.

124
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,020
After hanging out with someone like you,

125
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,890
I keep getting confused and do ridiculous things.

126
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,760
You're mad because I tried to kill you, aren't you?

127
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,430
What is there to be mad at? I'm an idiot.

128
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,310
The strongest predator who can eat me is you.

129
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,290
Since you're too friendly as a predator, I was confused into thinking I was safe.

130
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,720
Is that so? I've become sure.

131
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,900
I couldn't leave you to disappear.

132
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,200
Before then, my heart will break into pieces.

133
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,730
So you're not going to die. Unless I do.

134
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,270
Because of the Geumganggo?

135
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah.

136
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You don't have to worry anymore. You're safe, Sam Jang.

137
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,060
It's the truth, so trust me.

138
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,470
How can I trust you when you're always conning me?

139
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,630
Eat something warm, sleep well, and if you have something to say, leave a message.

140
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,680
Are you trying to trick me again? I don't believe you!

141
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,670
Oh, he left.

142
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,730
What am I looking forward to?

143
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,970
Am I pretty now?

144
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,670
Yeah, you're pretty.

145
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,720
Because I love you.

146
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,600
That was all fake. I won't be fooled.

147
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm also sure now.

148
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,150
I won't believe anything! I will never, ever believe anything!

149
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,760
You're lying. You do believe.

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,990
Jin Seon Mi, when you were young and even now, you get fooled too easily.

151
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,160
I'm hanging up!

152
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,600
Let's not get fooled.

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,090
If I get bewitched by a demon, it's dangerous.

154
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,530
Where are you?

155
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,270
At the library. Nobody's here at this hour. It's awesome.

156
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,850
Don't you know about the school library rumor? They say a ghost appears there.

157
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,460
Ghost?

158
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,590
It's scary so that's why nobody goes there. You should hurry home, too.

159
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,250
Yeah right.

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,660
Why is she looking at me?

161
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,600
There's no ghost here.

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,220
But a really pretty girl is here!

163
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,870
You moved seats quite fast.

164
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,760
They say the library ghost is really pretty...

165
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,740
And... that she has no legs.

166
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,350
What are you doing?

167
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,570
Look over here.

168
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,880
Lowly demon, I'm this way.

169
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,440
Are you the one who called me?

170
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

171
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,670
How did you end up here?

172
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,730
First get me out of here.

173
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,010
I will escort you, Prince.

174
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,170
The octopus in here is the scumbag, the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea?

175
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes, because he was punished, he had lost his demonic powers. That's when he was caught in a net.

176
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,370
I quickly placed him in here and escorted him

177
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,870
from the fish market where he could've been sold for sushi.

178
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,140
He is sleeping right now.

179
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,350
They said Jade Dragon got kicked out after selling medicine to mermaids that turned them into humans.

180
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,660
He really showed up in this state.

181
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,850
Ma Wang, you and the Dragon King of the East Sea are acquaintances, so why don't you take him in?

182
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,260
I will take my leave as there is an urgent meeting for me to attend.

183
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,310
Taking in a monkey and a zombie is already too much for me.

184
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,480
Adding this octopus is overdoing it.

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,370
Why don't you take care of it?

186
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,980
Then I will take my leave, as I have a golf appointment.

187
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,260
One moment! You have to take it in!

188
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,790
Who's going to take this in? Ma Wang! Wait!

189
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,580
Ma Wang!

190
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,080
Why can't I audition for the upcoming movie?

191
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,380
Alice, your acting is crappy.

192
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,540
I will speak directly with Chairman Woo Hwi.

193
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,610
That will not do.

194
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,260
Then, shall I barge into his house?

195
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,490
Please wait a moment. I'll speak to the Chairman.

196
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,640
Should I kill her?

197
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,480
Oh my. The prince has escaped.

198
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm so pissed off.

199
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,780
How dare she say the word "crappy" to me?

200
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,670
What is this? This is an octopus tentacle.

201
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,870
Oh my! Oh my! Go away!

202
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,990
Go away! Get lost!

203
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,300
- Alice?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,300
You're not Alice.

205
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,970
Did I get caught?

206
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,010
Are you the prince?

207
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:54,010
That's right. I'm the second son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, Jade Dragon.

208
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,840
Why don't you put your legs together? Gosh.

209
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,440
Jade Dragon, return to the sea.

210
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,910
I'll explain the situation well to your father.

211
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,940
I can't go back now. I have to find something.

212
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,840
When I have found it, I will return this body to its owner.

213
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,490
You can't carelessly walk around in that body.

214
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,360
Why? Is there a problem with this body?

215
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,390
For a human, isn't it a pretty decent body?

216
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,900
Geez!

217
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,500
She doesn't smell. She seems healthy.

218
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,880
Stop it. That body is our agency's precious celebrity.

219
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,350
She's famous. If you do that in front of others, it's the end.

220
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,500
Did I choose the wrong one?

221
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,500
I can't move into another body for a while.

222
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,760
Alice has an important commercial shoot this morning, what should we do?

223
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,400
I'll do it.

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,660
In return, the person I'm looking for, you find her.

225
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,910
Hey, Secretary Ma. Place Jeo Pal Gye to assist him and get through the schedule.

226
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,610
I'll go look for Sam Jang.

227
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,220
Will you be alright?

228
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,890
What if you suffer side effects?

229
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,890
I can overcome them.

230
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,320
CEO, do you really have nothing going on between you and Secretary Son?

231
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,030
Yes, there's nothing. He simply protects me.

232
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,830
Then by any chance, would you like to try going on a blind date?

233
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,720
My junior who came by the office last time eagerly asked me to introduce you to him.

234
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,920
Would it be okay with you if you introduced me to your junior?

235
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,420
He was the president of a mystery club. He totally loves scary things.

236
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,330
He has a stable job.

237
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,710
He's a really smooth guy, just like this coffee.

238
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,390
He's way better than that thug-like Secretary Son. Oh my gosh!

239
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,160
What's the matter?

240
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,200
What's mysterious these days is

241
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,200
that bad things happen whenever I say bad things about Secretary Son.

242
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,990
Out of nowhere, things fall and chairs slip out from under me.

243
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,720
You almost got hurt.

244
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,380
You're listening, right?

245
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,590
Don't come here and play jokes ever again.

246
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,880
Mr. Lee Han Joo, in the future,

247
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,960
don't say bad things about him even when he's not present.

248
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,600
It's dangerous.

249
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,870
Yes.

250
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,960
Ah, CEO...

251
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,600
About that blind date, I think it'd be better to not to do it. You're busy.

252
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,710
If he is a man as smooth as coffee, I wanted to meet him at least once.

253
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,490
Oh, my wife, I'm really scared.

254
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,010
I was a bit scared, but just a moment ago, I was really scared.

255
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,480
Should I just quit?

256
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,700
Hold on.

257
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,580
Today, you came here personally.

259
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,930
Yes, there is an important matter to take care of.

260
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,760
- Does my CEO have an important event today also?
- Yes.

261
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,510
But she's not appearing on television.

262
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,890
What kind of event is she participating in?

263
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,370
This time it's an important event

264
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,980
related to a member of a royal family who has traveled from far away.

265
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,470
- A banquet for VIPS?
- Well, you could say that.

266
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,010
I understand.

267
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,070
Then, I'll be going.

268
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,350
Please enter.

269
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,260
Hello?

270
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,070
Wifey, Chairman Woo Hwi is acting very friendly towards me.

271
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,670
I think I should continue working here.

272
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,500
We have to think of Han Byeol's future too.

273
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,830
The son of the Dragon King came to find a mermaid?

274
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,980
Yes, they say he sold medicine that makes legs appear

275
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,480
to a mermaid who was in love with a human.

276
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,050
Why do you keep doing that?

277
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,770
It's a... small side effect.

278
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,630
One moment. Geez.

279
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,380
All we have to do is find that mermaid and send her back to the sea.

281
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,740
If she's a mermaid, she's a demon. Can a demon love a human?

282
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,370
It's not impossible. You're also receiving the love of a demon.

283
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,180
That's fake love that originates from the Geumganggo.

284
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
You're not confused and are accurately informed.

285
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,770
That's fake, yes.

286
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,800
Because Sam Jang is human, it's natural that she receives love from a human.

287
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,200
There is no one like that.

288
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,190
What if he did exist? How would you feel?

289
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,990
If there was someone who loved you,

290
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,350
would you be able to love him back?

291
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,870
Of course. If there's anyone who says he likes me, please introduce him to me.

292
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,060
So I can try my hand at dating.

293
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,600
Then, please find the mermaid.

294
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,730
I'll find a human for Sam Jang.

295
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,250
If Sam Jang dates,

296
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,230
someone's heart will be torn to shreds.

297
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,630
He didn't come to rescue a mermaid but to kill a human who betrayed her?

298
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,250
He said to give this knife to the mermaid when you find her.

299
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,920
A mermaid who can't earn the love of a human can't return to the sea safely.

300
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,380
She must stab the human's heart with that knife so she doesn't disappear.

301
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,600
If Ma Wang who keeps talking about becoming a deity finds out about this, he won't help find the mermaid.

302
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,130
Yes, that's why the Dragon King's son has already asked me.

303
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,180
If you find the mermaid and give her this knife, she will give you a shingiru.

304
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,480
Ah, a shingiru?
[Mermaid's tear that allows a realistic virtual reality experience]

305
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,130
But I don't particularly have anything I want to try with that.

306
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,530
What about alcohol?

307
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,540
You'll be able to drink it as if you were drinking it for real.

308
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh Jeong, I better catch that mermaid immediately. Where do I have to go to catch it?

309
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,710
I already found out what kind of water a mermaid would play in.

310
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,630
If you choose the right bait, you will be able to catch the mermaid easily.

311
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,670
- Bait?
- Yes.

312
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,770
To catch a demon, there's no better bait than Sam Jang.

313
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,950
Hey, you just...

314
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,110
Our lucky bundle, Oh Jeong! Aw, you're so cute.

315
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,620
Right. The bait is Sam Jang.

316
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,250
Oh? Why are you here?

317
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,450
To find the mermaid together with you.

318
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,100
I can do that alone.

319
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,690
I told you, didn't I? If you're in the slightest bit of danger,

320
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,240
my heart is in danger.

321
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,590
You're making a big deal.

322
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,630
They say the mermaid resides in this school.

323
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,920
Was there anyone suspicious? Nothing has been bothering you around here?

324
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,550
I just got here. They say that the human that the mermaid loves is at this school.

325
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,200
For certain, she'll be in his vicinity.

326
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,730
Then, quickly start walking around the area. The bait has to move around so the fish can bite.

327
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,620
Bait?

328
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,430
Bait? Who? You?

329
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,780
Who said you're bait? Ma Wang?!

330
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,070
What a bad rascal of a bull! How dare he speak so carelessly!

331
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,300
Who does he think he's kidding? Seriously!

[A world that is opened by a book]

333
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,930
The person the mermaid loves is the librarian here.

334
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,310
It must be him.

335
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,650
I guess she must be hanging around him.

336
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,510
We'll set up camp here and if you're here, she'll come.

337
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,020
That mermaid even abandoned the sea she used to live in.

338
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,400
Why wasn't she able to receive that man's love?

339
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,440
She must have lost her love to a human.

340
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,410
Did you eat?

341
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,810
No, let's go to a cafe.

342
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,420
- You have to eat, so why would we go to a cafe?
- Let's drink coffee.

343
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,810
Ah, I see.

344
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,160
That man found a human he likes.

345
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,150
If she's watching from nearby, she must want to die from a heartbreak.

346
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,160
You're wrong. She probably wants to kill him.

347
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,910
Would she be able to kill him even if she loves him?

348
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,640
She shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

349
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,290
Do you feel sorry for the mermaid?

350
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,440
Then what about me?

351

I'm also in the same position.

353

I shouldn't have started this kind of love from the beginning.

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,340
Ugh, my head hurts.

As expected, the energy from these books doesn't suit me.

What happens if Sam Jang ends up loving a different human man?

358
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,650
That rascal's heart will probably be torn to pieces.

359
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,290
Since Jonathan accepted my invitation, things are going according to my plan.

360
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,960
If it's according to your plan, Jonathan will soon get to meet his first love, Jin Seon Mi.

361
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,190
That's right. While the two people are reuniting,

362
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,270
I will make sure Son Oh Gong will be watching from one side.

363
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,130
Watch.

364
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,770
Like from behind a pillar. Like this.

365
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:07,380
It comes out often in dramas, hiding behind a pillar or a wall, looking so miserable.

366
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,160
Like this. Crying.

367
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,050
Just the thought of seeing that image

368
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,690
is so satisfying.

369
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,510
But will he be able to recognize Jin Seon Mi, whom he saw as a child?

370
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,160
Of course he won't be able to, so I have to let him know in advance.

371
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,980
That I found the little kid, his first love.

372
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,750
It may be certain, but it isn't romantic.

373
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,070
If I just let them meet and they don't recognize each other, my plan will fail.

374
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,660
If the two are destined for each other, isn't a fated meeting possible?

00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,200
Secretary Ma, you've watched too many dramas.

How is such a meeting possible?

378

Yes, thank you.

Ah, before then, I have a favor to ask.

380
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,850
Not long ago in a park, I took some nice photos.

381

I saw a person in the photos at this company.

382
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,630
I want to give her the photos.

383
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,240
Do you think you can find her?

384
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,260
- This person—
- Jonathan, the woman that appeared in the photo at Jamulsae Park...

385

Are you still searching for her?

Yeah, because the pictures came out so nice there.

Naturally, I prefer a planned meeting under my control. That's more certain.

Yes, I understand.

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,360
Did you put kimchi in there? Where do you expect her to stay?

473
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,220
These days, the weather is cold so the balcony is colder than the fridge.

474
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,920
Hyungnim, you don't have to make a decision right away so please think about it prudently.

475
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,580
Damn. Ah, whiskey... tequila...

476
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:27,310
Son Oh Gong, why are you using such a good opportunity to drink?

477
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,490
If it were me, I would see someone I really miss.

478
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:36,710
Hey, your brain is rotten so you don't even remember whom you miss!

479
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:43,270
Even though I don't remember, I'm certain that there was someone I missed.

480
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,760
Because I was a person.

481
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,790
The people you miss will probably not like it when they see you.

482
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,250
Because now, you're not a person.

483
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,100
Zombie. You are a zombie.

484
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,620
How dare you look at me like that?!

485
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,810
Hey, at that rate, you might bite!

486
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,570
Fine. Bite me! Bite me!

487
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,090
Just try and bite me. I'll burn everything up.

488
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,510
- Oh Jeong.
- Yes.

489
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,790
Let's go with my first choice, warm sake.

490
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,420
For sake, barbecued skewers are also nice.

491
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,210
- Barbecued skewers!
- Eels are better than skewers.

492
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,650
With eels, you have to drink soju!

493
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,780
Hey, Zombie! I should just—

494
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,580
Gosh, I got confused again!

495
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:12,270
When a mermaid gets hit by water, she will reveal her true identity.

496
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,240
It's you.

497
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,800
He said if you get hit by water, a tail would emerge.

498
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,970
Why don't you even have legs?

499
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,250
Stop right there.

500
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,730
♫ To catch it, where should I go?

501
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,310
I caught it.

502
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,070
He was already here.

503
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,020
Son Oh Gong.

504
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,420
- Just a moment ago, that was the mermaid, right?
- Yeah.

505
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,250
But why doesn't she have legs or a tail?

506
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,960
I don't know. In any case, I finished my task.

507
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,620
Let's go.

508
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,820
- You're finished?
- Is she going back to the sea?

509
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,650
She said she would take care of it.

510
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,460
It looked like you gave her something. What is it?

511
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,690
Something that a friend from the sea relayed to her.

512
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,130
Now she will make the decision.

513
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,420
By chance, it's not dangerous, is it?

514
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,420
To whom? To humans?

515
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,870
If she is going to harm humans, we have to stop her.

516
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,860
I don't want to. Why should I?

517
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,400
I've finished my task so I'm leaving.

518
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,040
[Missed calls]
[Lee Han Joo]

519
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,700
CEO, why aren't you answering the phone?

520
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,920
Your friend kept waiting for you.

521
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,000
Friend?

522
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,470
He said he was a childhood friend.

523
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,590
I don't have any childhood friends.

524
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,420
One moment, I'll put him on the phone.

525
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,370
Please take the phone.

526
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,410
Thank you.

527
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,560
Seon Mi?

528
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,390
If she's watching from nearby, she must want to die from a heartbreak.

529
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:54,860
You're wrong. She probably wants to kill him.

530
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,030
No way.

531
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,800
Hello?

532
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,360
I gave that knife to that mermaid.

533
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,780
Give me what you promised.

534
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,820
What do you mean by knife?

535
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,020
You didn't return her to the sea without making a fuss?

536
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,970
She already couldn't return without creating a fuss.

537
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,810
What trick did the two of you play?

538
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,070
What happened to the mermaid?

539
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,940
Because a mermaid's love is unconditional, she sacrifices everything and gives her all.

540
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,960
She gave everything to the ever selfish human and got discarded.

541
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:53,300
I came to relay the knife that will be used to stab the heart of that traitor.

542
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,190
You rascal. You dared to use me to harm a human?

543
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,260
Don't rush to get angry.

544
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,210
Anyway, that mermaid can't harm a human.

545
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,490
What?

546
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:12,900
I told you. That mermaid was already in a state where she is unable to return without making a fuss.

547
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,090
The mermaid was already dead.

548
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,880
What is this?

549
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,540
- Who are you?
- You killed that woman, didn't you?

550
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,330
What's that? Wasn't she a human?

551
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,020
- She was a mermaid.
- Mermaid?

552
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,780
No wonder. She was so obedient that I thought she was dim-witted.

553
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,900
She wasn't a human?

554
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,860
Then I'm not a murderer anymore.

555
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,190
The mermaid will punish you.

556
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,210
The idea that a mermaid will forgive everything, turn into bubbles, and get lost

557
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,930
is a fairy tale made up by humans.

558
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,970
You are...

559
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:13,400
That's a thorn that will stay stuck in your heart forever to give you pain.

560
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,630
Now you'll be able to return to the sea.

561
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,210
Since she didn't kill a human, it won't be a huge problem.

562
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,300
Even if it does become a problem, please don't involve me.

563
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,700
That rascal of a monkey did it without telling me to get a shingiru.

564
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:16,500
The Great Sage, after meeting a mermaid who was betrayed by a human,

565
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,900
must really not feel like drinking.

566
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,350
Would that selfish rascal lose his appetite for drinking because he feels sorry for the mermaid?

567
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:29,130
That rascal. That incident from long ago probably resurfaced for him.

568
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,650
By that incident, you mean...

569
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:41,510
Son Oh Gong that rascal also got used by a human and was badly betrayed.

570
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:47,200
That arrogant rascal was punished for that incident and was trapped in Five Elements Mountain.

571
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,660
He must have been tormented for several hundred years.

572
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,670
He got played while putting on airs.

573
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,700
Miss Jin Seon Mi?

574
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,420
It's the first time having both of you here.

575
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,270
Quickly, take a seat.

576
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:35,400
You knew about it all along, didn't you? Why didn't you tell me?

577
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,540
Because I'm a human, you thought I would try to stop the mermaid from exacting her revenge?

578
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,180
Yeah. Humans are selfish and can't be trusted.

579
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:48,370
Son Oh Gong, earlier you asked me if you and that mermaid were both pitiful in the same way, right?

580
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,930
It's not the same. I don't feel pity for you at all.

581
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:57,990
Because I like being with you.

582
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,370
Even if your feelings are fake, I'm thankful and glad that you love me.

583
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,320
It's the truth.

584
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,840
The human who got stabbed probably said the same thing as you in the beginning.

585
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:22,220
That's right. Because humans can't be trusted, I also think that I can change.

586
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:28,650
If I ever only use you and betray you, you can also stab me.

587
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,760
I told you, didn't I? You can't die until I die.

588
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,720
Then I'll take off the Geumganggo. If I take it off, nothing will happen to you.

589
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,510
Stab me.

590
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:51,990
A contract.

591
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,990
We need to sign a contract?

592
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,090
Why? You want to look like a trustworthy person but don't want to take the responsibility?

593
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,200
That's sneaky.

594
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,980
I mean, it's burdensome.

595
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,420
We shouldn't really let an incident occur that ends in a stabbing.

596
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,610
I'm saying just in case. Just in case.

597
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:16,120
If you could have a realistic virtual experience, what do you want to do?

598
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,520
People whom I miss but can't meet. I want to see them.

599
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,680
You don't have anyone around you. So whom do you miss?

600
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,820
My grandmother. Since I can't see my maternal grandmother again,

601
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,790
I want to go back to when I was young and meet Grandmother.

602
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,120
It's the whiskey you always order.

603
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,650
I'm sorry for drinking by myself.

604
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:48,240
Don't worry about it. I'll have a chance to drink soon, too.

605
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,790
Whiskey would be nice as well.

606
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,860
You waited a long time but you couldn't see her. What are you going to do?

607
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,570
I couldn't see her today. There's tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

608
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,530
Okay, see you next day.

609
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,990
Also, I need some important information.

610
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:24,040
Does Seon Mi have a boyfriend?

611
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,440
Get lost.

612
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,320
- No.
- Good.

613
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,120
- Good.
- Great.

614
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,500
- Good.
- Thank you.

615
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,340
- Okay.
- Alright.

616
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,940
If you escaped and tried to harm a person,

617
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,790
I really wouldn't have left you alone.

618
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,060
Since this incident passed by smoothly,

619
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,090
return to the sea now.

620
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,890
Secretary Ma.

621
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,150
I'm jealous.

622
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:13,760
Now, come out of Alice's body and get inside this.

623
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,560
I will safely escort you to the East Sea.

624
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,140
The water is too dirty.

625
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,720
- Change it to mineral water.
- Yes.

626
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,060
I still can't go.

627
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,020
Why? Why? Why? WHY?!

628
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,370
That knife is a treasure from the dragon sea palace.

629
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,920
Also, I stole a shingiru.

630
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,060
If I go, my father will kill me. I can't go.

631

637
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,770
Shall I report to you some good news?

638
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:07,880
What is it?

639
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,720
The love between Sam Jang and the man you intended for her has already started.

640
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,050
How?

641
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,260
That is, one moment.

653
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,990
I really wanted to drink that!

654
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,560
You have chosen whiskey.

655
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,900
Then I will make the most premium side dish to go with the whiskey.

Yes, I dreamed a really nice dream. It felt so real.

00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,440
By any chance was it about a pig? Don't you have to buy a lottery ticket?

00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,650
It was a dream about my grandmother who passed away.

They say dreams about ancestors are also good. Buy a lottery ticket.

Ah, that's right. Our CEO isn't someone who needs to win money from the lottery.

He was an oppa who liked me when I was young.

The mother collapsed while looking for her missing daughter and is in the hospital in a critical state.

01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,600
You're the only one in this world who can kill me.

792
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,240
Son Oh Gong.

793
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,730
If you tell me to die, I'll die.

794
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:34,030
Thank you.

795
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:37,250
I love you, Jin Seon Mi.
