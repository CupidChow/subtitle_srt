[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,710
Soon, a sword will appear.

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,280
With that sword, you'll end up stabbing Sam Jang.

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,540
That sword can never be destroyed.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,470
For her summons, Sam Jang will be sacrificed,

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:42,230
and if you, the Great Sage, carry that deed out using that sword, it will be done.

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,670
The sword I have to use to kill Sam Jang...

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,090
Don't ever come out into this world again.

11
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,100
We're closed now.
[Episode 17]

12
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,420
Now I have enough power to take care of something at your level.

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,210
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,080
I don't think this kind of thing is something that will save the world.

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,650
The Great Sage took the sword that was given by the heavenly realm.

16
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,430
I heard it's a sword given to kill Sam Jang who will be the sacrifice.

17
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,280
He might have decided to die rather than use the sword.

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,470
Geumganggo's control on the Great Sage is stronger than I expected.

19
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,710
At first, the peddler didn't say that it would be strong like this.

20
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,690
The peddler recommended Geumganggo to me.

21
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,810
You've been abusing me since then.

22
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,470
Jin Seon Mi didn't become Sam Jang because I sent her to Five Elements Mountain.

23
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,230
Her fate was decided upon her birth. You knew that as well.

24
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,810
You've lied to me about this as well.

25
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,930
Thanks to that, you got a lot of points towards becoming a deity.

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,180
Now I am no longer interested in that.

27
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,700
Working for you has been a waste of energy.

28
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,370
I will find a way to return to the original me.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,460
Goodbye.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,990
Now it's Sam Jang.

31
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,050
I was waiting for you.

32
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,220
I came because I have something to discuss with you.

33
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,450
My bull's horn isn't a coat hanger.

34
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,600
I am sorry. It was because Oh Gong would hang his coats there.

35
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,210
You're here alone.

36
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,580
Is Son Oh Gong not here?

37
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,070
Yes.

38
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,300
Today, I saw the world ending again but something was odd.

39
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,720
The sky did look weird.

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,590
Your summons must be getting closer.

41
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,470
It was destruction that could be done by a human, not an evil spirit.

42
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,700
Do you think it means that someone with very strong powers will arise?

43
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,120
In the end, the thing that will destroy the world will be human beings.

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,460
That's why you, a human being, have to save the world.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,190
It means that the heavens are telling humans to negotiate and come to terms.

46
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,790
In any case, I won't be involved with your matters anymore.

47
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,860
How can you say that?

48
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,280
Everything started because of you.

49
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,630
I intervened when I shouldn't have only because I was deceived.

50
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,200
Even so, how can you drop out now?

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,440
Once you intervene, you should help out until the end.

52
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,160
Even if I want to help,

53
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,240
I am too weak lately.

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,650
Haven't you recovered yet?

55
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,810
Exactly.

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,090
Aren't there ways you can get better?

57
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,920
It's not that there isn't a way.

58
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,160
Will you help me?

59
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,620
How can I help you?

60
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,780
Sam Jang, you've heard about why Ja Eun turned into a demon, right?

61
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,040
I heard that in order to save her own child, she fed her child with human children's souls after capturing them.

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,430
That's right. She fed him human children's souls

63
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:52,180
because that child was a demon since he's my son.

64
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:03,440
As for demons... they get stronger by eating a human's energy.

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,620
In fact, more than the energy beads I have been consuming nowadays,

66
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,140
it's better if I can eat the energy from a live human.

67
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:20,140
Furthermore, if the energy is from a very special person...

68
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,490
there is nothing better.

69
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,910
You will cry.

70
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,060
Excuse me?

71
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,020
I saw you crying so sadly.

72
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,460
I think someone must have died.

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,850
Ma Wang!

74
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,690
I found good medicine.

75
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,770
You were here as well, Great Sage.

76
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,460
Hey, Dog Secretary, you brought another medicine?

77
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,600
If you find something good, you should share.

78
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,820
There is nothing to share at this time, too.

79
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,360
Cheapskate.

80
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,970
I should get a cat secretary for myself.

81
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,150
You have Sam Jang.

82
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,560
Being by her side should be better than any medicine out there.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,130
Ma Wang, I will prepare the medicine.

84
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,930
What do mean by Ma Wang will cry?

85
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,980
I don't know what the situation was but I saw Ma Wang cry so sadly.

86
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,710
Now you seem to have an ability to foresee.

87
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,150
Yes, recently, I've been able to see short fragments of the future.

88
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,630
I think you will lose something very precious to you.

89
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,660
I will take it as advice to be careful in the future.

90
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,190
Right, Ma Wang. You shouldn't make a sad thing happen to you.

91
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,450
I heard from Elder Soo Boo Ri. You'd better worry about yourself.

92
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,260
Sam Jang is slowly getting stronger by the day.

93
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,040
I should go take my medicine.

94
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,630
What really happened between you and Elder Soo Boo Ri?

95
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,300
- It was nothing.
- Did you argue with him?

96
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,470
I threw a tantrum in front of all the deities because I got so mad.

97
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,690
I don't think I can get promoted. It's okay with you, right?

98
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,930
No. You should have taken me along with you.

99
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,250
I have a lot to complain about as well.

100
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,240
Now I can make things break and throw things when I get angry, too.

101
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,980
Ah, I want to throw a tantrum, too.

102
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,580
Sure. Let's do that together next time.

103
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,280
When you throw a tantrum, you must act fast. Just destroy anything you can see first.

104
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,660
Right. I will destroy everything

105
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,450
saying if one dares to mess with my Oh Gong, I won't let it slide.

106
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,630
How reassuring.

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,890
I have this now. Try calling my name.

108
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,740
Jin Seon Mi.

109
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,190
But I still can't appear right next to you, with a "ta-da" effect.

110
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,570
You want to?

111
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,700
Well. If I could, that would be nice.

112
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,880
Jin Seon Mi.

113
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,540
Hey.

114
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,020
Since I called your name, you came right away.

115
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,190
Because you did it. But either way, it feels good.

116
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,450
Call me whenever you need me.

117
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,940
Really? I can call you whenever?

118
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:05,020
Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, it's all fine?

119
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,630
No, call me on my cell phone or send me a message first.

120
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,270
Moving you is quite tiring and hard.

121
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,420
Just call me instead without being scared.

122
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm telling you to not be scared to call my name.

123
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:35,120
Son Oh Gong, is it really okay if I don't take off the Geumganggo?

124
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,430
I promised I would take it off.

125
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,560
If that just doesn't exist, your feelings now will disappear.

126
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,100
Then you won't need to be in danger because of me.

127
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,110
Will everything really disappear? All of it?

128
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,440
You believe that it will be so. I used to believe it too.

129
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,670
But I must have gone insane.

130
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,200
I like you more and more.

131
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,270
Even in this moment while I look at you, you're getting prettier.

132
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,320
But you think that all of this will really disappear in a second?

133
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,790
Can you truly believe that?

134
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,190
Before, it was too saddening

135
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,990
but now I think it's rather a relief.

136
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,020
Because it's a way to let you go for your heart to be at peace.

137
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,640
Okay, later when you call me and I don't come,

138
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,670
it's because all my feelings have disappeared.

139
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,590
I'm going to be busy for a while.

140
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,820
Whatever I do, don't be surprised.

141
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,990
Bye.

142
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,340
When do you think Ah Sa Nyeo will come back?

143
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,500
She lied to get out of the situation, so she won't be able to come back.

144
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,580
I wish she would come.

145
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,330
She just needs to bring even a tiny clue.

146
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm preparing the medicine. Please take it and go to sleep.

147
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,610
No, rather than medicine, I want some alcohol.

148
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,770
Is it certain that this is a body that does not have any family members?

149
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,200
He seems to be a youth that has frozen to death after running away from home.

150
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,560
We're looking for his family.

151
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,600
For him to be without family, we can't have found his family, right?

152
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,710
Yes, I will make it so.

153
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,590
He looks clean without any external scars. This will do.

154
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,520
What are you planning to do with this kind of thing?

155
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,090
Is he some kind of sacrifice to summon a dragon?

156
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,390
That is not an easy job.

157
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:39,470
For now, I will make him a son for someone who dearly misses him.

158
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,160
I just need to feed this thing with a human's soul.

159
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,760

Do I have to get such things for you as well?

161
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,560
No, you don't have to. There are a few that I've stored here until now.

162
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,040
By souls... you mean that there are dead people here?

165
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,840
You're right. I killed you.

That's why you came to me now like this.

169

You probably heard about it already, but I need to catch a big evil spirit.

276
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,900
First, I have to find the human who will be possessed by that evil spirit.

277
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,430
If a big evil spirit plans to possess a human to exercise tremendous power,

278
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,520
then it will choose a human with some power.

279

When I heard that Secretary Son is from M Group's family,

With the amount of evil power Ah Sa Nyeo has,

You're right. It can't be Ah Sa Nyeo.

Ah Sa Nyeo said she would summon a dragon for Kang Dae Seong.

A dragon is an auspicious symbol.

Don't do that. I don't even want to imagine it.

Ma Wang, did you have a dream?

473
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,360
No, it wasn't a dream.

474
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,130
It feels like I went somewhere for a while.

475
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,510
So it's true that Ah Sa Nyeo went to Kang Dae Seong.

476
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,500
Because he's an evil person, did an evil spirit like Ah Sa Nyeo stick to him?

477
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,960
I'm sorry.

478
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,640
For asking you about Ah Sa Nyeo when Summer Fairy ended up disappearing because of that woman.

479
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,850
It's alright.

480
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,750
I heard that she was woken up on Kang Dae Seong's family's land.

481
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,420
I know. That divine tree.

482
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,570
There was a river next to it.

483
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,530
Is that valley nearby as well?

484
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,320
A valley?

485
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,260
I saw the person called Kang Dae Seong and Ah Sa Nyeo standing in front of a strange valley.

486
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,120
It was very strange and scary.

487
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,770
I've never felt something so scary like it before.

488
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,810
- A valley?
- Yes.

489
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,360
It seems like she saw the future.

490
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,920
Since it's a place she saw in advance, it must not be meaningless.

491
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,080
She said it was a very scary and strange place.

492
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,960
Ah Sa Nyeo said she would summon the dragon.

493
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Maybe it will happen in that place?

494
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,620
You said it was a place with a river flowing through it near the divine tree?

495
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,170
Find the place Sam Jang saw in her vision.

496
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,630
Yes.

497
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,410
I'll have to have a look as well to see how strange and scary it really is.

498
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,730
Before that, should I take a look at the owner of that land first?

499
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,660
Despite his youth, he sets up such a nice playground for himself.

500
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,400
I heard that he gathered all the public figures from the financial and political worlds in this club,

501
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,990
but you don't get to talk to him

502
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,680
unless you go through Chairman Yoon Dae Sik.

503
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,710
Really?

504
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:41,330
Even more interesting is that he won't even sip a drink when there are abundant foods and drinks.

505
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,930
He only eats ice cream or something.

506
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,890
He's a unique person.

507
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,910
I also heard that he is spending money like water.

508
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:54,120
He hung artwork by Andy Warhol in a bathroom here.

509
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,320
I heard there is a picture by Edward Hopper in the woman's bathroom.

510
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,690
Ah, he came.

511
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,260
There he is.

512
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,300
That's him.

513
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,570
I know. He looks just fine outside.

514
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,770
Ah Sa Nyeo must like having good looking men.

515
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,260
Our Oh Jeong has quite a way of speaking cutely.

516
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,230
I didn't even get to speak a word with him.

517
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,190
If we can have him on our side, he can be a secure financial source for us.

518
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,340
For the election campaign, we need some funds.

519
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,930
I will try to secure him.

520
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:01,100
Professor Kang, it's my turn this time.

521
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,630
It's time for you to help me while supporting me from behind.

522
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,590
I'm not a fan of waiting in line behind people though.

523
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,470
Don't be ambitious.

524
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,000
Let's go have another drink.

525
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,390
I'm fine.

526
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,480
Farewell.
(sounds like the honorific form of "die well")

527
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,500
I'm definitely going to make it this time.

528
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:49,720
I really feel like I hurt a human for real.

529
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,040
You're removing my obstacles very well.

530
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,810
Can you make him take my order, too? How can I do it?

531
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:14,220
We can't let him catch on to us by carelessly messing with it.

532
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,580
By "him" you mean?

533
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,190
The one lending the energy. A sort of... father?

534
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,340
Don't come looking for me from now on.

535
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,210
I no longer have an interest in becoming a deity.

536
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:35,630
An evil spirit that's consuming human souls has appeared.

537
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:39,270
Is it taking souls away like the bookseller did?

538
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,120
No, it's eating them.

539
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,220
It's like what Princess Iron Fan did in the past.

540
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:59,090
The Great Sage has gotten extremely famous these days.

541
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:03,220
He said he's also looking for a human that will be possessed by an evil spirit.

542
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:09,270
In any case, you should find the evil spirit I mentioned with Ma Wang.

543
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,460
But Ma Wang, are you feeling unwell?

544
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,140
No. Please leave, Sam Jang.

545
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,200
Alright.

546
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,540
Then I'll also—

547
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:40,650
Did my child also stay alive by doing that?

548
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,440
She tried to save him by feeding him human souls.

549
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,700
Seeing that there's an evil spirit wandering around doing that,

550
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,810
isn't it possible that my child is also alive and wandering about like that?

551
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,570
I'm keep telling you that's not it.

552
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,660
How could your son be an evil spirit?

553
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,990
Stop having such weird ideas.

554
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,390
- Secretary Ma, catch Sam Jang.
- What?

555
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,580
Catch and hold onto her. I have to confirm something.

556
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,180
Ah, yes.

557
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,690
Sam Jang, I apologize.

558
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,990
Hey, you wench.

559
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,290
Is this it? The place where you will call the dragon?

560
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,550
How did you find it?

561
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:35,090
It wasn't hard to find.

562
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,630
You woke up nearby here, so I took a look at the area.

563
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,010
Did you come to hurt me?

564
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,320
So you did something wrong again?

565
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,540
I'm right. What is it this time?

566
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,490
Of course. If you told me when I asked you, you wouldn't be a bad person.

567
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,620
You said you would find Ma Wang's son.

568
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,320
So did you make him up or something?

569
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,920
Oh? What is this?

570
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,070
You really made him?

571
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,850
If so, will you kill me?

572
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,820
Will you burn me?

573
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,320
No. I will protect you.

574
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,630
As you so desperately wanted, I will protect you well.

575
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:36,700
So do what you wanted to do for that human Kang Dae Seong here.

576
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,370
You knew about him?

577
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,980
Yes. Did you think I let you be because I didn't know you had gone to him?

578
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,770
Am I a fool?

579
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,500
What are you going to do about him?

580
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,770
I will befriend him, of course.

581
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:57,150
I'm going to join in while you two amicably try to summon the dragon.

582
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,350
So it was you.

583
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,070
You're the one that kept making me see strange things.

584
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,760
Leave!

585
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,590
It's an evil spirit that's been eating human souls.

586
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,430
Why are you being like this?

587
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,830
I can feel the same energy as my own in this evil spirit.

588
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,030
Wait!

589
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,050
Don't get rid of him yet. I need to check something first.

590
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,620
Ma Wang, come to your senses.

591
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,020
I told you to stop!

592
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,870
I told you to come to your senses!

593
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,700
There's no way something like that could be your son!

594
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,900
That was just a trick Ah Sa Nyeo was playing on you.

595
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,790
How can you let yourself be swayed be something like that?

596
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:26,980
She made a fool out of me.

597
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,550
- Ma Wang.
- I won't be fooled any longer. Tell me the truth.

598
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,170
What happened to my son?

599
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,890
If you don't say it, I will kill you.

600
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,020
No matter if you're a deity or not, I will kill you.

601
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,870
- You can't do this.
- Tell me!

602
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,940
Fine. Then I'll kill you.

603
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,330
You can't!

604
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,930
Secretary Ma.

605
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,640
I'm sorry.

606
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,620
Ma Wang, did she die?

607
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,990
Why did you make me so miserable like this?

608
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,140
I feel like I am going insane.

609
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,800
Ma Wang, you can't do this.

610
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,700
Why did you deceive me? Why?

611
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,470
I'm sorry! I couldn't help it.

612
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,460
I will kill you.

613
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you!

614
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,550
Your son is still alive!

615
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:15,790
Your son is still alive.

616
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:28,200
I knew it. I knew it.

617
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,560
Now you're finally telling the truth.

618
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,800
I should have done this earlier.

619
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,100
Ah, really. Really.

620
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,710
Ma Wang.

621
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,210
Secretary Ma, stand up.

622
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,750
Okay.

623
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,360
- What is this?
- So my son is alive?

624
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,420
Thanks for letting me know.

625
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:14,490
So now, tell me where he is.

626
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,730
Before, I saw Ma Wang cry.

627
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,230
It's a relief that it wasn't for real.

628
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,420
Ma Wang held back too much while trying to fulfill his duties to become a deity.

629
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,720
He should have thrown a fit sooner.

630
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,560
Earlier, that thing was sent by Ah Sa Nyeo, right?

631
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,130
Ah Sa Nyeo and Kang Dae Seong are together, right?

632
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,580
What are they doing? Why didn't you tell me?

633
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,630
Why do you continue to not call for me?

634
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:41,270
You were in danger just now. Why didn't you call for me?

635
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,910
Ma Wang was by my side.

636
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,530
Why did you tell Winter General and not me about meeting Kang Dae Seong?

637
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,060
You've been busy lately.

638
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:00,200
You're still worried that I'll get hurt because of you, since you love me.

639
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,990
How about you?

640
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,960
Why are you dealing with humans? You never used to before.

641
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,950
Are you trying to do something that I'm supposed to do by dealing with humans yourself?

642
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,420
If there's something I need to know, please tell me.

643
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:24,700
The day I threw a fit, I found out something.

644
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:30,260
When the Geumganggo disappears, my feelings will definitely disappear too.

645
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,520
And about the death bell, too, it's become very clear.

646
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,890
We have been deceived while being in love this whole time.

647
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,160
We were deceived?

648
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,590
From the beginning, we've had a deadly fate.

649
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:48,030
As predator and prey.

650
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,900
It would have been strange if it hadn't been a death bell.

651
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:59,090
The Geumganggo was just blocking this originally fatal destiny.

652
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:07,080
You're right. I didn't think of that.

653
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,060
If you want to avoid the fate of one killing the other,

654
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:15,400
you just need to avoid me when the Geumganggo disappears.

655
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:21,020
No matter how much of a bad guy I am,

656
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:27,420
I can't feed on you when I've loved you this much.

657
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,380
Then...

658
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,570
we can't see each other again?

659
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,550
That's right.

660
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:55,120
Don't worry about me possibly dying because of you from now on.

661
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,720
Your mental strength and guts always deserve a pass.

662
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,310
I was going to find you and get rid of you anyway.

663
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,000
But here you are, walking in on your own feet.

664
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,630
I guess you didn't like the evil spirit I made for you?

665
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:42,940
Did you really think you could fool me with something that shabby?

666
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:48,630
But it looks like you found out about what you wanted to know through something that shabby.

667
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:52,850
Since you came here knowing even that,

668
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:56,450
it must be because someone has your back.

669
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,410
That couldn't possibly be...

670
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,270
It's the Great Sage.

671
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,780
He said he would protect me from now on.

672
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:09,660
I guess I have to ask that thug monkey what his reasons are for that in person.

673
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:17,350
But the guy who helped you doesn't deserve to live, right?

674
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:29,960
That's right. I'm the one who played with your energy beads.

675
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:35,560
You fool. How many times are you going to be fooled?

676
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,230
Why would I count how many times I've been fooled like an idiot?

677
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,010
Whenever I see that face, I can't help but be fooled.

678
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:44,170
Because it's my younger brother.
(He uses "ahu" which means "younger brother")

679
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:49,150
That's right. Please continue to be fooled in the future too.

680
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,920
What are you going to do? Hit me? Kill me?

681
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,740
Do what you want.

682
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,490
You won't be able to use your abilities for the time being.

683
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,770
We don't know what damage you'll cause by being fooled again.

684
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:38,080
But my popularity will go down, too! Then who will collect the energy beads?

685
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,560
Without you, there are many others. Look.

686
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,420
There are many without you. Countless. Get out.

687
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,930
Don't do anything like this ever again. Time to leave.

688
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,520
Secretary Dog, it hurts!

689
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,390
Right now, my body is like a human's. I'm just a weak pig.
[Sealed]

690
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,740
Happy to hear that.

691
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,210
Anyway, Ma Wang... I'm sorry.

692
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,940
There are things you can't help but be fooled by them.

693
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,140
Will you keep looking for your son?

694
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:48,790
He's alive, but don't try to know more.

695
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:51,590
He survived through a great sin.

696
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:54,750
He shouldn't have lived.

697
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,810
If you find him and his existence becomes known,

698
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:04,370
he'll become a target of the heavens.

699
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:08,200
They'll do whatever it takes to get rid of him.

700
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:12,280
You know that very well.

701
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,340
Among everything I've heard Elder Soo Bo Ri say, that seemed the most sincere to me.

702
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:27,180
He said he's alive. So that is all that matters.

703
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:32,040
What does the Great Sage want to use Ah Sa Nyeo for?

704
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:40,200
That nutcase is probably preparing for something.

705
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,890
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

706
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:48,100
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

707
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,940
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

708
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,230
I'll have to do whatever it takes to dig up everything on Professor Kang Dae Seong.

709
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:10,490
I'm telling you, something is definitely fishy.

710
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,110
When you enter politics,

711
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,790
if your family's pro-Japanese past is revealed,

712
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,880
then it will become an obstacle.

713
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:55,990
It's my turn this time.

714
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,750
It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Kang Dae Seong.

715
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,160
You want a bite?

716
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,610
I'm fine, thank you.

717
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:13,840
You drink alcohol, right? Must be nice. I can't drink.

718
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:18,650
You don't want ice cream, and I can't drink.

719
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,160
Then what should we have together?

720
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:26,530
I will give you what I have, so do what you want.

721
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,070
You will give me what you have?

722
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,590
Why?

723
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,340
Because I picked you.

724
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,860
Me? For what reason?

725
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:50,790
Because among all the humans in here, you are the worst.

726
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:58,510
You're bad but want to climb to the very top of the world, don't you?

727
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:07,870
Become a king. I will help you become one.

728
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,190
♫ Let me out ♫

729
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:23,050
♫ Why don't you let me go ♫

730
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,750
♫ You wanna hold me down ♫

731
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:30,450
♫ Go away, go away ♫

732
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:34,330
♫ I want to get away from you ♫

733
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,870
♫ I am getting closer as though I were drawn ♫

734
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:40,530
♫ Even while I know it ♫

735
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,110
[Hwayugi]

736
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:47,690
The dragon that comes out of here is not a divine being but an evil spirit.

737
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:52,610
Is he trying to show the world how bad Kang Dae Seong is?

738
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:57,880
Then, Son Oh Gong's Geumganggo can be taken off too?

739
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:02,850
Did she catch on? About the Great Sage intending to die in her place?

740
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:05,890
Even if you don't tell me, I can still find out.

741
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,910
Seeing you like this, you're even more beautiful.
