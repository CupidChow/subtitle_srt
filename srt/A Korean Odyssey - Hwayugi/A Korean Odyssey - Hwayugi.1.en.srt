Breaking News. A forest fire broke out in the southern part of Gangwon Province around 3 p.m. yesterday,

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,210
causing extensive damage for two days.

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,740
The fire has been burning along the mountain terrain and has been known to have burned...

00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,960
On top of that the strong north wind is spreading the fire more rapidly,

She's a ghost!

Nice to meet you! Good morning!

Shall we greet each other? Please stand.

17

What is she doing?

18
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,060
I don't know. Why is she like that?

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,790
She must be crazy.

20
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,040
The only student who can hear me is you.

You are a good student!

Go.

Let's go together!

31
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,680
Let's go to the school and study with me.

32
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,170
I don't want to!

33

You are a bad student! You must be punished!

You have to be punished.

37

Go away! Go away!

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,580
Go away!

39
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,050
Ahjussi, did you drive that away?

40
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,030
- Yes.
- How?

41
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,300
Mine doesn't work.

42
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,500
That's too bad. Mine works, though.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,420
Ahjussi, you must not be human either.

44
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,920
So that you won't be scared, let's just say I'm a fairy.

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,110
I'm not scared of you, Ahjussi. I was scared of the thing before.

46
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,890
You must be seeing things that are not human.

47
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,960
I've been looking for a special human like you.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,190
You...

49
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,460
pass!

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,160
Why were you looking for me?

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,620
Because I have to ask a favor of you.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,080
If I help you, will you trade umbrellas with me?

53
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,370
Of course! Then we have a deal now, okay?

54
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,320
Sure.

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,150
If you follow this road to the forest, there will be a small house.

56
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,710
When you go in there, you just need to retrieve the item I need.

57
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,260
What is it?

58
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,260
It's a fan with the pretty name "Pachoseon."

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,950
Do you know a wildfire on the east mountain over there has been burning for a week?

60
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,610
In order to put out the fire, I need that fan.

61
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,670
If you bring it to me,

62
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,630
I will switch this umbrella with yours.

63
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,820
- Then, I will be back.
- Okay.

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,980
You're asking me to do an annoying thing.

65
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,720
Human child.

66
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,000
You have to come out right away after fetching the fan.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,130
Whatever you see, whatever you hear,

68
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,300
you must ignore it.

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,700
Okay! I do that really well.

70
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,220
- I will be back!
- Sure!

71
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,170
You can just get it. Why are you asking me?

72
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,060
That house is a strange place that is not visible to humans

73
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,130
but only humans can enter.

74
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,060
Only a special human like you can go in.

75
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Going up the stairs, inside the room at the very end, there should be a fan.

76
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,440
I was going to kill you thinking you must be a fly, but you're a human!

77
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,870
Hey kid, what are you? How did you get in here?

78
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,360
Whatever you see, whatever you hear,

79
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,930
you must ignore it.

80
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,560
You go to other people's houses with empty hands?

81
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,150
You didn't bring any gifts? Like alcohol, huh?

82
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,100
I really want to drink alcohol.

83
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,200
There's even a delicious snack right here.

84
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,760
There is no reason for a human child to see or hear me.

85
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,390
Hey, you dropped your umbrella.

86
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,430
Can you hear me?

87
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,460
So you can hear me.

88
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,790
Why did you come here?

89
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,330
Why are you taking that fan in your pocket?

90
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,850
Someone asked me a favor. A fairy man asked me to bring the fan.

91
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,440
Fairy?

92
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,480
Is he tall and has a mustache like this? He said he was a fairy?

93
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,670
- Do you know that ahjussi?
- I know him well.

94
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,550
But how did a human child like you become his henchman?

95
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,610
I'm not a henchman. We just made a deal.

96
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,750
A deal? Did you make a contract?

97
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,800
- A contract?
- You didn't?

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,690
- You're in big trouble now.
- Why?

99
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,720
You don't know what will happen to you if you just walk out right now.

100
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,460
Something really scary might attack you!

101
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,070
It won't do, it won't do.

102
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,620
Let's go together with Oppa. Oppa will protect you.

103
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,070
Since we have to go out, I will wear something fancy.

104
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,210
Before you go, put out all the candles.

105
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,020
Hurry and put them out!

106
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,170
You try it.

107
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,350
Just put them out.

108
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,790
You can't put them out. Only I can put them out.

109
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,590
Right now, you are asking me for a favor?

110
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes, human kid. I beg you. Only if you put them out can I get out.

111
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,050
- Isn't this dangerous?
- No, no, no, no, no.

112
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,230
Those five candles are the Five Elements Mountain.
(Wood, fire, earth, metal, and water)

113
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:04,060
Energy from there is holding me like this!

114
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,980
If you put them out and release me, I can protect you out there. Understand?

115
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,540
What about a contract?

116
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,420
How smart you are, even though you're little.

117
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,520
Alright. Tell me your condition.

118
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,580
Please protect me.

119
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,200
I see really scary monsters.

120
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,560
You are seeing evil spirits, right?

121
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
Living is difficult, isn't it?

122
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,590
- What's your name?
- Jin Seon Mi!

123
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,650
Jin Seon Mi.

124
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,590
I am the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

125
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,870
If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,

126
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,300
I will always appear and protect you.

127
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,560
Then, we made a contract.

128
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,580
Now, get rid of that annoying Five Elements Mountain for me.

129
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,780
Did I come out?

130
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,780
I'm out. I'm out.

131
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,450
I'm out! I'm finally out!

132
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,940
The house disappeared!

133
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,980
Yes. The prison that locked me up is completely gone!

134
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,530
Great job, Jin Seon Mi! I have to go get some alcohol first right now.

135
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,120
I want to drink with you, but you will refuse, right? Well then—

136
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,210
Where are you going? You have to stay with me and protect me from now on.

137
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,300
Ah, that's right. We made a contract.

138
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,370
First, get me to a safe place.

139
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,580
I live together with just my grandmother.

140
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,530
I will introduce you to her.

141
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,670
Wait, let me think.

142
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,970
You are not going with me?

143
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,340
Jin Seon Mi, you seem very smart.

144
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,390
You must know what prison is.

145
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,070
What kind of beings are locked up there?

146
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,200
Bad people.

147
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,470
Then what kind of person am I, who was locked up there?

148
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,540
Are you a bad person?

149
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,630
Yes. I'll introduce myself to you. I'm an extremely bad person.

150
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,800
If you are bad, you aren't going to follow the contract?

151
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,050
Although I don't like it, we can't break the contracts we make with humans.

152
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:55,930
According to our contract, when you call my name, I have to protect you.

153
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,680
Jin Seon Mi, do you remember my name?

154
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,370
Of course! Your name is—

155
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,320
Your name is... what was your name?

156
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,600
You won't remember my name because I took it out.

157
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,530
Gosh. Your memory has gone and disappeared.

158
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,270
- Bad man!
- Yes, I told you I am a bad person.

159
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,320
And there's more bad news.

160
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,320
You're going to be punished for setting this bad guy free. Most likely.

161
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,200

00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,600
How dare you try to trick me?

323
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,650
Hey! You think I can't hit you just because you're inside a child?

324
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,640
Let's not waste our strengths.

325
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,580
Stop before I beat you up.

326
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,270
Get off me! You're no priest, you monkey bastard!

327

You already know who I am, yet you won't stop spouting nonsense.

328

I guess you're not scared of getting beaten up.

329
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,250
As expected, I'll have to break the original object with your spirit in it.

330

Come over here!

331
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,700
You used to be imprisoned for the sin you committed in the heavenly world.

332

How dare you act so cocky?

333
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,860
That's why I'm gathering points doing good deeds like getting rid of evil spirits like you.

334
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,840
Stop spouting nonsense!

335
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,780
You're stressing me out.

336
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,780
Let's start by breaking everything.

337
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,330
Where could it be?

338
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,980
Where could it be?

339
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,540
Son Oh Gong! Please spare me.

340
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,120
I'll leave this kid and go somewhere else.

341
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,800
I don't want to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

342
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,320
- Son Oh Gong!
- Gosh, what now? What?

343
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,530
Great Sage, did you know that Sam Jang was born?

344
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:43,930
- What?
- I saw someone with Sam Jang's blood.

345
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:49,370
If you eat Sam Jang's flesh and drink her blood, you'll become very powerful.

346
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,170
- Is there really such a human?
- Of course!

347
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,460
I've tasted Sam Jang's flesh.

348
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,620
It smelled so delicious.

349
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,820
- You're lying to me, right?
- It's the truth.

350
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,160
I left this mark on Sam Jang's neck!

351
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,780
If you let me go, I'll help you find Sam Jang.

352
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,120
How about it, Great Sage?

353
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,180
Nice shot.

354
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,020
You mean another Father came?

355
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,210
We just got here.

356
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,720
It was him.

357
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,870
It's all done.

358

Which parish are you from?

361
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,790
I am... directly from there.

362
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,340
And as for your token of gratitude, I took it upon myself to collect it.

363
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,190
Ah, yes.

364
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,580
Oh.

365
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,830
All right then.

366
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,460
Okay. Thank you, Father!

367
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,830
But Winter General, your ice cream store has hardly any customers. What are you going to do?

368
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:55,090
Don't worry about me. Great Sage, please think about how you're going to get back to the heavenly world.

369
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,210
Since you took care of the wooden doll so well today, I guess you'll be promoted soon.

370
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,990
Probably so.

371
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,220
When I return to the heavenly world this time, the ban on drinking will also be lifted.

372
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,280
The number of bottles I saved to drink at that time is 2,982.

373
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,200
With this, it's 2,983 bottles.

374
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,220
Before you hit 3,000 bottles, I hope you return to the heavenly world and have the drinking ban lifted.

375
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,770
Of course.

376

You must've decided now not to cause any trouble in the human world and to live properly, huh?

377
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,890
Seeing you here like this...

378
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,810
Who'd suspect that you're the Winter General who caused big trouble to the whole world

379
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,920
with your freezing frost long ago?

380
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,530
I don't do stuff like that anymore.

381
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:51,560
Ah, Winter General, have you ever heard of a human being called Sam Jang?

382
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,400
Ah... the one whose blood smells of lotus flower?

383
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I did hear of her, but I've never seen any human with that smell.

384
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
Right.

385
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:08,420
I heard that a demon who drinks the blood of Sam Jang gains amazing power. Could it be true?

386
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,740
Well, if they say you become super strong with her blood, there must be a lot of them going after her to eat her up.

387
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,980
I can eat her up only if she truly exists. Would there really be someone like that?

388
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,880
Are you still staying at Ma Wang's home these days?

389

Yes, yes, yes.

Yes, 5050. It is. Why?

413
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:03,190
You always park the car like that. But this isn't good.

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,480
You caught the wooden doll. How about the bride wooden doll?

478
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,460
He had a wife?

479
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,120
He's wearing a groom outfit. They're a couple.

480
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,430
Then, I'll find her and take care of it.

481
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:10,790
This will be the last task I do in the human world. I'll have to do a clean job.

482
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,420
Actually, as for your return to the heavenly world, it hasn't been decided yet.

483
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,650
You have good performance. But when I consider the people around you for reference,

484
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,040
you have a bad reputation, Great Sage.

485
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,790
Is it the references again?

486
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,470
Who is the reference?

487
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,290
Why? Are you going to take revenge?

488
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,350
I want to be criticized specifically and be reflective wholeheartedly.

489
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:39,460
Last time, you broke two pedestrian overpasses in Ssangmun-dong while eradicating ghosts that cause car accidents, right?

490
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,720
If you cause harm to the human world like that,

491
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,050
it won't do.

492
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,350
I suffered through so much while catching those causing-car-accident ghosts. I'm speechless.

493
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,620
In any case, your reinstatement seems difficult this time because a complaint came in.

494
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,720
I knew this would happen. You deceived me again, right?

495
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,440
Hey, Great Sage. At this rate, you'll hit me.

496
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,160
I was your teacher!

497
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,070
Teacher! You shouldn't do this.

498
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,490
Since you promised me you would give me a position here, I haven't caused any trouble ever since I left Five Elements Mountain.

499
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,060
I spend my time sincerely!

500
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,920
In any case, it will be difficult for you to return this time. Next time...

501
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,720
Forget it. I won't do this anymore.

502
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,760
I won't! Ugh!

503
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,300
Are you done?

504
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,660
Keep gathering points until next time.

505
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,530
I don't need it. I'll just—

506
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,870
I'll just... have to eat Sam Jang!

507
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:02,590
How did you find out there's Sam Jang?

508
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,980
She really exists?

509
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,100
There is Sam Jang who's born into this human world?

510
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,200
There isn't any.

511
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,160
There is. You think I'm stupid?

512
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,860
You can't. If you eat up Sam Jang, you'll never be able to step foot into the heavenly world.

513
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,330
So Sam Jang really does exist.

514
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,360
I heard you become amazingly powerful if you eat that. That's true, huh?

515
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,130
- Oh Gong!
- Great!

516
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:34,860
Then I'll find Sam Jang and eat her up.

517
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,220
That monkey won't listen to me. What shall I do with him?

518
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,330
I'll have to go see Woo Ma Wang.

519
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,500
♫ What, what, what you're dreaming

520
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,260
♫ Tell me what and what, everything

521
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,660
♫ What you've been hoping for, everything, you will find it

522
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,470
♫ What, what you're dreaming

523
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:07,320
♫ Tell me, would you be able to find it again?

524
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,380
♫ Just like a never-ending story in a fairy tale

525
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,060
Are you ready for jumps?

526
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,640
♫ Catch your falling star!

527
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,240
♫ Catch your falling star!

528
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,190
♫ Catch your falling, in your eyes

529
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,120
C'mon!

530
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,420
♫ Catch your falling star! Catch your falling star!

531
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,180
♫ It's freedom! C'mon!

532
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,630
♫ Catch your falling star!

533
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,540
This is the energy from the LA concert.

534
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,090
This is from the Vancouver concert.

535
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,470
Here, the red one... The energy is better in this one.

536
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:18,180
At your agency, all the popular stars are demons, right?

537
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,040
That's a company secret.

538
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,700
What?

539
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,930
PK? Jeo Pal Gye, he told me everything.

540
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:29,610
I heard Jang Na Ra is also a demon. No wonder.

541
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,250
Without being one, there's no way she looks so young like that.

542
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,570
That's why she's considering surgery to make her look older.

543
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,800
Speaking of the Hyun Bin demon, in order to avoid being caught,

544
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,450
he went and joined the marines, right?

545
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,700
You have quite an interest in the entertainment world.

546
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,230
You collect both energy and money. You must be so happy, Ma Wang.

547
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,880
Did you come by our company to put a troublesome demon in our charge?

548
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,780
That's not it.

549
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,860
Actually, I'm here to discuss the Great Sage.

550
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:17,520
Why? Did you come here to discuss the Great Sage's promotional party or something?

551
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,850
He can't go back to the heavenly world.

552
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,950
It looks like he's about to cause some trouble.

553
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,610
Wait. To the heavenly world...

554
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,900
he can't return there?

555
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,250
Son Oh Gong... what kind of...

556
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,130
trouble is he getting himself into?

557
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,040
He says he's going to eat up Sam Jang.

558
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,660
Sam Jang? So the rumor that Sam Jang has appeared in the current times is true.

559
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:57,060
At that time, the human child who released Son Oh Gong from Five Elements Mountain...

560
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,570
You sent her, right?

561
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,300
That wasn't because I was trying to rescue Son Oh Gong.

562
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:10,650
To put out the huge bush fire on Taebaek Mountain, with good intentions, I was just trying to get only the Pachoseon.

563
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:16,380
I got 100 years deducted from 1,000 years worth of internal force as my punishment then.

564
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,590
In any case, do you remember that human child?

565
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,360
Yes.

566
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,360
- That human being is Sam Jang.
- Oh my!

567
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:33,650
As punishment for releasing a demon, she had to live with the fate of having to fight off all kinds of evil spirits.

568
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,100
Oh, is that so?

569
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:43,490
Couldn't you find that human and protect her?

570
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,870
That child... is Sam Jang?

571
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,480
You're not selling the house now?

572
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,560
You asked not long ago to put it on quick sale.

573
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,380
My child was sick, so we wanted to move. But he's all cured now.

574
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:16,370
You're all cured.

575
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:21,350
I heard I bit you, Ahjumma. I'm sorry.

576
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,240
The area where my son bit you... Is it okay?

577
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,850
Yes. I'm okay.

578
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,810
CEO, we couldn't even get our realtor's fee.

579
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:41,160
CEO, shouldn't you receive compensation for the medical bills from the kid's bite?

580
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,090
I'm fine. He's not the one who bit me.

581
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:49,390
He was some foreign man. But he's no longer in this house.

582
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,910
What foreign man? Geez.

583
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,120
That woman... She's scarier than my CEO.

584
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,770
Women are scary these days.

585
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,490
It was this house.

586
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,880
So that's what happened.

587
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,300
She's gone. Escaped.

588
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:52,250
Customer, is there something you're looking for?

589
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,760
There was something I was looking for, but it already escaped from here.

590
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,350
Pardon?

591
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,280
For giving me information, I'll have to take this one with me.

592
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,380
That's a rare item even in our store and is the most expensive item.

593
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,220
A rare item?

594
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:16,820
Sa Oh Jeong, it's me. I have to buy something right now. Pay for it.

595
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,240
All right, Hyungnim. Yes.

596
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,550
I'll send it to you right away.

597
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,220
Continue.

598
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,810
This new item reduces the curve on the display

599
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,710
to satisfy our customers' needs.

600
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,540
Here you go.

601
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,330
Thank you.

602
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,220
Have a nice day.

603
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,700
Then, I guess the woman who bought the wooden doll bride can be in danger, too.

604
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,840
We'll have to find the doll fast and get rid of it.

605
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,120
Who cares? I'm looking for that wooden doll in order to find Sam Jang.

606
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,610
I wonder if the bride would know the Sam Jang that the groom knew.

607
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,270
Then, you're not going to build up your points to get back into the heavenly world?

608
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,090
I don't need any of that, if I just eat Sam Jang up. Geez.

609
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,860
And as for this kettle, it's for the cost of the ice cream I had been eating.

610
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,860
You don't need to pay for those.

611
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,890
The reason this store is so slow is because of the cold energy you carry, Winter General.

612
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,180
The kid inside this thing... I hear she's been keeping this kettle warm for a hundred years.

613
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,250
If you leave this here, the energy in the store will become warmer.

614
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,000
You have to make money, Winter General. I'm leaving.

615
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,720
Thank you, Hyungnim!

616
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,330
I'm cold, you're warm. We're polar opposites, but...

617
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,320
Let's not fight and get along well.

618
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,620
Nice to meet you.

619
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,260
We have to get on the Olympic Highway but there's too much traffic on the Olympic Highway.

620
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,640
I wonder if there's been an accident.

621
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,350
CEO, should we go to that bath house building in Uijeongbu tomorrow?

622
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,920
That scared me!

623
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,900
Over there, again!

624
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,060
I'm sorry. I'll just go.

625
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,960
I wasn't talking to you, Han Joo. Drive.

626
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,590
Okay.

627
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,620
If left alone, there will be an accident.

628
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:49,510
Han Joo, speed up to the car in front of us and pull up right next to the driver's seat.

629
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,560
Why?

630
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,520
I want to curse him out.

631
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,290
Han Joo, hurry.

632
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,830
Pull your window down! Your window!

633
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,760
Your window! Ugh, seriously!

634
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,050
Pull your window down! Your window!

635
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,880
You, SOB! Wake up and come to your senses!

636
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,590
Who the heck is that woman? That crazy...

637
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,180
Open your eyes, you bastard.

638
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,440
You f***ing a**hole!

639
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,360
You want to freeze to death in f***ing Siberia?

640
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,160
Pull over!

641
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,700
Hey, geez...

642
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,360
Go away! Go away! Get lost!

643
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,830
What are you looking at? I'm here!

644
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,390
Hey, pull over!

645
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,960
You SOB!

646
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,120
What the heck? Pull over!

647
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,490
- Hey, pull over! Pull over!
- It flew away.

648
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,800
Hey, pull over! Hey!

649
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,730
CEO, what's the matter?

650
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,740
I'll follow you to the end!

651
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,650
He looks really scary.

652
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:14,580
We might get hit. Step on it.

653
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,190
I don't know how to fight. Geez.

654
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,540
Good thing I'm a good worker and a good driver, too.

655
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,760
We almost got into huge trouble today. Seriously.

656
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:47,150
CEO, looking at this map, there's tons of traffic.

657
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,810
Can we go to Uijeongbu tomorrow?

658
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:54,740
No, we should go today. Got it? Today.

659
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,990
Let's see.

660
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,250
♫ When I saw you ♫

661
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,830
♫ I think only about you ♫

662
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,650
♫ When I love you ♫

663
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,540
♫ Did you miss me ♫

664
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,470
♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

665
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,330
♫ I will ♫

666
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:43,620
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

667
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,900
♫ Can we go back ♫

668
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,040
♫ When I saw you ♫

669
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,640
♫ Always behind of you ♫

670
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,260
Then, we made a contract.

671
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,450
If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,

672
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:14,480
I will always appear and protect you.

673
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,600
♫ Close your eyes ♫

674
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,080
♫ Just seeing the back of my head leaving ♫

675
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,960
♫ When I leave you ♫

676
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,820
♫ Are you with me ♫

677
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,760
Anyway, bye.

678
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,600
♫ Even if the world hates us ♫

679
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,590
♫ I will ♫

680
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,380
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

681
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,560
He got caught. He's caught.

682
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,210
CEO, there's no traffic if we take the Seoul Ring Expressway.

683
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,320
CEO! I said there's no traffic!

684
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,360
♫ Always behind of you ♫

685
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,690
♫ Always behind of you ♫

686
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:14,350
Wow, kiddo. You aged a lot.

687
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:17,190
You survived. I'm proud of you.

688
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:22,720
I aged a lot trying to survive. But you're still the same, Fairy.

689
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,920
By chance, were you still looking for me?

690
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,720
You finally appear now, Fairy?

691
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,450
I didn't just appear now. I guess I was passing by?

692
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,940
As expected. I wondered why you showed up again after you conned me.

693
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,210
I didn't have a chance to appear. You've never called my name, have you?

694
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,990
If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,

695
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:51,200
I will always appear and protect you.

696
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,730
Jin Seon Mi, do you remember my name?

697
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,640
You won't remember my name because I took it out.

698
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,960
What was his name?

699
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,110
Why didn't you look for it diligently?

700
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:13,080
Even though I'm sure you wouldn't have remembered it no matter how much you tried.

701
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,860
Fortunately, I didn't look for it diligently.

702
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,540
You didn't seem very worthy, so I stopped looking for you.

703
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,300
- What?
- When I was a child and didn't know any better,

704
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,320
I thought you were a big thing since you lied and said you were a fairy.

705
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,750
But as I lived on, I learned that you could be a Jibang spirit (an ordinary spirit trapped in a house) like how you used to be.

706
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:38,230
By chance, is your name Jibang Spirit?

707
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:42,190
Are you calling me a Jibang spirit and an ordinary spirit?

708
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,650
Are you not? Forget it then.

709
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,200
Ah, you said you were passing by, right?

710
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,170
I wasn't going to stop you by calling out your name, so pass on by.

711
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,010
What's wrong, huh?

712
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,630
I heard human beings only gain anger as they age.

713
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:02,410
The child Jin Seon Mi who begged me to protect her was cute at least.

714
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:07,640
Old Jin Seon Mi who nags furiously at me looks pathetic.

715
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,690
It must have been hard for you to deal with even an ordinary spirit.

716
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,790
Ugh, I can't just pass you by.

717
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,210
What's your cell phone number? I'll text you a talisman.

718
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,900
Are you getting my number? Wow. Then, will you tell me your name?

719
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,710
If I told you my name is so and so, would that be my real name?

720
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:32,710
Then... If I were to call out your real name, will you show up to protect me?

721
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:35,400
That's right. Call me if you're struggling. I can't guarantee that I'll answer.

722
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,990
Why would I call you? You said you'd come if I called out your name.

723
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,580
- What?
- I know your real name, Fairy. I remember.

724
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,580
I already know what your name is.

725
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,740
All right then. I'll get going first since I'm busy.

726
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:09,360
Hey, old Jin Seon Mi? How can you tell such a lie? How would you know my name?

727
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,670
I just remembered it.

728
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,560
It's not something you can just remember.

729
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,900
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

730
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:20,440
How dare you try to deceive me?

731
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,120
If you really know, try calling it. You don't, right?

732
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,060
You don't know, right?

733
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,680
You got scared. That I might call out your name, huh?

734
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,430
Hey! Do you know what I am?

735
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:38,750
With the blank blank blank characters in my name, even the Jade Emperor trembles. That's the kind of person I am!

736
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,930
So you shouldn't be lying to me. Just say you don't know.

737
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,020
I'll say I don't know.

738
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,530
Ugh, seriously! If you don't know, you don't know. What do you mean "I'll say I don't know"?

739
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:53,190
I won't be calling you anyway, so let's say I don't know.

740
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:58,500
- What?
- I won't be calling you in the future. It's not that I can't.

741
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,710
I aged pretty well.

742
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:07,130
I got to know things on my own and lived a good life protecting myself.

743
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:11,470
While doing that, I didn't have the need to call on you to protect me.

744
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,710
You don't need me.

745
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,520
I guess it was worth aging for you. Fine.

746
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:25,340
I'll go on my way. You go ahead and keep aging without stopping.

747
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:30,980
I will give you good advice. Age slowly.

748
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:37,640
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

749
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,470
♫ Can we go back ♫

750
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:43,170
Fairy, please don't go!

751
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,320
Whenever you call my name, I will come and protect you.

752
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,240
Of course, you will never be able to call my name.

753
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,140
Anyway, bye!

754
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,230
♫ Always behind of you ♫

755
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,520
♫ Always behind of you ♫

756
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,010
- Excuse me.
- Yes, welcome.

757
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:23,760
By chance, is CEO Jin Seon Mi here?

758
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,440
You're him, right? "You passed!"

759
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,800
Wow... you're so cool!

760
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,520
Is she here? CEO Jin Seon Mi.

761
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,070
Our CEO? On her way to Uijeongbu to check out some property to buy,

762
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,190
she ran into so much traffic, so she went to look somewhere else.

763
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:48,540
She'll be right back. Wait just a moment.

764
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,720
Wow, you have such a small face.

765
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,480
Right?

766
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,630
- Would you like some coffee?
- Sure.

767
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,140
This is the CEO's office. Please wait here for a moment.

768
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,520
I'll go get some right now. Gourmet quality.

769
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,360
Thank you.

770
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,460
Man, why all the fuss?

771
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:26,100
Wow, it's a big deal. Epic. Someone I'm a fan of came to the real estate agency.

772
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,490
I'll give you a hint. "You passed!"

773
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:34,710
Yeah, right, right! His face is so small! Daebak! Totally cool!

774
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,410
We have a deal now, okay?

775
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,090
Sure.

776
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,170
It is that child.

777
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,100
Realtor's License

778
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,110
She became the CEO of a real estate agency.

779
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:19,340
Even though she's Sam Jang, she's living so ordinarily.

780
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,800
Wow, look at this.

781
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:39,900
She made tons of money with Sam Jang's ability. How many gold nuggets are there?

782
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:48,810
I did hear that this building is hers.

783
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,700
The subway station was close by, too.

784
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,300
It must be worth quite a bit.

785
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,270
If she made so much money, she should buy nice slippers.

786
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,330
What the heck is this? She's not a beggar.

787
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:20,550
Is this Sam Jang's scent?

788
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:26,400
I heard Sam Jang smells of lotus flower.

789
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:33,000
Is it just a dirty smell?

790
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,830
No, is it the fragrance of a lotus flower?

791
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:39,790
Ah, is it... ugh...

792
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,940
Ah, lotus flower... is it not?

793
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:52,730
Lotus flower... I heard it's good.

794
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,370
Is it lotus flower?

795
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,770
How disgraceful.

796
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,700
That's right! This is it!

797
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,790
I'm ecstatic!

798
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:21,500
This lotus flower scent!

799
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,990
I'll make the smell stay all over my body! All over!

800
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:32,880
I want to stick it on my nose! Tape! Tape!

801
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,220
I'll come back next time.

802
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,680
Let's say I drank it already.

803
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,060
What a wacko.

804
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,940
Ugh, so embarrassing!

Did you meet Sam Jang?

808
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:22,020
No, I couldn't. I humiliated myself in front of the office worker.

809
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:28,240
In any case, I'm sure that employee recognized my face. What if he posts online?

810
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,580
- Should I kill him?
- Yeah, kill him. Never mind.

811
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,140
We know now where Sam Jang is.

812

I got you. You're that girl, right? That crazy b**** who cussed at me earlier.

I finally found you. I caught you!

Hey, you be careful! If we meet again, you're dead!

819

What?

820
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:57,410
Since you told me you wouldn't need me, I thought you were good at fighting but you still have only an umbrella.

821
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:02,240
My cell phone here and the CCTV over there. Things like these protect me well.

Fine.

823
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,780
Even though it's impossible, let's just say you remembered my name.

824
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,300
Then, why didn't you call for me?

825
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:15,310
Who's the one who ran away? You're getting upset at me for not calling for you?

826
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:19,560
After hearing I wasn't needed, I felt offended. As if you were looking down on me.

827
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,190
I'll have to check. Hurry up and call me. What's my name?

828
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:26,970
Fine. I'll call your name. Fairy, your name is...

829
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,490
Your name is...

830
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:48,810
Yes, Han Joo. I'm sorry I couldn't answer your call.

831
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,100
I recognized someone on my way in.

832
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,530
Hurry up and hang up. Can't you see the person whom you were having a conversation with?

833
01:12:54,530 --> 01:13:00,230
He's not an important person. Yes, I'll be there soon.

834
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:08,740
This "not important" person has been waiting for long time while being offended. What kind of trick are you trying to play?

835
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:12,390
A trick to keep you on your toes.

836
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,200
I'm sure you felt at ease thinking I couldn't call on you.

837
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,840
From now on, stay alert knowing you'll never know when I'm going to call on you.

838
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,930
Then, call me.

839
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,300
I'll kill you if you're wrong.

840
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:36,260
Since you called me "Fairy," I was going to end it at being a cute fairy tale.

841
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,620
But you're going too far with your joke.

842
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:51,250
Should this Fairy end the fairy tale cruelly with some blood?

843
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:59,470
Fine. I don't know your name. I was being pretentious.

844
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,690
I was still proud of you for remembering me. So I said hi. How dare you be pretentious with me?

845
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:10,780
Have you ever thought of me who might call on you?

846
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,970
Of course not. I knew you'd never be able to call me.

847
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,630
I see.

848
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:26,990
I've been waiting for that fairy for the past 25 years.

849
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,280
Wondering if he'd come to protect me.

850
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:36,050
Desperately.

851
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,600
The happy ending in the fairytales with fairies...

852
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,990
The torture of hope that lasted 25 years ends today.

853
01:14:52,050 --> 01:14:56,590
I came out saying I'm not a fairy a long time ago.

854
01:14:56,590 --> 01:15:04,770
I know. But I don't know why I waited for you.

855
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:30,570
I heard you gave this kettle to Oppa as a gift.

856
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:35,290
Since she's warm and cute, I think she'll get along just fine with me.

857
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,870
I want to have a drink rather than ice cream today.

858
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:46,460
Great Sage, you're not allowed to drink for escaping Five Elements Mountain.

859

On a day like today, I can drink 12 jars of alcohol.

860
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,120
Did something happen today that caused you to crave a drink?

861
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,970
A kiddo I knew a long time ago showed up looking much older.

862
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:59,380
She made me feel uneasy.

863
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:03,160
- You must've done something wrong to that kiddo.
- Yeah.

864
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,900
But I don't feel uneasy about the wrong thing I did at all.

865
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,650
But she said she waited for me for 25 years.

866
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,250
Desperately?

867
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:15,050
I don't know what that is, but it concerns me very much.

868
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,840
Desperately means something like this.

869
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:31,080
For 25 years, because it was never allowed, you weren't able to forget about it,

870

and you end up wanting it even more.

871

I'm sorry.
