[Chairman Woo Hwi of Lucifer Entertainment 1930s Record Film Donation]

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,340
Yes.

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,080
Oh, thank you.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,910
Thank you.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,040
The 1930's record film you donated will become a priceless legacy.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,430
You did something great.

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,000
It was no big deal.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,100
It was a big deal.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,270
In order to retrieve that film from Heidelberg University in Germany,

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,800
he traveled five times and donated one million dollars.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,390
When you display the film, we ask that you please place a write-up of all his efforts with it.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,890
- What do you mean?
- A great deed must be known.

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,430
When we host the film screening, we plan on extensively announcing all your achievements.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,720
Aigoo, there is no need to do that...

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,290
Also, from the Ministry of Culture,

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,380
I heard that you will be receiving the presidential medal

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,000
for the cultural artist award.

22
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,130
The presidential medal?

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,580
Oh, well they didn't have to do such ...

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,590
This kind of good deed is another way for me to become a deity.

25
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,670
There is nothing to be impressed about receiving an award from a human,

26
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,130
but it feels good to show off, so it's not so bad.

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,470
I will spread around the article extensively so that there will be many opportunities for you to boast freely.

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,510
They said the medal ceremony will be televised live, right?

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,900
I better get a new outfit made. I have nothing to wear next week.

30

Excuse me. We will pass by.

There are interesting things at a museum.

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,400
Among the old items, there are ones which the owners’ souls are attached to.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,130
Be careful! This sword belonged to a general who saved this nation.

34
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,690
It seems like the owner of that sword is a remarkable person.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,140
The one who saved the country. It's her.

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,240
The one who used that sword to save the nation is that woman,

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,310
but it seems people are mistaken about the general.

38
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,220
If they find out it's an unknown woman's sword instead of an honorable general's sword,

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,860
they wouldn't cherish it that way.

Among the preciously displayed objects in this place

41

Some could hold hideous secrets perhaps.

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,580
Is this the motel where strange things happen?

45
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,910
Yes. There's been many strange rumors, so customers have stopped coming.

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,360
The owner got scared and wants to sell it as fast as possible, so he’s asking for half the market value.

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,300
Let's go in.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,460
Whoa, the bathtub is extremely big.

49
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,690
What do you mean by strange rumors?

50
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,930
Well, first of all, this is a motel, you know?

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,510
So what it is is the kind of bling-bling, you know?

52
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,130
So when couples are in the midst of their love-love business,

53
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,530
they say something strange just pops out all of sudden and ruins it all.

54
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,080
It doesn't make sense, right? They should go to the hospital or eat some eel instead (believed to be an aphrodisiac).

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
They're only making excuses because they're lacking, seriously.

It seems like there isn't anything especially odd.

There is something. Who is that?

58

Wow, this is great! I like it.

59

62
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,910
- The one who told me to get lost.
- Look at this style.

63
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't worry about him. He's someone who protects me ... kind of.

Well, it's something like that.

CEO, but just because you're not popular yet,

73
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,450
I think they assigned you a person who's lacking something, too. He's a bit...

74
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,250
- Weird, right?
- Yes.

75
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,820
But he can hear even if we whisper, so we can't badmouth him.

76
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,030
If we badmouth him, we'll be in trouble.

Okay.

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,790
Oh, you're here? Alright, just a minute.

79
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,060
The building owner came with the key to the rooftop. I'll go get it.

80
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,280
Seriously.

81
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,590
Son Oh Gong, there seems to be an evil spirit in here, right?

82
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,110
I'm not sure. But this room is really great.

83
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,610
The bed's big. The bathtub's big. I want to live in a room like this.

84
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,290
- This isn't a room you can live in.
- I can't live here?

85
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,770
Then, what do you do here?

86
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,820
That's enough. Knock it off with the embarrassing talk and find the evil spirit already.

87
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,710
Why? What's wrong? This room has a way bigger TV than your house.

88
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,950
Do you want to watch a movie with me tonight?

Oh! Wow, they even deliver chicken. I really like chicken!
[Fried Chicken]

So a place like this existed in this world. I should sleep here before I go.

91
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,180
- What?
- Who do you think you're trying to fool with the innocent act?

92
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,050
Aren't you embarrassed of lying while looking at me straight in the face?

93
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,510
I am embarrassed. You think I wouldn't be?

94
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,720
But what can I do? Since I love you.

95
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,520
That's what love is like. So what if I get a little embarrassed?

96
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,010
When today, I could even sleep with you here.

97
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm embarrassed of your love talk.

98
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,070
Right... I should make love.

99
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,580
What's happening?

100
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,100
What are you doing? Making my heart flutter...

101
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,470
You heard earlier. We have to "love-love" for the evil spirit to appear.

102
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh, "love-love."

103
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,700
That's a good idea, but I don't think this is enough to make it appear.

104
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,560
- When it appears, you catch it right away.
- Okay.

105
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,720
But, you know, if it still doesn't appear, what should we do?

106
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,770
Well, in that case...

107
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,750
U-um, in that case...

108
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,900
Then...

109
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,670
Hold on.

110
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,690
Why, you! No manners whatsoever!

111
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,120
That thing!

112
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,340
- You caught it?
- Yeah. But I don't think there's just one.

113
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,680
Let's hurry and keep going.

Agh, that damned evil spirit. Seriously...

116
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,730
But why was that evil spirit attracted to this place?

117
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,260
Huh?
[Fried Chicken]

118
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,330
It was attracted to a truly filthy wickedness that exists here.

119
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,080
A filthy desire to watch people in secret and the obscene greed to make money off of it.

120
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,590
There was something like this in the room.

121
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,560
This must be something a person set up, right?

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,520
Of course.

123
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,450
CEO.

124

The owner says he's available to sign a contract right away.

125
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,230
Hello. Who will I be signing a contract with...

126
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,400
Ah, damn it...

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,160
- Catch that person!
- Pardon?

128
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,690
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Why, why, why?!

129
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,360
Sir! Sir!

130
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,830
Oh my god! Oh my god!

131
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,070
Are you all right?

132
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,900
Turns out we caught both an evil spirit and an evil person today.

133
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,750
If we keep digging up one after another like this, we should be able to prevent the terrible events I see.

134
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't you think so too, Son Oh Gong?

135
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,350
Whether this world breaks apart or blows up, it has nothing to do with me.

136
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,320
I just need to protect you because I love you.

137
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm thankful.

138
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,070
But still, this world I love shouldn't get destroyed.

139
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,880
What you love isn't important.

140
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,790
The only thing that's important is that I love you.

141
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,690
That's right. No matter how I feel, the only person in love is you.

142
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,560
I'm going to go home, so you can leave.

143
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,420
Let's go together. I like going with you.

144
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,300
Because you love me?

145
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,160
Then I guess there's nothing I can do.

146
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,390
What do you mean? Why?

147
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,820
The air's nice for once, and the band I like released a new song.

148
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
I wanted to go for a walk by myself while listening to it.

149
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,970
When going for a walk in a good mood while listening to good music and breathing in good air,

150
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,220
me being next to you should make it even better, no?

151
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,090
I guess it's not.

152
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,480
The only person in love is you. I'm not in love.

153
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,990
But you know I'm not in love because I want to be.

154
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,850
Okay, I get it. Come with me then.

155
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,900
- Go by yourself.
- You can come with me.

156
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,060
Never mind, go.

157
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,120
Hurry and go!

158
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,500
Okay.

159
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,460
I'll be done, and you'll be alone again.

160
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,920
I have to come to my senses.

161
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,720
Is this it?

162
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,730
What the...

163
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,570
What is this?

164
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,940
Do you want to know who I am?

165
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,950
You're a Japanese kid? How did you get in? Who are you?!

166
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,540
Nobody must know who I am.

167
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,190
Don't come near me. Stay away!

168
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,420
What the...

169
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,130
Damn it!

170
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,350
Who was that kid earlier?

171
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,710
She's not coming, right?

172
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,900
The news about you receiving the presidential medal made the main page of the web portal.

173
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,690
Ah, is that so? Let's see...

174
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,250
They should've used a good picture of me...
[Lucifer Entertainment Chairman Woo Hwi Receives Presidential Medal]

175
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,890
Should I post in the group chat that you'll be receiving the medal?

176
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:49,510
When it's on the front page of the site like this, I'm sure everyone's seen it. It's fine.

177
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,170
You worked hard.

178
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,190
Oh, Chairman.

179
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,960
These packages just arrived. Why don't you take them with you?

180
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Ah, yes, of course.

181
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,120
Huh? These are Jin Bu Ja's again.

182
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,640
That girl is in a home shopping craze these days. What's with all these?

183
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,120
It's another day that you have a lot of outside visitors.

184
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,670
Any visitor who parks

185
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,660
needs to get a parking sticker first. Please be aware from now on.

186
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,670
Yes, I understand. But it seems like there are a lot of visitors today?

187
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,640
Yes, as you can see.

188
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,950
By the way, I saw the article about you.

189
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,180
You mean the presidential medal?

190
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,400
That's why all your acquaintances must have come to hold a party to congratulate you.

191
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,280
Just what is so great about a presidential medal? They are making such a fuss!

192
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,060
Aigoo, congratulations!

193
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,270
♫ Always by your side...

194
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,780
These darn people are really— The presidential medal...

195
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,640
The presidential medal.

196
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,370
It seems like everyone came.

197
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,700
Ma Wang!

198
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,900
- Ma Wang.
- So you have been waiting for me?

199
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,630
Those are mine, right?

200
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh, you were waiting for the packages.

201
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,240
But... it doesn't look like anything much is prepared.

202
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,410
It's not like this is a distribution center. Hey, Bu Ja.

203
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,250
I told you to take off the address labels on the packages

204
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,420
and flatten them up for recycling instead of piling them up like this, didn't I?

205
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,340
Yeah.

206
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,180
So you've arrived, Ma Wang.

207
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,630
Oh! You're here too are you, Pal Gye?

208
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,740
Oh this, what is it?

209
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,810
- Why are you here?
- You know I come here just to eat and play a lot these days.

210
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,990
Playing and eating all day, are you some kind of a pig?

211
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,680
Oh yeah, you are a pig.

212
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,750
Jeo Pal Gye, are you a pig?

213
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,310
I'm not an ordinary pig.

214
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,670
Oh, this? Oh, it's this!

215
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,750
This is it, right? The perfume to cover up the smell of decay, right?

216
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,910
Ah, that's the perfume that got the presidential medal for getting rid of the rotting smell!

217
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,730
Son Oh Gong recommended this to me.

218
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,690
It's lotus flower fragrance.

219
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,600
Good. Good. Spray it all over yourself.

220
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,750
- Internet, Internet, huh? Internet. The main page of the website.
- This is a candle?

221
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,790
So you've arrived, Ma Wang?

222
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,630
What is all this?

223
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,070
Hyungnim Oh Gong said that he's lost his appetite these days,

224
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,350
so I made him some side dishes.

225
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,550
I read on the news today that you have a tour

226
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,390
scheduled for Europe with the VIP of the Blue House starting tomorrow, no?

227
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,710
Yeah, that's why I was going to make a few different types of side dishes before leaving.

228
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,730
There's not a single one of the dishes I like.

229
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,570
If you tell me what you like, I'll make it for you.

230
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,100
It's alright.

231
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,500
Okay, then I won't make it.

232
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,990
Damn it. Nobody knew.

233
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,810
No wonder. I thought my cosmetics kept running low.

234
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,020
So you've been using them, huh?

235
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,070
Let me remind you again. The house is under joint ownership, not everything in the house.

236
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,570
Don't use my stuff and don't hang your clothes on my bull horn.

237
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,100
Also, when visitors come, tell the security office beforehand and get a parking sticker.

238
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,830
And tell Bu Ja to stop having packages delivered.

239
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,460
If you've brought a kid in, you should take her out for walks or something.

240
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,460
You keep shoving her in the fridge, so she keeps watching home shopping all day!

241
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,880
Look! You use my cosmetics and you don't even close the caps!

242
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,450
You thug.

243
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,900
Anyway, congrats, Ma Wang. I heard you're getting an award.

244
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,940
- You knew?
- Yeah.

245
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,560
I heard it's some first place prize. How amazing. That's Ma Wang.

246
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,100
This.

247
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,870
You use it by squeezing it out like this.

248
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,910
And you should use this as the step before. It's very effective.

249
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,600
If you're going to use it, use it directly.

250
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,570
Come here.

251
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,270
Around the eyes, gently, gently. There.

252
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,380
Ma Wang, I feel really crappy.

253
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,610
Even after taking a bath for three hours, I still don't feel any better.

254
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,970
Do you have low blood pressure? If you're low on sugar, it can happen.

255
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,740
Eat some sweets and go to bed.

256
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,720
Ma Wang. Sam Jang says she doesn't like me.

257
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,690
You already knew that.

258
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,440
You're in a one-sided love.

259
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,520
I never realized that her not liking me would be this painful.

260
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Her pain is your pain. When she's hurting, you'll hurt too.

261
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,630
However, your pain isn't her pain.

262
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,630
Even if you collapse from pain, she'll feel nothing.

263
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,110
Only I am hurting, and she is not.

264
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,970
It feels like I'm always losing. This is the worst.

265
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,230
If you don't want to be in pain, then all you have to do is not love her,

266
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,700
but that's not a possibility for you now is it, Great Sage?

267
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,180
It's not like you can share the pain.

268
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,000
You're going to get dark circles.

269
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,100
Here, here. Put this on your face before you sleep.

270
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,460
I was taking a walk but didn't want to walk home alone.

271
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,710
So I came to have a drink. Is that alright for you?

272
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,040
There are nights when we don't want to be alone.

273
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,640
But why did you come alone? You should have called Son Oh Gong.

274
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,780
He doesn't like being called when he can't even drink.

275
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,400
Even if he doesn't like it, he will come whenever you call him.

276
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,070
But I don't like that anyway. It's not like he is coming on his own free will.

277
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,570
He has no choice but to come because of the Geumganggo.

278
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,410
You must be sad that it's not genuine.

279
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,760
Pardon? What's there to be sad about?

280
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,100
His feelings are all fake after all.

281
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,590
I'm a fool to take them seriously.

282
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,510
But even so, you shouldn't ignore them.

283
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:53,580
No matter what, right now he is in love with you and can get hurt easily.

284
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,440
The hurt he feels is real.

285
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,880
Last night, Sam Jang came to my sister's bar alone.

286
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,060
She went there alone?

287
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,900
Apparently, now that the two of them have gotten close, she's going to visit often when she wants to drink by herself.

288
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,800
Really? I guess I will stop by there every night then.

289
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,050
What's with them?

290
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,380
They're fans waiting for Jeo Pal Gye.

291
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,200
They hear rumors from time to time that he'll be coming here and wait like that all night for him.

292
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,550
How pitiful. Why in the world would they do something like that?

293
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,630
Because they love him. They chase after him like that to express their love.

294
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,520
Even though Jeo Pal Gye doesn't like them doing that.

295
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,100
Why wouldn't he like it when they're only following him around because they love him?

296
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,910
It's burdensome when people get so attached like that.

297
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,870
They've been there for hours putting in the effort just to give Pal Gye their gifts.

298
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,520
It's a bit pitiful.

299
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,830
You said you were taking this as a gift for Sam Jang, right?

300
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,790
Forget it. I'm not going to put in that kind of effort. I'm not pitiful like that!

301
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,140
Why should I take something like this to her?

302
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,960
Because you love her. Don't you?

303
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,970
General Winter, do I look the same as those girls to you?

304
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,070
Waiting even though no one said to come and giving gifts even though they weren't asked for.

305
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,130
Whenever you're about to lie you freeze up.

306
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,170
Am I really in the same boat with them?

307
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:37,070
As the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, shouldn't I be a bit different?

308
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:44,000
He's here! He's here! Omo! Pal Gye Oppa! I love you, Oppa!

309
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,840

I caught this incredibly heinous criminal. Me!

You did something really great, Lee Han Joo.

You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

323
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,830
Of course not. How could a man get injured over something like that?

324
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,650
Maybe it was because of this strong sense of justice telling me "You've gotta catch that guy,"

325

but in that moment my body just went whoosh flying through the air on it's own.

So that's why you don't like me but value Lee Han Joo?

That's right. At the very least, Lee Han Joo knows that I don't like peanut flavored ice cream.

You're fine with just blindly loving me as you've been doing.

Then if I want to care about what you like, will you tell me?

This is an area where we display artifacts that have been donated by Korea Foundation.

465
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,750
Is that so?

466
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,550
The foundation director's household is that of a highly reputable and esteemed independence activist.

467
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:00,230
They're very meaningful items, so we can't move them to another location.

468
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,010
If that's so, I understand.

469
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,860
Yes, Chairman.

470
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,430
Just a minute.

471
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,020
Yes.

472
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:22,540
Director, you know about the rumors going around on the internet about Korea Foundation, right? About an intrusion?

473
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,300
- It's a conspiracy.
- A security officer wrote that he saw a ghost after trying to open it.

474
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,290
Don't speak such nonsense. There's nothing wrong with our museum's items.

475
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,110
Go and prepare for the film screening event!

476
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,530
Yes, sir.

477
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,660
There's a rumor that he saw a ghost.

478
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,180
Do you wish to know who I am?

479
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,650
You! You!

480
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,390
You know who I am.

481
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,130
I have to get rid of people who know me.

482
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,540
Stop.

483
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,990
Little girl.

484
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,000
Is it a ghost lingering around an antique?

485
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,830
I hear that's an item from the home of a highly esteemed independence activist.

486
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:04,470
Yet why did a Japanese girl come out of there?

487
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,450
Little girl.

488
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,940
She ran away into there!

489
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,860
This is bothersome.

490
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,010
What?

491
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,300
A Japanese girl wearing a red kimono went into this film?

492
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,670
Yes.

493
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,920
Tomorrow is the film screening.

494
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,500
After having invited all those humans for the screening, while the film is showing,

495
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,520
What if that girl comes out?

496
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,590
I'm sorry.

497
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:19,010
I guess I'll have to go into the film and get that little girl. What did you say she looked like?

498
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,940
I made a drawing of her.

499
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,050
This looks as if it was drawn with a dog's paws.

500
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,000
- Oh, right. They actually are dog's paws.
- I apologize.

501
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,310
I would need Sam Jang in order to lure her and catch her.

502
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,570
Call Sam Jang.

503
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,830
- Is this your favorite movie?
- Yes.

504
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,980
But I've never seen it at the movie theater.

505
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,810
It's been re-released, but tonight's the last showing.

506
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,800
I'm really glad I'm going to get to watch it.

507
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,780
There's a lot of time left. Want to watch another movie while we wait?

508
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,870
Is there a movie you want to watch?

509
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,920
Let's see...

510
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,060
This one looks great.

511
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,260
It must be a movie with a warm storyline. It has little clothing.
[Scarlet Innocence
Blind by passion then his eyes open in obsession]

512
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,610
I like movies with warm stories.

513
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,650
Do you think they're wearing little clothes because it has a warm storyline?

514
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,690
They're probably wearing little because it's has a warm storyline.

515
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,390
I was born from a volcano, so I like warm atmospheres like this, you see.

516
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,890
I'm feeling hot because of all of this anger you cause.

517
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,180
It's warm and nice.

518
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,460
What a nuisance. Why is he calling again?

519
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,670
[Lucifer Entertainment]

520
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,930
Why are you calling us for this? It's simple. Just burn it.

521
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,990
I already told you. I need this film for the screening event tomorrow.

522
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,770
But you can't play it in front of so many people.

523
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,570
No matter how I think of it, I think it's best to cancel the screening and burn it.

524
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,460
That's not possible.

525
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,860
This film is the deciding factor for Ma Wang to receive his presidential medal.

526
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,720
- Without this, they won't give you the medal?
- I'm sure they would give it.

527
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,670
But if I go to receive the award after burning the film I donated,

528
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,900
wouldn't that be disgraceful?

529
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,850
They'll badmouth him for reaping the rewards and then ditching.

530
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,210
Or they might spread gossip that this was planned from the start just so he could get the award.

531
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:27,020
After being so happy that you're getting the award, it looks like you're going to get a ton of criticism.

532
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,370
You'll pass through being cursed. It's the ultimate pass.

533
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:35,430
That's why I'm saying we need to go in the film and get the kid out before the film screening.

534
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,610
I think you will need to go in, Sam Jang.

535
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,990
Okay.

536
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,770
Damn, we have to go watch a movie, but it looks like we're going to be watching this out-dated film instead.

537
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,860
You stay out here.

538
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm not taking Son Oh Gong with me.

539
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,210
Last time when we went into the portrait,

540
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,650
you locked up our Oh Gong in there.

541
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,160
You might do that again, so Ma Wang should come with me this time.

542
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,210
That's right. Our Oh Gong will not go in. Ma Wang go in.

543
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,190
Come out within an hour.

544
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:18,780
Then you'll be able to watch the movie you like. I'll wait.

545
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,390
Well... all right.

546
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,220
What? Hurry and get ready.

547
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,100
Oh, look at that quality. I'm already bored.

548
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,240
Oh, there they are.

549
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,100
They made it inside well I see.

550
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,730
The film is an hour long. They'll need to find her and come out before it's over.

551
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,890
She will come out before then.

552
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,710
You see, our Sam Jang has to go watch a movie with me.

553
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,790
Good.

554
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,410
We're inside the film's recorded length of an hour.

555
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,540
If you mess anything up, it'll ruin the invaluable filmstrip

556
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,800
so please be careful.

[Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae]

558
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,670
So there were movies at this time as well?

559
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,840
Ah, it's Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae.

560
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,380
During this time, they were silent films, but the silent-film narrators were spectacular.

561
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:20,370
"Therefore, Lee Soo Il and Sim Soon Ae crossed the line they shouldn't have."

562
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,520
What do you think? Do you want to stop by the theater real quick?

563
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,390
There is no time. We must hurry.

564
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,450
You must be in a hurry because of the movie you're supposed to watch out there.

565
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,270
Since it's a movie I like.

566
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,530
What did you say the little girl looks like?

567
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,160
A little girl wearing a red kimono about this tall.

568
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,930
It probably won't be of much help, but...

569
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,720
This is a sketch Secretary Ma made.

570
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,030
We'll be able to find her with this then.

571
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,810
How can you recognize her with a picture drawn with a dog's paw?

572
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:03,810
The defining features are very clear. A flower printed kimono, a short bob haircut,

573
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:08,850
A round face, big eyes, and a mole here.

574
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,630
You're really quite amazing.

575
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,850
A flower printed red kimono like this should have been quite expensive during this time period.

576
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,420
For now, should we look for a store that sells kimonos?

577
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,610
That's a good idea.

578
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,560
In this time period's Gyeongseong street,

579
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,160
there was a kimono shop somewhere.

580
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,710
Probably at the end of this street.

581
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:35,170
It's a bit of a walk so let's take the tram.

582
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,150

I'm sorry, but just go. I'll follow you later.

586

If you're in a dangerous situation, call for Son Oh Gong.

587
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,930
It was definitely her.

588
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,780
Excuse me. What year and day is it right now here in Gyeongseong?

589
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,350
It's Moo In Nyeon, first month, sixth day.

590

Ah, yes.

591
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:12,180
Moo In Nyeon... that means it's 1938...

592
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,110
She died in 1939, so it’s one year before her death.

593
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,880
Ma Wang said that it seemed like you learned to dance when you were alive.

594
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,850
This is our dance practice studio.

595
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,870
Does coming here make you remember anything?

596
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,750
Just a really strong feeling of longing.

597
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,990
Think about it more carefully.

598
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,150
I'll get you another energy bead. Wait here.

599

Is that me when I was alive?

Are you a trainee?

603
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,140
You don't know the rules? Trainees aren't allowed in here.

604
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,600
I'm dead tired, so just get out.

605
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,060
And throw this away on your way out.

606
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,040
What is with the smell?

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,040
I'm sorry.

608
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,690
Where do you think you're spraying that? It'll leave an odor! Get out!

609
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,990
You're pissing me off to death.

610
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,740
If you keep talking about death like that, it's possible you might really die.

611
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,370
You're so unbelievable I could die.

612
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:53,420
Get out. A trainee should get their butt out of an artist's practice room.

Hey. What's wrong with you?

A memory of dancing while looking at myself in a mirror came to me.

In the past,

named Akiko.
