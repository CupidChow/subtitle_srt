If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,000
I will always appear and protect you.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,350
You finally appear now, Fairy?

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,370
Now, you're the only one who can call me out of here.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,640
Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, protect me until the end.

[Episode 10]

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,980
I heard the ringing of the bell.

13
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,430
So I misunderstood.

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,830
That maybe we're specially destined for each other

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,980
like a match made in heaven.

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,260
So that's why you're dreaming ridiculous things like this?

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah. But now I know.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,190
That something like this

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,050
will never happen.

Are you regaining consciousness?

24
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,630
Can you tell me what happened?

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:59,300
I'll take away that child with such a special ability who made you unhappy.

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,690
That bookseller...

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,540
told me that she would take away my younger self.

28
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,180
Oh, so that's what happened.

29
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,220
And so that's how you lost your abilities as Sam Jang.

30
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,170
- What?
- You said you asked her to take away what made you special.

31
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,630
Then... she actually did that for me?

32
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,940
All of your powers as Sam Jang

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,260
have now been taken by that bookseller.

34
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,760
Jin Seon Mi, you are now no longer Sam Jang.

35
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,110
Now that you've returned to living as an ordinary human as you wanted,

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,410
we have no reason to see each other again.

37
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,950
Now I'm an ordinary human?

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,000
Sam Jang's fate has now been completely turned over to that bookseller.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,270
Then did her contract with Son Oh Gong also get transferred to her?

40
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,160
Probably. Since the one who made the contract

41
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,110
is the younger Jin Seon Mi who's been handed over to that bookseller.

42
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,740
The kid Jin Seon Mi who made the contract with me is in one of the books here somewhere.

43
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,320
So that's how you were able to call me.

44
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:45,390
Now I am the one who's able to call for the Great Sage.

45
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,280
I am the new owner of the Geumganggo.

46
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,130
From now on, your heart is going to love me.

47
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,280
Damn it.

48
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,200
I can't hold back anymore.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,130
Is the owner of the Geumganggo changing?

50
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,680
The power of Sam Jang and the contract were handed over to her.

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,900
So naturally, Geumganggo's love probably transferred over, too, right?

52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,180
I think so, but there's no way of knowing

53
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,880
whether the Geumganggo was activated by Sam Jang's abilities or human Jin Seon Mi's.

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,800
How could it have been activated by a human's abilities?

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,310
It must have been activated by her abilities as Sam Jang of course.

56
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,020
Then, the one Son Oh Gong loves now...

57
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,710
is not Jin Seon Mi

58
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,850
but rather that bookseller.

59
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,280
That's probably something only Oh Gong knows.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,530
It looks like you're not the owner of the Geumganggo.

61
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,430
You should look annoyingly pretty to me even when you pathetically glare at me,

62
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,680
but even when you're smiling I can't stand the sight of you.

63
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,100
Who do you think you're glaring at!

64
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,600
You can't hurt me. I have the contract.

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Even after getting hit that much, you still don't get it?

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,420
I'm an extremely bad guy.

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,050
Do you think a bad guy would faithfully stick to a contract?

68
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm so bad that that they even put the Geumganggo on me.

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,270
Is that why you're trying to find the book for that woman?

70
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,410
What to do? Unless that woman wants you to, you'll never be able to find it.

71
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,690
She was the one who asked me for the favor.

72
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,110
To take away the specialness which makes her miserable.

73
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,460
She's finally able to live like an ordinary human being.

74
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,940
Do you think she'd be happy to go back to how she was?

75
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,240
No, she probably wouldn't be happy.

76
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,790
Good for her. It's not like I was here to reverse it anyway.

77
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,240
Son Oh Gong, didn't you come here so you could find the book?

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,630
Why would I look for that?

79
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,820
This is a golden opportunity to break that contract.

80
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,150
I should leave it nice and hidden.

81
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,160
If you weren't going to look for the book, why did you hit me?

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,060
Because you put me in a bad mood!

83
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,130
The owner of the Geumganggo? What ridiculous crap.

84
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,300
There's only one person who owns this Geumganggo.

85
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,290
Hey, I'm letting you live instead of killing you,

86
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,260
so continue to hide that book well here.

87
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,040
And if you call me for no good reason, I'll kill you.

88
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,270
I took both her powers and the contract.

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,810
But why is the Geumganggo still the same?

90
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,400
Are the books with the trapped children's souls not here?

91
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,190
Child, how did you get out of your book?

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,170
You spoke with the Great Sage but now you've sealed your lips again.

93
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,140
At least you can come with me.

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,530
She's definitely dead.

95
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,120
Why did she suddenly die?

96
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,240
Yes.

97
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,400
I'm in the stairway of the second floor basement at the broadcasting station. Hurry.

98
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,660
Where did she go?

99
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,060
She was definitely dead but then the body just disappeared all of a sudden.

100
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,270
That woman...

101
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,940
What exactly is she?

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Where is Bu Ja? She's not even answering her phone.

103
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,930
Where are you two going? Take me along.

104
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,100
Why are you being a pest and following me around on my scheduled activities?

105
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,840
There's already a scandal about us so who cares?

106
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,210
There will be news of our breakup soon. We're in our cooling off period, so we can't meet.

107
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,280
I think we can overcome our cooling off period.

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,350
Shall we go to the East Sea? I'll show you around the dragon sea palace.

109
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,200
You've been kicked out of your house. Geez.

110
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,830
Ah, seriously.

111
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,230
Bu Ja! Bu Ja! What's wrong with you?

112
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,130
What's wrong with her?

113
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,590
The zombie seems strange.

114
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,340
Jeo Pal Gye, Prince.

115
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm feeling strange.

116
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
I even fed you the energy beads, so why are you like this?

117
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,710
Pig, when did the zombie get this rotten? She stinks.

118
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,970
My wife is looking after the kids at our home. Are you okay, CEO?

119
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,060
I'm fine.

120
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,960
We almost had a really bad accident on our hands.

121
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,100
Usually I'm not curious and wouldn't ask but...

122
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,250
how did you know that there would be a fire there and save the kid?

123
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,850
It's a little frightening,

124
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,300
but I feel like you're a very special person.

125
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,570
I-In any case, you did something really great.

126
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,700
They said things like that won't happen anymore.

127
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,730
And what about Secretary Son?

128
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,070
It's his job to protect you, so where was he at that moment?

129
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,000
I know, right?

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,310
He used to appear without me even calling him, but now he's not coming.

131
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,130
You are now no longer Sam Jang.

132
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,300
Is it really true?

133
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,280
If you're not Sam Jang, you have no reason to call me, the Great Sage.

134
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,200
If your special ability disappears, I will be gone from your side.

135
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,150
Will that really be okay with you?

136
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,050
Even if so, would you like it?

137
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,290
Son Oh Gong.

138
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,690
Son Oh Gong.

139
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,580
Son Oh Gong.

140
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,230
He's really not coming.

141
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,490
Ah, you're quite beautiful.

142
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:39,380
I came to see the one who gained Sam Jang's power.

143
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,140
Secretary Ma.

[Contract]

145
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,910
Please sign a contract with Lucifer Entertainment.

146
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,160
Are you here to see Hyungnim?

147
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,340
Because he didn't come when I called him.

148
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,200
Is he here?

149
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,290
He is inside.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,780
Please come inside.

Hey, Jin Seon Mi. You've changed.

153
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,260
You knew?

154
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,160
As you wanted, you've become an ordinary human.

155
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,820
Congratulations.

156
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,240
But why are you here? There shouldn't be any reason for you to see me now.

157
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,380
You really won't come when I call you now?

158
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,990
Yeah. I heard you transferred the contract.

159
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,370
Then you won't be protecting me anymore?

160
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,280
There's no need to protect you.

161
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,090
You are no longer Sam Jang, so there won't be any evil spirits after you anymore.

162
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,430
So there's no reason for you to call me, and I won't be coming even if you call me.

163
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,470
Live well ordinarily and comfortably.

164
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,710
What about the Geumganggo?

165
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,950
You're still wearing the Geumganggo.

166
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,230
You don't love me anymore?

167
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,070
Is that how it works? Well, you don't look especially pretty.

168
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,720
Then that's a relief.

169
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,810
Now there's no need for me to see you anymore.

170
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,750
What? The owner of the Geumganggo didn't change?

171
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,040
Even though Sam Jang's ability and contract with Son Oh Gong transferred over to me,

172
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,530
the power of the Geumganggo didn't transfer over to me.

173
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:57,050
T-then Son Oh Gong is still

174
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,320
Jin Seon Mi's love slave.

175
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,350
Gosh, seriously...

176
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,720
Hyungnim, Jin Seon Mi left.

177
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,080
Okay. Ah, I held it in well.

178
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,530
At the last moment, I almost couldn't hold it in and nearly clung to her to ask her not to leave.

179
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,420
You held it in very well.

180
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:53,250
If you take advantage of this opportunity, you'll be able to free yourself from the contract.

181
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,570
Yes. I just need to suppress this wretched love.

182
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,920
Even though you could hide it from Jin Seon Mi,

183
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,870
what are you going to do about Ma Wang?

184
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,890
He'll probably be clingy saying he needs to rack up points, making it hard for me to leave.

185
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,340
It'll be hard to make him give up.

186
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,640
I'll have to approach him sincerely.

187
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,770
Jin Seon Mi didn't ask you anything or cling to you?

188
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,650
Not at all. She just turned around and left.

189
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,440
Right.

190
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,380
She must really not love me, not even a little.

191
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,100
And Jin Seon Mi—

192
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,460
Don't talk about her anymore. If it hurts any more, I won't be able to withstand it.

193
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,960
I won't say anything.

194
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,490
I will never... say it.

195
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,280
You said there wouldn't be any reason for us to see each other anymore. What brought you back here?

196
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,760
You signed a contract with our company.

197
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,350
We can't end it just like that.

198
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,630
Are you on your way from meeting Son Oh Gong?

199
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes. As you said, I'm no longer Sam Jang.

200
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,070
Even if I call him now, he says he won't come.

201
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,920
He said that himself?

202
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,850
What did he say about the Geumganggo?

203
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,130
I guess that's also useless now. It didn't hold any power.

204
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,330
Oh, is that so?

205
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,510
I'm no longer Sam Jang nor the owner of the Geumganggo.

206
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,760
So I don't think there will be any other way for me to fulfill the contract with you anymore.

207
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,990
You're liable for breaking the contract,

208
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,190
so I have to get at least something from you.

209
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,300
Do I have to pay a penalty fee for breach of contract?

210
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Well, you could. Or...

211
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,740
taking a part of your life could be an option.

212
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,210
I'll have to think about how to resolve the remainder of the contract with you who are now a human.

213
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,930
What will happen to Son Oh Gong now?

214
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,670
Son Oh Gong is still wearing the Geumganggo.

215
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,230
So he's probably in love with someone.

216
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,650
Is that bookseller...

217
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,070
the new owner of the Geumganggo?

218
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,190
Since he told you he doesn't love you anymore, then probably...

219
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,400
he'll end up...

220
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,090
loving that bookseller, I suppose?

221
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,660
Why didn't you tell her that he doesn't love the bookseller?

222
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,540
Because I dislike her. I really dislike her.

223
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,600
Why did she have to make things into such a bother like this?

224
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
If you dislike her a lot, then should I kill her?

225
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,100
Forget it. As she wished, she's an ordinary human being now.

226
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,340
Let her live her life well with glee.

227
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,880
Then who exactly is the owner of the Geumganggo now?

228
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,490
Since only Son Oh Gong knows that,

229
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,490
we'll have to watch him carefully.

230
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,600
So you were here.

231
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,390
Ma Wang, what brings you to Sureumdong?

232
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,700
You weren't at home.

233
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,360
It's a suitcase. Planning on going somewhere?

234
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,430
Yeah. I brought it out for the first time in a long while, but it's pretty small.

235
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,660
I was going to put in my statue, the car,

236
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,140
and even the bathroom and leave, but maybe it's too small.

237
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,500
Where are you going with all that?

238
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Are you going far away?

239
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,600
It's too cold. I want to go somewhere warm.

240
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,630
What about Sam Jang?

241
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,540
She's no longer Sam Jang. You know that too.

242
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,070
She won't be calling me anymore.

243
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:53,740
I know. But you're still wearing the Geumganggo.

244
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,540
Jin Seon Mi, who has become ordinary, will live well with glee.

245
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,760
She'll date and get married, too.

246
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,200
Can you really just watch that happen?

247
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,280
Probably not. Because I love her.

248
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,790
Right? You still love her, don't you?

249
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,890
But you're packing because you can't stand to see that happen?

250
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,510
You're the Great Sage.

251
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,970
Instead of doing that, just change her back to Sam Jang again.

252
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,840
If Jin Seon Mi is Sam Jang, she will need you and she absolutely won't be able to live without you.

253
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,080
Otherwise she will die.

254
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,380
That's right.

255
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,250
If I decide to, I could make her stay by my side

256
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,360
and see her every day whenever I miss her.

257
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,620
But Ma Wang, I've become really weird.

258
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Why?

259
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:56,230
I just want her to live an ordinary life as she wanted.

260
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:02,480
Even if... it hurts my heart a little.

261
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Does that make sense?

262
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,140
Even when I just think about not being able to see her,

263
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,050
it feels like my heart is being ripped apart to the point that my tears are gushing out.

264
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,200
But so that she'll be happy,

265
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
I'm here packing up like this.

266
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,940
Does this make any sense?

267
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,950
I guess this is what it is to be annoyingly in love with someone.

268
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,600
Son Oh Gong, you're really in love.

269
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,760
Should I lend you my suitcase?

270
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,160
Even a bus can fit in mine.

271
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,150
Really?

272
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,420
Even a house should be able to fit in your suitcase. Shall I pack my house, too?

273
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,090
Hey, why is that your house? Half is mine.

274
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,510
Leave it behind and just come from time to time to take a bath.

275
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,050
Instead of that, do you want to just take this opportunity and go somewhere warm with me?

276
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,940
You've already said "you pass" enough times.

277
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,320
Forget it. Just go yourself.

278
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,440
Seriously.

279
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,940
To commemorate you coming to Sureumdong, I'll give you a bottle of alcohol as a gift. Take your pick.

280
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,400
Really? That's so unlike you!

281
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,760
But you can only pick from here to there.

282
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,760
So sly. You really are a thug.

283
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,610
Then, I'll pick this—

284
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,470
No, I said to pick from the front.

285
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,840
Always making me say it twice.

286
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
Then you pick one for me.

287
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,860
Then... this one is good.

288
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,150
You gave me a cheap one.

289
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,620
Still, I gave you a good one.

290
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,270
Thank you, thug.

291
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,910
Seriously.

292
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,100
Because Winter General isn't sleeping and staying awake, tonight is really cold.

293
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,030
Because I keep thinking about the poor kids' souls, I can't sleep.

294
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,570
Because the bookseller captured Sam Jang as hostage, we can't destroy the bookstore.

295
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,710
Because of that, we also couldn't save the poor children captured in the books.

296
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,980
It turned out to be a headache.

297
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,870
I could only bring this lost girl who escaped from the books.

298
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,480
The child will not tell me how she escaped from the book.

299
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,680
Elder Soo Bo Ri, more than the bookseller who captured the children's souls in books...

300
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,010
The humans who neglected and abused their kids seem like the more evil spirits.

301
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:48,070
The evil in humans is what makes an evil spirit like the bookseller.

302
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,780
By the way, what's going to happen to Jin Seon Mi and Son Oh Gong?

303
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,710
Jin Seon Mi doesn't want to be Sam Jang. Oh Gong doesn't want to be a guardian.

304
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,530
Just tell everyone to forget it.

305
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,740
Just let them break up and each go their own way.

306
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,870
They call this the love bell.

307
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,900
It's a bell that lets you to know when you meet your match made in heaven.

308
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,370
♫ When I saw you ♫

309
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,920
♫ I think only about you ♫

310
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,730
♫ When I love you ♫

311
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,610
♫ Did you miss me ♫

312
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,420
♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

313
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,510
If you had never appeared in my life,

314
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,480
I wouldn't have become Sam Jang.

315
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,300
I'm packing. I am.

316
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,870
♫ Can we go back ♫

317
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,930
♫ When I saw you ♫

318
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,820
Even if your feelings are fake, I'm thankful and glad that you love me.

319
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,670
It's the truth.

320
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,510
♫ Always behind of you ♫

321
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,990
Alright. From now on, I'm just ordinary Jin Seon Mi.

322
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,300
♫ Always behind of you ♫

323
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,290
This doesn't work either.

324
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,640
Jeo Pal Gye.

325
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,510
I think I'm continuing to rot.

326
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,030
It seems I'm going to rot like this and disappear.

327
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,280
You won't disappear. You're now my younger brother.
(He uses "ahu" which means "younger brother")

328
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,060
I won't let you. I'll find another solution for you to get better again.

329
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,790
Jeo Pal Gye, what were you doing in there?

330
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,620
That's not a place you can go in freely.

331
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,550
Something is terribly wrong with Bu Ja. Where is Ma Wang?

332
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,640
Even if Ma Wang comes, it would be no use.

333
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,970
Why?

334
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,080
The power of Sam Jang has been sealed.

335
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,470
The possessed corpse that woke up with Sam Jang's blood will soon go back to being an ordinary corpse.

336
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,340
If that zombie goes back to being an ordinary corpse, will she just rot and disappear?

337
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,100
If more time passes, she could become an evil spirit.

338
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,600
Before that, we need to burn her.

339
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,090
Hand over the energy beads before I turn this whole agency upside down, you bitch!

340
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,430
Give up, pig!

341
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,470
If Sam Jang's powers are gone, we can't do anything about the possessed corpse rotting.

342
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,050
Just leave her behind. Ma Wang will burn her.

343
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,160
Bu Ja is my little brother.

344
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,500
If we have to, I want to be the one to make her disappear.

345
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,640
Let me take her.

346
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,500
Before she becomes a problem, hurry and get rid of her.

347
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,570
I won't report to Ma Wang.

348
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,050
Are you okay, pig?

349
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,430
This is all...

350
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,220
Sam Jang's fault.

351
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,860
So this is the building where the owner doesn't last three months

352
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,960
and moves out because of panic attacks and nightmares, right?

353
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Yes. This building was featured on "Mysterious Homes"

354
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,450
and "Oh, What a Shock!" too, as one of the top five haunted houses in the country.

355
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,690
You said last time that this was way too scary for you to take a look at, too.

356
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,490
Yes. I want to go inside today to confirm something.

357
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,850
Confirm what?

358
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,020
How ordinary I am. Let's go.

359
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,470
How is going inside a place like this ordinary?

360
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,490
Should I just quit? I'm getting stressed.

361
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,940
I really don't see anything.

362
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,120
CEO, there's nothing, but it feels really creepy.

363
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,620
You're right. Because we can't see anything, it's just creepy.

364
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,410
Ah, wind. Wind! Didn't you just feel a breeze?

365
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,970
I think I've really become ordinary. I don't see anything.

366
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,860
But CEO, do you really plan on buying this building?

367
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,440
Lee Han Joo, from now on, please don't deal with houses that are haunted by ghosts.

368
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,590
Let's try turning over a new leaf and make our Hanbit Real Estate into an agency for normal properties now.

369
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,920
I think we can do that now.

370
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,670
Out of the things I've heard, that news is very welcomed.

371
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,220
I've already wrapped and packed up the car and your statue well so they won't break.

372
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,070
I've also packed a kimchi fridge with the side dishes that you like to eat.

373
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,890
As soon as you move in, remember to plug it in.

374
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,870
Look through carefully to see if I missed anything.

375
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm sure you took care of everything well.

376
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,920
I see Ma Wang let you go quite easily.

377
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,680
I thought he was going to pester you over the contract.

378
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,170
Ma Wang's weak when it comes to love.

379
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,500
I said I was leaving for Jin Seon Mi's happiness, and he believed me.

380
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,640
Ma Wang is someone who has endured through 1,000 years on love alone.

381
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,820
So I guess he was able to understand that it was because of love.

382
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,930
That's why thinking that everyone feels the same way you do is dangerous.

383
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:35,450
Hyungnim, thinking that you're completely different from everyone else is dangerous, too.

384
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,880
So that you don't have any regrets after going far away,

385
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,870
you should check one more time for anything you might have forgotten

386
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,860
so it doesn't gnaw away at you later.

387
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,960
Anything I've forgotten?

388
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,080
Son Oh Gong is packing.

389
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,720
He says he's going far away.

390
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,100
To where?

391
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,260
To a warm country.

392
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,180
If he stays there for a good 50-60 years and comes back, you should be dead by then.

393
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,010
You won't see each other again.

394
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,560
He's going to be gone for that long?

395
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,060
Fifty to sixty years to us is like a blink of an eye.

396
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,050
That's an extremely long blink.

397
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,520
The contract with you, who can't summon Son Oh Gong, is now useless.

398
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,850
If you just tell me one thing, I will destroy it for you.

399
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,630
- What is it?
- About the Geumganggo,

400
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,530
what's the activation method for it?

401
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,160
The activation method? Why?

402
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,280
Giving up on it like this is too much of a waste of the Geumganggo.

403
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,190
I thought it might be still be effective if it was re-activated.

404
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,150
If it's reactivated will Son Oh Gong love that woman?

405
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,800
Yes, that's right.

406
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,040
We need to successfully activate it so he can love in the exact same way.

407
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,120
Most definitely.

408
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,030
How can he do that the exact same way?

409
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,490
Up until lunchtime on Monday, he said he would love me even if the world fell apart.

410
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,930
Well during lunchtime on Monday, he was under your power, but now he's not.

411
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,700
I paid an awfully large price for that Geumganggo.

412
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,520
How many days has it been already? Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...

413
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,050
You can't extend it any longer.

414
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,490
But the bookseller is an evil spirit.

415
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,260
As long as I can use Son Oh Gong to rack up points,

416
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,680
it doesn't matter to me what the bait in the middle is.

417
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,960
It matters to me.

418
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,510
If you're that curious, then go and ask that rascal.

419
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,440
I'm leaving.

420
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,640
Shall I capture her and torture it out of her?

421
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,010
Leave it.

422
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,170
She's still a human that Son Oh Gong loves.

423
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,930
It's best to be cautious with her.

424
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,790
If he loves her so much, is it possible for the Geumganggo's owner to change?

425
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,990
If only I knew the activation method I would try it out,

426
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,030
but she's not telling me.

427
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,080
She's very close to the Summer Fairy.

428
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,450
I'll try looking into it from that approach.

429
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,830
[Hanbit Real Estate]

430
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,960
We need to successfully activate it so he can love in the exact same way.

431
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,710
Most definitely.

432
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,480
Whatever. Punk with no conviction...

433
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,640
Son Oh Gong.

434
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,990
Did you come because I called you?

435
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,890
I didn't come because you called me.

436
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,340
Even if you call me, I can't hear you anymore.

437
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,700
Then why did you come?

438
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,200
I came because I'm going far away, but I forgot something.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,680
What?

440
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,500
A farewell.

441
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,970
A farewell?

442
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,920
I felt like if I just left, I would regret it and it would probably gnaw at me.

443
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:33,030
I thought since we've spent time together, I should at least wish you well first.

444
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,810
You're going far away?

445
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,340
Yeah.

446
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,300
Why? You want to hold me back? You want to cling on?

447
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,370
Are you being clingy?

448
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm not going to do that.

449
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,950
As expected. The kid Jin Seon Mi

450
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,130
told me not to leave, hung on, and was clingy.

451
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,850
But I see that the adult Jin Seon Mi doesn't do that.

452
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,760
You grew up well.

453
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,100
If you are going to say that kind of farewell, say it at the bookseller's.

454
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,290
That Jin Seon Mi isn't here anymore.

455
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,540
I see. I forgot.

456
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,880
The person in front of me is the ordinary Jin Seon Mi, isn't she?

457
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,070
Son Oh Gong, in place of me,

458
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,520
is there going to be a new owner of the Geumganggo?

459
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,510
You're going to do the same for her as you did for me? Is that it?

460
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,130
Are you asking if I love her?

461
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,820
Why? You don't want me to? Are you being clingy?

462
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,320
Forget it.

463
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,170
This is a busy time for us ordinary office workers, so I'm tired.

464
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,910
I want to rest, so leave now.

465
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,580
No wonder you're tired.

466
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,040
Why are you going around with that thing stuck to your side?

467
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,910
What?

468
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,910
What? So now that you've become ordinary, you can't see evil spirits anymore, huh?

469
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,650
No wonder.

470
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,110
If you go around with that thing attached to you, you'll continue to be tired.

471
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,690
Why? Are you looking at me? To ask for help?

472
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,720
Are you being clingy?

473
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,170
Forget it.

474
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,250
Ordinary people just ignore things that they can't see and move on.

475
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,380
I want to ignore it as well. Please go.

476
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Alright. Live well.

477
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,520
Time to withdraw.

478
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,560
- Gorgeous?
- Gorgeous. It's a word we can use

479
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
- at a water park.
- Gosh, it's hard.

480
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,060
- Water park?
- Yeah.

481
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Secretary Son! I thought you quit.

482
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,330
Ah, you came to say goodbye?

483
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,730
You know, we've never been properly introduced.

484
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,510
Jonathan Lee.

485
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,010
Good.

486
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,380
We haven't been close all the while, but it's still pretty regretful.

487
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,230
Go safely.

488
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,710
Can you move for a moment?

489
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,630
Jonathan, the pizza will get cold. Come quickly.

490
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,400
Sorry. Oops.

491
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,460
- Of course.
- Oh yeah!

492
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,390
Spicy rice cake, very good!

493
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,380
Han Joo, I know ddeokbokki, okay?

494
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,390
Is the fan heater broken? It's a bit chilly in here.

495
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,960
Seon Mi, there's a fun musical performance.

496
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,650
Do you want to come see it with me today?

497
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,530
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

498
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,260
Oh no.

499
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,670
CEO, go see the musical with him.

500
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,620
Woah! Wow, seriously what's with things today?

501
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,060
Then shall we go see the musical today?

502
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,000
What's going on? Seriously.

503
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:51,000
Good job. Now, get lost.

504
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,920
♫ When I saw you ♫

505
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,900
Excuse me for a moment.

506
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,910
What's going on?

507
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,200
♫ Always behind of you ♫

508
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,510
Looking for me?

509
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,390
♫ Always behind of you ♫

510
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,850
You have something to say now? Say it.

511
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:32,060
- A farewell. I don't think I got to say it properly.
- A farewell?

512
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Thank you for everything all this time.

513
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,610
Go somewhere warm and live well.

514
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,280
Goodbye.

515
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,130
Hey, Jin Seon Mi.

516
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,200
There are so many things I've done for you until now,

517
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,320
yet all you have to say is "thank you"?

518
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:01,340
My heart went through so much pain until now, but now you want me to "live well"?

519
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,220
And now you're telling me "goodbye" without even trying to hold on to me once!

520
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,720
You've suffered because of the Geumganggo.

521
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,170
Even though the love I poured on you is over, are you really okay with that?

522
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,340
It was fake, wasn't it?

523
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,180
You should be happy now too because the contract with me is gone.

524
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,900
Speak for yourself.

525
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,020
Now that you've become ordinary instead of being Sam Jang as you wished, you must be very happy.

526
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,610
That's right. I am.

527
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,490
Because of a certain someone, I became someone special and lived a tortured life.

528
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,950
It's peaceful now, and I'm happy.

529
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,510
Congrats on becoming an unremarkable person that will never need to summon the likes of someone great like me.

530
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,500
Now live a happy life eating ddeokbokki with all those other unremarkable people just like you.

531
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,840
That's a preservative that will slow down a corpse's rotting process.

532
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,940
There's really no medicine for saving a possessed corpse that's rotting?

533
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,110
- Look for it with your all.
- There isn't any.

534
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,830
Once a possessed corpse starts rotting, it won't last more than a few days even if you feed it preservatives.

535
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,270
Who knows? Maybe if you catch a live human and feed it to her.

536
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,540
That's a really fast pig.

537
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,730
Here, eat this.

538
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,950
They said that if I keep rotting, I'll become an evil spirit.

539
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,680
I...

540
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,980
Just burn me, Jeo Pal Gye.

541
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,530
I found a solution. You'll be okay now.

542
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,320
I smell too much.

543
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,240
It's okay. Ah, this is a secret.

544
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,460
I got hit on the nose so much by the monkey, I can't smell well.

545
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,560
Is that so?

546
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,010
Have two more preservative pills. Here.

547
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,650
Once a possessed corpse starts rotting, it won't last more than a few days even if you feed it preservatives.

548
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:35,030
Who knows? Maybe if you catch a live human and feed it to her.

549
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,300
This is all Sam Jang's fault.

550
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,080
I have to make Sam Jang take responsibility.

551
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,710
The weather is so nice today.

552
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,180
Instead of watching a musical, shall we take a walk?

553
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,080
Shall we?

554
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,980
That child.

555
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,380
Someone you know?

556
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,040
Soo Jeong.

557
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,280
That bookseller isn't going to appear again, is she?

558
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,260
If you have something to do, you can go.

559
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:37,330
No, there is nothing I can do now.

560
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,450
You don't have your umbrella today.

561
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,960
I don't need it anymore.

562
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,410
When you were younger, you always carried your umbrella.

563
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,100
Even when it wasn't raining. Always.

564
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,480
My umbrella, it wasn't meant to avoid the rain.

565
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,430
To me too, you covered me under the umbrella once.

566
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,110
Hey, you—

567
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,560
I couldn't see it with my own eyes,

568
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,590
but you were steadfastly fending off something very scary.

569
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,870
I knew that you helped me.

570
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,060
You're my hero.

571
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,350
You were really cool.

572
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,230
Was I?

573
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:41,350
For some reason, I get the feeling that a rain that I can't see

574
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,860
is also falling on that child.

575
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:57,010
Noona, you can see my little sister, right?

576
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,890
I have something to tell her.

577
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,410
Noona, please help me.

578
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:08,540
Sorry, I don't have that ability anymore.

579
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,700
Because of her, you haven't been sleeping and stayed as Winter General?

580
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,210
Yes, just in case the child felt uncomfortable,

581
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:24,390
I have continuously been watching over her in this form.

582
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,970
But she isn't talking again.

583
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,230
Really? She talked before.

584
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:34,130
I have to take care of the ice cream shop.

585
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,220
Great Sage, play with her for a moment and talk to her.

586
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,940
I don't want to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

587
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,500
Even if you give me ₩500, I won't play with you.

588
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,030
Ah, look at you.

589
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,860
You already got a response.

590
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,500
As expected, she's on the same level as you.

591
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,370
I have to look after the ice cream shop, so please watch the kid.

592
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:13,300
I have to pack— Hey, Winter General, I'm busy! Winter General!

593
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,810
Hey, did you think I would pity you because you're a ghost?

594
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,770
I'm just going to watch you. Don't ask for anything.

595
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,220
Since I let you know how to activate the Geumganggo, try it.

596
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,450
I will.

597
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,980
Now, sign the contract with my company.

598
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,510
Before that, we have to clean up your bad deeds.

599
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,270
Let's release all the children's souls from the books.

600
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,820
And swear that you'll never do that again.

601
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,250
Son Oh Gong, who had committed bigger sins than you,

602
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,980
repented while with me, diligently racked up points,

603
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,090
and started his life anew.

604
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,870
You can also do it. Believe me.

605
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,090
I don't intend to release the children.

606
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,450
- What?
- They were miserable children who received too much pain.

607
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:19,290
What's so bad about letting those children live in happy fairy tales?

608
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,640
If you capture and keep the souls here,

609
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,120
they can't ever be reborn.

610
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,970
Why would you want them to live in this hellish world again?

611
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,160
The children are happy there.

612
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,970
The bookseller won't do.

613
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:49,870
She's a crazy evil spirit that needs to be killed, not made to repent.

614
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:53,200
It looked like she cared for the children in her own way.

615
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,930
Don't be ridiculous.

616
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:00,320
That crazy evil spirit's logic seems to makes sense only because the world is so hellish.

617
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,670
Ah, the best option would be to

618
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,640
get back the original Sam Jang somehow.

619
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,910
How can we do that?

620
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,430
Indeed.

621
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:16,070
If Jin Seon Mi's powers as Sam Jang were restored, then Bu Ja would be able to live again as well.

622
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,960
Bu Ja? What's wrong with her?

623
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,710
Ah, I couldn't report it to you.

624
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:27,020
Ever since the moment Sam Jang lost her abilities, the possessed corpse has developed a problem.

625
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,790
Don't worry. Jeo Pal Gye said he would take care of it.

626
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,050
- Pal Gye will?
- Yes.

627
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,980
But he's dangerous...

628
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,590
- And this one is for Choi Yoo Jin.
- Choi Yoo Jin?

629
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,070
Add a heart too, please.

630
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,910
Yes, yes.

631
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,800
Oh, CEO! You're here!

632
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,370
CEO, PK and I are both following each other's SNS accounts now!

633
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:01,800
CEO, I even farted with him (a way of saying you've gotten very close and comfortable with each other).

634
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,510
Is that so?

635
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,390
What brings you here?

636
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,290
I'm here to pick you up. Bu Ja said she missed you.

637
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,000
Ah, you came together with Bu Ja?

638
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,050
Where is she?

639
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,780
Bu Ja is here?

640
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,740
She's waiting inside that van.

641
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,560
I'll go get some drinks from the vending machine, so go inside first.

642
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,070
Okay.

643
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,010
Ma Wang is coming!

644
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,520
Ma Wang?

645
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,650
There's no time. Quickly get in!

646
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,570
What do you think you're doing right now?

647
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,430
Don't interfere. She's not Sam Jang anymore anyway!

648
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,110
There's no reason for you to protect her anymore!

649
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,080
- Move!
- Bu Ja needs to eat a person to live!

650
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,130
You stupid pig. That will just turn her into an evil spirit!

651
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,090
Out of the way!

652
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,620
You damned troublemaker!

653
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,000
Bu Ja.

654
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,890
Are you all right?

655
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,100
Unni, I'm sorry.

656
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,290
Is there no solution for Bu Ja?

657
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:14,310
Sam Jang's blood that had been providing her with the power to live is gone,

658
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,150
so there's no other solution

659
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:22,310
because that bookseller sealed away your powers as Sam Jang in a book.

660
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,090
When is she going to let the children free?

661
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:29,170
The bookseller said she has no plans for releasing the children.

662
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,160
We need to get rid of an evil spirit like that!

663
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,900
I have no intention of doing that.

664
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,730
Son Oh Gong will protect that bookseller because of the contract.

665
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:41,190
And I will draft up a contract with the bookseller to rack up points.

666
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:45,200
Son Oh Gong is going to protect an evil spirit?

667
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,140
I figured out the activation method for the Geumganggo without your help.

668
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,760
We've formed a new team now.

669
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,690
Someone that's trying to become a deity shouldn't be like this!

670
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,510
How dare you try to preach at me?

671
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,430
Don't interfere.

672
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,830
If you meddle around someone else's business, you might get captured and eaten up.

673
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,240
You even know triceratops?

674
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,460
You're smarter than that real estate guy's daughter.

675
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,020
You were locked up by that bookseller, weren't you?

676
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,150
How did you get out?

677
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,680
If I tell you, what are you going to do for me?

678
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,400
Tell me what you want.

679
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,550
Please protect my older brother.

680
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:55,160
Please protect me.

681
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,850
A long time ago, a kid had a request similar to yours.

682
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,130
But I abandoned her and ran away because it was an annoyance.

683
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,100
I'm a very bad guy like that.

684
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,960
I regret it.

685
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,450
Shall I properly protect this time?

686
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,280
Is Jin Seon Mi going to find the bookseller?

687
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,060
She has to.

688
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:40,650
The only way for her to find her book is to go look for it herself.

689
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,630
I didn't lock them up forcefully.

690
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,670
There's only one way they can come out, but it's simple.

691
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:58,880
If they themselves want to come out, they can come out anytime.

692
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,250
It'll work if Jin Seon Mi sincerely wants to find herself.

693
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,960
I've done all I can to provoke her.

694
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,180
Right about now, she should have gone to the bookseller.

695
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,160
Looks like I have a guest.

696
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,640
I'm here to find myself.

697
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,920
Then go ahead and try.

698
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,760
Jin Seon Mi!

699
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,330
- What are you doing?
- I came here to look for my book.

700
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,340
You came to help me, huh?

701
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:37,040
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

702
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:44,260
- I thought you wouldn't ever come to me again and was so sad.
- You were?

703
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:50,740
I'm glad you're here. You're mine now.

704
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,010
You think I'd fall for the same trick again?

705
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,400
You're taking me too lightly.

706
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,910
I thought I had hypnotized you while you were coming in.

707
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,490
What a waste.

708
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,370
I was planning on using the activation method that Ma Wang told me.

709
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,490
Ma Wang told you?

710
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,600
That loose-lipped cow. How'd he find that out?

711
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,830
Jin Seon Mi, where has she been going around telling everyone about kissing me?

712
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,610
You both said you didn't want to find it,

713
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,410
but both of you came to find it after all.

714
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:50,160
Jin Seon Mi is here?

715
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,000
Where is she?

716
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,830
[Peter Pan]

717
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:07,930
She found her own book but isn't able to come out.

718
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:13,610
[Peter Pan]

719
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,690
You can't open that book.

720
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,860
Only myself and the person it belongs to can open it.

721
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,710
- So you locked them up.
- I told you I didn't lock them up.

722
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,660
The kids don't want to come out.

723
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,310
Just like how you tried to hypnotize me earlier,

724
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,470
you lured those kid's souls here and locked them up.

725
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,710
Open it.

726
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:34,210
I didn't lure and lock them up!

727
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:35,980
You don't know how much I love the children.

728
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,460
Don't spout that nonsense.

729
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,450
Is collecting pitiful children like they're Pokémon called love? Are you some type of evil spirit otaku?

730
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,110
Do you have any idea what kind of miserable lives these children have lived?

731
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,750
For them, living in this world was hell.

732
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,540
I saved those children!

733
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,540
A kid who escaped and ran away from here asked me to do her a favor.

734
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:58,890
She asked me to protect her older brother from being captured here.

735
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,450
Protecting someone so they can live is called saving someone.

736
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:05,100
You're just a monster that takes away people's chance at life.

737
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:09,390
And that kid was able to get out of that book because she realized you're a monster.

738
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:12,510
- I am not a monster.
- That is exactly your biggest problem.

739
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,050
You don't know what you are.

740
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:20,490
You're an evil spirit that collects the misery of children and lives off them.

741
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:30,480
No. I-I'm not a bad, evil spirit.

742
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,780
I love these children!

743
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,500
[Peter Pan]

744
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,720
Come back.

745
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,600
Did you have a lot of fun here?

746
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,050
Even so, let's go together.

747
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,680
It was sad and lonely, but we survived through it well, didn't we?

748
01:03:53,630 --> 01:04:00,190
And although he's very late, that swindling fairy came to protect us.

749
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:05,040
So we won't be scared by ourselves anymore.

750
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,830
Let's go.

751
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,270
Son Oh Gong.

752
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,420
I see you've come back.

753
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,340
I came back because I wanted to.

754
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,950
I'm sorry, Jin Seon Mi.

755
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:02,780
It's okay now.

756
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:26,690
Why are you over here? It's cold. Did you eat?

757
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,960
It must be cold.

758
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,630
Let's start by getting some food. Let's go.

759
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,800
I wish I could also be taken to where my sister was taken to.

760
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,670
If she hears you say things like that, your little sister will be sad.

761
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:47,430
Her older brother has to live well.

762
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,650
Ahjussi will help you.

763
01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:01,000
I can't lie to you saying I'll do everything for you like a mom or dad would.

764
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,200
But, at the very least, in order to help you live a robust life by yourself,

765
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,250
the adults will help you.

766
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:16,500
Don't cry. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

767
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,060
It's okay. Don't cry.

768
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,240
It's okay.

769
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:08,130
Sam Jang is back!

770
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,940
She's back!

771
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:25,790
Ah, Sam Jang is... Sam Jang is b-b-b-b-b-back!

772
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:31,970
Sam Jang is b-b-back!

773
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:36,010
I'm going to make sure I've definitely returned as Sam Jang.

774
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,120
Shall I try shedding some blood to call evil sprits?

775
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,590
Don't do it. Don't do it. I'm tired!

776
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:45,490
I'm tired from dealing with that bookseller.

777
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:49,380
Ugh, there were so many books earlier. It was dizzying.

778
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,890
I almost got hypnotized into activating the Geumganggo.

779
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,880
Activate?

780
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:02,010
Then it really was possible for the owner of the Geumganggo to have changed?

781
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,510
Did you doubt that? Were you worried? Were you clingy?

782
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:11,980
It made me a little upset.

783
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:17,280
Of course it should have. It's yours after all.

784
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,100
Why'd you have to pretend like you were perfectly fine and put me in a bad mood?

785
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,480
The sole owner of my Geumganggo is you, Jin Seon Mi.

786
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:39,680
That's right. Son Oh Gong, the only person who can call you is me.

787
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,250
That's right.

788
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,970
Let's go! I'm dizzy because of all these books.

789
01:08:52,290 --> 01:09:00,390
Don't we need to reactivate the Geumganggo?

790
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,220
Huh?

791
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,400
This time, it's definitely not a calamity.

792
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,700
Activated.

793
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:33,890
♫ I wonder when it happened ♫

794
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:37,070
♫ I don't even remember when it began ♫

795
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,410
This won't be enough to activate it.

796
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:43,030
♫ When I went to you ♫

797
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:47,870
♫ Your heart which kept me from sleeping ♫

798
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:51,600
♫ Made my heart fall though the floor ♫

799
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,280
♫ Which made me shrink back ♫

800
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:04,560
♫ Although your bright smile hurts me ♫

801
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,770
♫ I never felt that way ♫

802
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:18,310
♫ If I can erase everything ♫

803
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:24,140
♫ If only I can find you again ♫

804
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:29,610
♫ The tough days you waited for me ♫

805
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:34,450
♫ At the end of loneliness, I will hold onto you ♫

806
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:41,160
♫ And will stay standing, like a miracle that happens sometimes ♫

807
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:47,520
♫ Even if you brush by me like a flash, I will recognize you ♫

808
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,540
♫ You know that for me, it is still you ♫

809
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:00,500
♫ I, who was always late, am sorry ♫

810
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:07,260
♫ Forgive me for not being able to protect you ♫

811
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:12,590
♫ The days which were difficult and longed for ♫

812
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:17,230
♫ No matter where you are, as long as you call me ♫
