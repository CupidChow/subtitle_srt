[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,470
I endured all 10,000 years of agony.

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,190
Am I dead?

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,040
Ma Wang? Ma Wang!

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,110
The thug is calling me.

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,400
Why is it that I hear that nut job's voice as soon as I die?

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,730
How unfortunate.

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,070
Ma Wang! Ma Wang, open your eyes!

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:58,040
I thought you were gone because you didn't regain your consciousness for a while.

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,310
I'm Ma Wang.

13
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,090
I said I would come back.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,870
Get up. Get up.

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,370

[Episode 14]

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,380
Welcome back.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,450
Have I endured through all 99 destinies' punishments?

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,880
Not 99 but 88.

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,820
Huh? Then there are still some left?

21
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,820
You fainted after going through 88.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,160
If you received any more, you would have shattered.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,450
I need to go on with it.

24
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,010
I can't leave behind any...

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,830
There's none left, none left.

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,790
The nut job, yes, I!

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,450
Here and here, bam, bam, bam!

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,370
I took 10 in your place. Gosh, it hurts.

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,320
Elder Soo Bo Ri took the last one in your place.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,550
Gosh, he says he's a deity but he's lying there like that after just one. Gosh, really.

31
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,860
Everything's finally over now, so don't worry.

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,630
That's a relief.

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,510
But why is it so cold and so dark here?

34
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,600
Huh? What are you talking about? It's well-lit in here.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,460
Huh? Did you say it's well-lit in here?

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,410
Ma Wang.

37
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,300
You can't see?

38
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,070
Ma Wang! Ma Wang!

39
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,530
His body is like ice.

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,370
You really can't see anything?

41
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,460
It seems so.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,410
It seems the world has become dark.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,950
We need to take back my censer again. Go and steal it for me, Winter General.

44
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,430
Stealing it from the Great Sage and Ma Wang's house

45
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,130
by going in myself will be difficult.

46
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,720
The censer has already received Sam Jang's blood.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,670
If I just mix my blood in there, it would be complete.

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,020
Do you really need Sam Jang's body?

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,390
With this body, my power won't become as strong as it once was.

50
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,090
I will make that body mine.

51
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,550
Find a way.

52
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,140
Winter General!

53
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,250
Winter General!

54
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,730
What brings you here, Jeo Pal Gye?

55
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,390
I went to the bar to look for Summer Fairy, but I didn't see her.

56
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,220
But Winter General, why are you awake when it's so late?

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,420
I have so much energy since there's a cold wave, so I can't seem to fall asleep easily.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,390
Ma Wang is hurt. He says he needs Summer Fairy.

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,370
What's going on with Ma Wang?

60
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,030
He got hit with predestined punishments or something, so his body has frozen up.

61
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,560
They think it'd be great if Summer Fairy could warm him up so it feels like summer.

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Wake Summer Fairy up, so I can take her with me.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay. Please hold on for a bit.

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,040
Oh, tell her to come to the car.

65
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,560
It seems we've found a means to get into Ma Wang's house.

66
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,550
So cold.

67
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,520
I also took 10 hits.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm freezing, but I'm sharing my energy with you.

69
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,990
I'm so cold. Can't you hold onto me a little tighter?

70
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,220
Stop pulling!

71
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,460
But just ... Can't I just hug you tight instead? Come here.

72
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,990
I'll let go of your hand!

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
With this, I've repaid you fully for taking the Pachoseon.

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,700
There's still a long way to go. Pay back with some more points.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,090
You still want to become a deity? Wow.

76
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,130
You said you were all about love, but I guess it was a lie.

77
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,520
What happened to Ja Eun?

78
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,190
While you were lying down, she ended her life.

79
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,180
She didn't get her hands bloody with vengeance, and she left without any trouble.

80
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,730
That's a relief.

81
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,460
Since her punishment has now ended,

82
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,860
it would be nice if she could be reincarnated

83
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,890
as the flower she loved so much.

84
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,040
Oh, I'm so cold.

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,990
Stop pulling! Really!

86
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,690
Jeo Pal Gye is bringing Summer Fairy over.

87
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,030
Then it'll warm up like summer.

88
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,490
Summer... it'll come when it comes.

89
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,130
But turn up the heat already!

90
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,240
It's all the way up! Then go stay at the public sauna then!

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,730
You're so inhumane. No wonder you're a monkey.

92
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,090
Ma Wang! Ma Wang! Ma Wang! Oh.

93
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,910
Ma Wang is still alive, right?

94
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,280
Yes. He's not feeling well, but he's safe.

95
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,410
Yes, please go ahead.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Oh, it's so cold.

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,980
Ma Wang? It's seolangcho fruit that flowers in the perpetual snow atop the Himalayans.

98
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,520
You went to that dangerous place to find this?

99
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,370
I should have come a lot sooner,

100
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,500
but I fell into a crevasse and had to crawl out, so I came a little late.

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,260
How about you? Are you hurt anywhere?

102
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,930
Ah, well, I'm fine.

103
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,250
It'll be a big help in restoring your internal energy. Hurry up and eat it.

104
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,480
Ah... this seolangcho fruit... you should have given some to the n-nut job, too.

105
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,590
He took 10 hits in my place.

106
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,760
Hush! It's not time to share it. Hurry up and eat it in one bite!

107
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,160
But... eating this alone is...

108
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,260
I think I dropped one.

109
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,300
I-I feel bad...

110
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,260
After you take this, I'll bring more medicine that are much better than this.

111
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,900
Okay.

112
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,640
Secretary Dog, you found something good, right? Let me have some, too.

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,690
There is none.

114
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,760
I'm certain she found something good.

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,030
I'm sure she gave it all to Ma Wang. There's no sense of honor.

116
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,970
I think there is.

117
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,470
Even though demons seem like they have no mercy, they do have a sense of honor.

118
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,290
Secretary Ma and Sa Oh Jeong both, once they find someone to serve, they're endlessly loyal.

119
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:16,320
To be honest, if you think about it, among human relationships, nothing lasts forever.

120
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,030
For us, once we have a relationship, it lasts forever.

121
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,060
If we commit a betrayal, we pay with our lives.

122
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,840
Summer Fairy is here.

123
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,220
Ah since the fairy of the summer is here,

124
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,850
the air feels so much warmer.

125
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,310
You're deeply injured by freezing poison.

126
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,960
For a while, I'll come to your house and warm it up for you.

127
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,470
Also I'll make some medicinal tonic to warm up your body and leave it here.

128
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,890
Ah okay, thank you. Thank you.

129
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,420
Once you're detoxified from the freezing poison, you will be able to see as well.

130
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,900
But you know, because I can't see and can only hear your voice,

131
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,430
I can imagine your original self that I've seen a long time ago.

132
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,200
You were an absolute beauty.

133
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,750
Of course, you must be a beauty even now. I wish to see you with my own eyes.

134
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,820
Thank you for remembering how I used to look.

135
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,310
Summer Fairy used to be extremely pretty.

136
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,590
Summer Fairy originally had a separate body apart from Winter General's?

137
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,620
Summer Fairy was originally the most beautiful fairy.

138
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,990
That's right. Even Hyungnim had said that she was the most beautiful one in heaven.

139
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,370
Is that so? She must have been really pretty.

140
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,200
Summer Fairy? Of course, she was shockingly pretty!

141
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,590
No matter how beautiful a woman is, Hyungnim Oh Gong wasn't the type to be interested.

142
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,920
No, Hyungnim was very interested in Summer Fairy as well.

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,900
He got the Queen Mother of the West's peaches of immortality for her.

144
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,730
Yeah, yeah! That's right. I remember!

145
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,030
Whoa, my popularity went through the roof back then! Don't you remember?

146
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,130
The fairies had a group fight over who was going to date me and—

147
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,760
I will get going then.

148
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
What? Why? Why don't you leave with Summer Fairy later when she comes down?

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
Forget it.

150
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,300
- You see, she's angry!
- Why?

151
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,170
How can you say that another woman was pretty in front of her?

152
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,180
And how could you bring up the peaches of immortality in front of her?

153
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,720
Hurry and follow her!

154
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,670
Right.

155
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,480
That monkey! Sometimes I really think he's a fool.

156
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,560
Seems like Hyungnim really likes Sam Jang.

157
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,120
If things were normal, he would've gotten mad at you for bringing up fairies,

158
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,310
and me for talking about peaches of immortality, but he just left.

159
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,740
I know, right? If he was acting out of his personality, he would have went "Fire!"

160
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,280
and would have taken it out first but he even skipped that and went after Sam Jang.

161
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,020
If Summer Fairy is here, then Winter General can't work yet, right?

162
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,760
I guess so. Sharing a body with your younger sibling seems inconvenient.

163
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,390
Winter General is so nice.

164
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:33,480
But... do you have any idea how the souls of the two siblings ended up sharing a body?

165
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,210
No. I've never heard about it.

166
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,640
Gosh, I should leave too.

167
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,620
You have to work tomorrow too. You should go.

168
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,990
Yes. I should leave, too, after I put the white kimchi in the fridge.

169
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,310
I'm leaving!

170
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,480
Hey.

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Why are you here?

172
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,010
I followed you. How could you find and get on a taxi that quickly?

173
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,870
I thought the shock of seeing me suddenly appear in the taxi would cause an accident,

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,860
so I got here first and waited for you.

175
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,860
You should have continued enjoying yourself reminiscing about the past.

176
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,810
Why'd you come?

177
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,940
Explosion of popularity?

178
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,500
What's so important about who was pretty back then?

179
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,750
Ever since I wore this, no one besides you looks pretty.

180
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,750
You're the only one that's pretty.

181
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,420
You say that I'm pretty because of the Geumganggo,

182
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,100
but I was a bit pretty to begin with.

183
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,670
You're pretty, you're pretty.

184
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,350
You look pretty even in a ragged outfit and even when you're angry.

185
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,650
You're just pretty whatever you do.

186
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,810
Because of the Geumganggo, no matter how much I hear that I'm pretty,

187
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,010
I always get happy then not.

188
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,650
Before putting on the Geumganggo, you saw me.

189
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,050
How was I at the time?

190
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,880
Try to remember.

191
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,950
At that time...

192
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,700
it wasn't the time to be judging you on whether you were pretty or not, so...

193
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,410
How should I say it? Well...

194
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,120
I was just prey to you then, wasn't I?

195
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
Will she be tasty or not?

196
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,850
Am I a chicken?

197
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,220
Does it worry you a lot that I wouldn't think you're pretty if I took off the Geumganggo?

198
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,980
Yeah.

199
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,390
It worries me that there's no sincerity in what you say now.

200
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,060
Why bother worrying about that? I can just keep it on without taking it off.

201
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,210
I don't want to take this off.

202
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,950
I want to keep loving you.

203
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,590
This is of my own free will so it's sincere.

204
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,080
I understand.

205
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,060
I'm fine now, so you can leave.

206
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,700
Aren't you feeling okay too easily?

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,240
Just keep being angry.

208
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,110
Comforting you is also fine.

209
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,340
Having fights with you like this is also great.

210
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,140
We need to fight over stuff like whether you look pretty or not.

211
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,460
Getting married only after beating up and catching evil spirits...

212
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,310
It's no fun.

213
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,000
I finally understand now the ordinary life that you said you wanted.

214
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,800
Just being together is what makes it great.

215
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,850
The Great Sage Son Oh Gong

216
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:50,480
sincerely loves... the human Jin Seon Mi.

217
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
I'll get going.

218
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,960
Sleep well.

219
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,300
Wait!

220
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,890
For normal people, a choice is needed after a fight.

221
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,120
If you're friends, then you say let's get a drink together.

222
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,590
If you're family, then you say that you'll give an allowance.

223
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,390
And if you're lovers,

224
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,370
just leaving after pacifying isn't the right thing to do.

225
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,070
Then, can I come in?

226
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,620
♫ When I saw you ♫

227
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,540
Yeah.
♫ Always behind of you ♫

228
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,800
Why am I so sleepy?

229
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,850
If it's night, I should be awake.

230
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,510
Is Oppa trying to come back out?

231
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,450
Winter General should be making his move about now.

232
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,670
It's cold, right? Do you want something warm to drink?

233
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,630
Yeah. I'd like that.

234
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,110
Okay.

235
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,180
You went on a trip to Japan?

236
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,220
Yeah. It was a graduation trip.

237
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,610
But it wasn't fun.

238
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,020
Then let's go together later some time.

239
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,400
I'll make everything extremely fun for you.

240
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,120
Sure!

241
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,060
Where are you?

242
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,490
You decided to marry me, didn't you?

243
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,140
There is no reason to continue thinking about it. Just come (get married to me).

244
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,920
At a moment like this,

245
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,540
shouldn't you tell me at least once that you love me as well?

246
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,820
I feel like I've said it to you 26,000 times by now.

247
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,030
I have something to tell you.

248
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,470
Listening to your words earlier, I decided to believe it.

249
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,590
What?

250
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,620
We have a destined fate.

251
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,940
I heard the ringing of a love bell.

252
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,910
They say that if you hear it, the two are a match made in heaven.

253
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,000
They call it an absolutely unchangeable fate.

254
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,970
To prepare for death because of love...

255
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,090
It's too harsh.

256
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,730
The heavenly realm is being too cruel.

257
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,690
I also sometimes think that the heavens are quite harsh.

258
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,570
In the fate connected by the death bell, who is the one that dies?

259
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,670
Could it be... the Great Sage?

260
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,470
Since you dislike Oh Gong, would you prefer that?

261
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,270
I've disliked him all this time,

262
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,420
but now that he's taken 10 hits for Ma Wang, I'll root for him to live.

263
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,520
Then should I cheer for Sam Jang?

264
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,560
Since you're at the bar instead of Summer Fairy, there's no one here.

265
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,760
While Summer Fairy is looking after Ma Wang, I'm going to help out around here.

266
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,960
I heard you took a hit for Ma Wang.

267
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,170
I'll treat you to a drink.

268
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,500
There's nothing that you can't do, Secretary Ma!

269
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,020
Ma Wang has such a loyal dog—

270
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,360
A loyal servant.

271
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,840
It's because Ma Wang is that great.

272
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,360
Not just anyone can love like that.

273
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,330
Indeed.

274
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,290
I wonder if the Great Sage will be able to?

275
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,210
There really was a love bell in here.

276
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,570
It disappeared all of a sudden, so I can't show it to you,

277
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,110
but I heard it ring!

278
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,530
Okay. Let's say you did.

279
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm serious! They say that you can't change the fate of the love bell.

280
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,880
That's why even if I take off the Geumganggo, we won't ever change.

281
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,750
You can't believe it, huh?

282
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,990
But I'm going to believe it.

283
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,990
I can also take off the Geumganggo right now!

284
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,070
I told you, right? I like how everything is right now.

285
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,270
I've no intention of taking this off.

286
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,460
You must not believe in it.

287
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,500
There's no need to risk it.

288
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,300
Jin Seon Mi, don't let me free

289
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,730
and just keep holding me tight.

290
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,280
I'll make you believe in it.

291
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,900
Let's go to the peddler's grandson and ask him about it. I got it from him, you know.

292
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,200
- You stay here! I'll just go and ask myself.
- Let's go together.

293
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,600
No, I'll go alone. You already believe in it. Okay?

294
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,430
♫ I'll hold back my tears ♫

295
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,150
I'll get going.

296
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,970
♫ Don't worry ♫

297
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:06,640
♫ Please just go the way you were going ♫

298
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,950
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

299
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:23,560
♫ Here where I watch you going far away is my place ♫

300
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,100
♫ But then why do I only want to keep calling out to you ♫

301
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,490
If you believe in the love bell, you would believe in the death bell too.

302
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,860
This drives me crazy.

303
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,960
♫ Why don't you turn around just once ♫

304
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,440
♫ Anyway, it's already been decided ♫

305
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,730
♫ Even though I knew this would be farewell ♫

306
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,710
He's not coming.

307
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,510
So he doesn't believe it.

308
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,090
It seems like he still has no confidence to take off the Geumganggo.

309
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,390
The censer has eaten Sam Jang's blood well.

310
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,540
Okay. Now I need to mix my blood in here.

311
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:44,610
- Done.
- What will happen now?

312
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,870
Keep the censer burning.

313
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,490
Take good care of the censer so the light doesn't go out.

314
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,420
Now, the energies of Sam Jang and me will slowly switch.

315
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,550
Priestess, the wedding ceremony to call the dragon for the king is finally happening.

316
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,380
The wedding outfit is so beautiful.

317
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,600
- Is that so?
- Would you like to see?

318
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,080
It seems I'm really getting married.

319
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,500
CEO, are you feeling sick?

320
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,740
I didn't sleep well, so I have a headache.

321
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,180
I had a strange dream, too.

322
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,740
What kind of dream did you have?

323
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,250
It was just me wearing some type of old wedding outfit.

324
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,040
I was really happy about getting married.

325
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Do you want to get married that badly that you'd dream about it?

326
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,420
I know, right? I must have gone crazy for marriage.

327
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm going to the bank and will be back.

328
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,880
Oh my!

329
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,620
Lee Han Joo!

330
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,750
Did you perhaps fall on the streets in front earlier?

331
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,560
No.

332
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,800
I didn't see it happen. What was that just now?

333
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
What?

334
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,090
I just pictured you falling on the street out front.

335
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,410
I didn't see it happen, so why did the thought cross my mind?

336
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,170
I'll be back.

337
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,790
Did she give her soul to Secretary Son?

338
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,100
Oh my! It hurts.

339
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,420
CEO's dream.

340
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,440
Wow, I have goosebumps. It hurts!

341
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,280
Should I take them out together?

342
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,290
Yes, it's almost ready.

343
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,360
Ma Wang, is it okay for you to move around?

344
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,640
- Since you can't see, just stay in bed.
- Stairs, stairs.

345
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm Ma Wang.

346
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,420
Even though my eyes can't see, I can still perceive everything with my other senses.

347
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,000
- Are you a bat?
- I'm Ma Wang.

348
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,330
Are you okay?

349
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:28,040
This is the table, right? I can feel it.

350
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,240
And this is the sofa.

351
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,350
Yes, that's right. It's the sofa.

352
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,240
In this direction are the stairs.

353
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,840
In that direction is the bathroom.

354
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,020
In that direction is the kitchen.

355
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,460
And up top is the ceiling.

356
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,330
How many years have you lived here to be able to find everything so well?

357
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,380
The thug is over there.

358
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,330
That's right.

359
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,090
And the front door is over there.

360
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,400
Huh? Who's at the front door?

361
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,940
It's Ah Sa Nyeo.

362
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,170
Secretary Ma, change the passcode for the front door.

363
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,710
I've decided to peacefully go back to sleep.

364
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,740
Please burn this body for me.

365
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,940
In one sense, I'm just a spirit with lots of resentments.

366
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,220
I'd like to relieve my resentments and look forward to my next life.

367
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,320
Is this the "Home of Legends?" (Old Korean ghost story drama)

368
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,010
Since Great Sage doesn't want to be my partner and doesn't trust me,

369
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,070
you and Sam Jang should burn me.

370
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,070
Would that really be enough?

371
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,340
You believe those words?

372
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,930
I've never deceived Ma Wang.

373
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,250
I've given you the censer. You were able to get what you wanted because of what I told you.

374
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,820
Ma Wang is blind right now.

375
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,750
I already knew I had to make some sacrifices.

376
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:47,630
I just got kicked out of that position because I didn't have the power of blood.

377
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,470
No matter what, you helped me.

378
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,830
I'll also help you and send you off well.

379
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,810
Thank you.

380
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,070
I'll decide on the day.

381
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,130
It won't be too long.

382
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,160
Hey!

383
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,530
Why are you suddenly pretending to be good?

384
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:36,140
Once a bad girl, always a bad girl. You're not supposed to ever become nice.

385
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,270
I'm a bad guy, so I know very well.

386
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,650
I wanted to complete a marriage which I wasn't able to fulfill,

387
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,490
but the one I wanted isn't willing, so I'm simply giving up.

388
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,680
You sure gave up quickly.

389
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
Because your partner is Sam Jang.

390
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,180
I know that besides Sam Jang, no one else can have you.

391
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,070
Or...

392
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:06,670
Would you like to be my partner and marry me now?

393
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,600
Actually, I prefer that.

394
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,170
Great Sage, you are handsome.

395
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,150
Why are you pretending to be Bu Ja?

396
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,770
You used to be nice to Bu Ja.

397
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,570
Can't you be nice to me, too?

398
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,890
I gave her a real life of luxury, didn't I?

399
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,810
Then do you want to go stay in the refrigerator?

400
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,740
Then I can live here too?

401
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,540
Sounds good. In that case, give me a life of luxury, too.

402
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,350
Where do you think you're going?

403
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:51,020
Can't I? I want to live with you.

404
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,220
You're quite a strong enemy. A strong one.

405
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:04,510
Maybe we might be a match made in heaven.

406
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,180
I really hate those words.

407
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,860
Get lost.

408
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,610
Is the censer still safely in there?

409
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,210
Yes, it's safe and sound.

410
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,070
But... the room is so cold.

411
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,780
It's because of the chill my body's going through.

412
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,390
Summer Fairy will come back at night.

413
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:50,820
Don't let Pal Gye know about burning Bu Ja.

414
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:57,030
- If he knows, he'll just do something stupid again.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,420
But it's so cold, seriously.

416
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,170
Ah Sa Nyeo's power must actually be pretty great.

417
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,700
Once Ah Sa Nyeo entered her, Bu Ja became nice and lively again.

418
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,490
It wasn't Bu Ja no matter how much I looked at her.

419
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,330
There's wickedness in her eyes.

420
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,580
Hey Octopus, when exactly are you going back to the dragon sea palace?

421
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,370
- Do you want to go together?
- No.

422
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,620
As for me, I'll inherit this position when Ma Wang retires.

423
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:44,080
I'll start by changing the name. PK Entertainment. Pass!

424
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,000
Compared to the dragon sea palace, this is nothing at all.

425
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Sure.

426
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,790
You should go see the dragon sea palace. Then you'll change your mind.

427
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,000
How did Ma Wang do it?

428
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,560
What's so great about the zombie?

429
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,120
What are you looking at?

430
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,940
The bracelet.

431
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,030
This?

432
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,940
CEO gave it to you, right? It's gold. How many karats?

433
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,320
I don't know. When is she coming back?

434
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,870
She'll be back soon.

435
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,890
- I really didn't want to say this—
- Then don't say it.

436
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:39,660
No. As someone older than you in life, I need to say something.

437
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,220
Secretary Son, after getting that gold bracelet from her,

438
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,940
did you even buy one ring for my CEO?

439
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,390
See? See? I knew it would be like this.

440
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,600
This is exactly why I said this wouldn't work! This is why!

441
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,380
What? Why?

442
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,860
Even though I don't really like you,

443
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,150
my CEO really likes you, so that's why I'm telling you this.

444
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:07,070
Listen carefully. Since you've gotten such a big bracelet,

445
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,130
at the very least, you should buy her a small ring like this.

446
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,940
Aren't you getting married? Then you have to give her a ring, don't you?

447
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,960
- Is that so?
- Is that so?

448
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,580
Since we've talked about it, buy it right now.

449
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,030
Buy it on the internet and it'll be delivered quickly.

450
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,000
I don't have any money right now.

451
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,890
I'll lend it to you! I'll lend it to you! Hurry and buy it now! Now!

452
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,900
No, no. I can get money somewhere.

453
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,990
Oh Jeong, it's me. I need to buy something, so give me money.

454
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,410
- Who is it?
- I have a little brother.

455
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,160
Thanks for your advice. I'll take care of it on my own.

456
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,580
He doesn't even have money to buy a ring and has to extort it from his little brother.

457
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,730
What will happen to our CEO? Poor her.

458
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,140
Oh, I've arrived.

459
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,310
I'll call you later.

460
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,620
Thank you. Let's go inside.

461
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,190
CEO, Secretary Son came by.

462
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,910
Is that so?

463
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,030
Han Joo, did you get hurt somewhere?

464
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,600
Oh this? I tripped and fell. Oh right!

465
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,010
As you said, I fell in front of the office.

466
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,100
The moment I fell down, goosebumps burst out all over me!

467
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,560
How could you have predicted that so exactly?

468
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,970
- Is that so?
- Yes.

469
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,790
Then that baby carriage too...

470
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,200
Oh, it's me.

471
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,810
The bank said no. Lately, it's been hard to get a business loan.

472
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,240
The bank employee said...

473
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,940
Oh my god! What do I do?

474
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,960
Thank you! Thank you!

475
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,850
I saved the child. I seem to have the power to foresee the future.

476
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,780
You saw what would happen to the baby carriage beforehand?

477
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,870
Yes, I also saw that Han Joo would fall.

478
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,860
I seem to have abilities now.

479
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,720
Suddenly having abilities is strange.

480
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,040
If I have to be Sam Jang anyway, I hope that there's more I can do.

481
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,960
Like just now, saving someone

482
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,780
and protecting you, too. I hope I can do those things.

483
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,500
Thanks for that. How reassuring.

484
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,180
I'm being serious.

485
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,670
That's good then. You should wear a geumganggo too.

486
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,640
What?

487
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,200
Shouldn't you? A geumganggo that will make you protect me whenever.

488
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,700
A geumganggo that will make you come whenever I call for you.

489
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,930
It's quite popular recently. Where would you like to wear it?

490
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,040
Here? Or around your neck?

491
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,860
This would be a good place for you.

492
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,930
Now I've also given you something that can never be removed, so let's call it even.

493
00:41:54,430 --> 00:42:00,230
Okay. Since I'm wearing this, I'll protect you.

494
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,570
Call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger.

495
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,920
I will always appear and protect you.

496
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,410
Drink your medicine.

497
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,250
Why won't this chill go away?

498
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,510
If I continue like this, I might not ever be able to see light again.

499
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,750
I'll come more often.

500
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,960
You have to dress warmer.

501
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,470
Put the blanket around you.

502
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,200
Even though I can't see with my eyes,

503
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,800
I can't give up on my fashion sense.

504
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,930
I don't want to look laughable in front of a guest.

505
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:04,120
I'll find warmer clothes for you.

506
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,780
Goodness gracious.

507
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,880
Did Oppa do this?

508
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:51,050
The Great Sage and Sam Jang have a fate that rang the death bell.

509
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,150
So helping to harm Sam Jang

510
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,070
isn't something that's considered betraying the Great Sage.

511
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,630
I have no choice but to do this in order to protect your soul.

512
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,890
Just stay asleep for the time being.

513
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,140
Did you put your sister to sleep well?

514
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,500
Yes.

515
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,940
We'll need to quickly finish this before they figure out we switched out the censer.

516
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,640
By the way, the Great Sage and Sam Jang have a fate that rang the death bell?

517
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
That's too bad.

518
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,760
I've decided to get married.

519
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,230
You're going to give Ah Sa Nyeo the marriage she wanted to fulfill?

520
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,160
Of course I'm not.

521
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,060
Sam Jang's decided to get married to me.

522
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,920
You two can't do that though.

523
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,080
Why not? We're going to.

524
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,310
Then I should prepare for a banquet.

525
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,510
Yeah. Let's do it at Sureumdong. I'll invite everyone.

526
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,330
And I'll make recommendations on what gifts each of you should buy.

527
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,010
Are you deluding yourself just like Sam Jang, huh?

528
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:26,440
You two aren't a match made in heaven!

529
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,110
That remark... no one say that to Sam Jang.

530
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,830
I'm just going to let her continue believing it.

531
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,950
I'll pick Sam Jang's wedding dress for her. Something that's not old-fashioned.

532
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,040
Hey, Secretary Dog.

533
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,530
I really like you for a change.

534
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,050
That's the table.

535
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,040
Ah, it feels uncomfortable.

536
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,530
Because of the death bell?

537
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,770
It happens to be that I became the matchmaker for the two of them then.

538
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,140
The one who locked him up in the Five Elements Mountain was me, and I also got the Geumganggo.

539
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,640
With them like that, if one of them dies, it will feel very uncomfortable.

540
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,570
You're right.

541
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,080
You should tell Sam Jang about the death bell.

542
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,470
It's worse than deceiving someone to get re-married when you're already married.

543
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,910
Do you want to tell her, Secretary Ma?

544
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,990
The Great Sage scares me.

545
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,970
He's not really that scary to me but...

546
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,310
who would be best to break the news to Sam Jang?

547
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,100
There's no one who can do it but you, Ma Wang.

548
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,770
You can't be the matchmaker when deadly destinies are marrying each other.

549
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,380
That nut job is a little...

550
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,020
He actually is a little scary though... darn it.

551
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,830
It'll be tonight.

552
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,830
You were here?

553
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,650
What were you talking about with Winter General?

554
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,830
Jeo Pal Gye.

555
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,610
How do you know Ah Sa Nyeo, Winter General?

556
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,670
What's this smell?

557
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,900
It's lotus flower... and roses.

558
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,930
It smells kind of like Sam Jang. What the heck is it?

559
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,800
You said you couldn't smell very well.

560
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,170
I guess you must be okay.

561
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,790
Bu Ja!

562
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:41,970
That's right. That child is still in here.

563
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,700
I tried visiting a place that she often came to.

564
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,360
So Bu Ja must have wanted to come here, huh?

565
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,300
Of course. Bu Ja really liked ice cream!

566
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,000
And Bu Ja was really close with Winter General, right?

567
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,280
That's right.

568
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,080
Let's have some ice cream, Jeo Pal Gye.

569
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,570
Sure. What flavor do you want?

570
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:09,560
Fruit Loops?

571
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,900
Yes.

572
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,720
- Which do you like out of these?
- Pardon?

573
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,870
I'm asking if you can tell which flavor Bu Ja liked.

574
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Do you think she liked it?

575
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,730
Maybe...

576
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,570
Bu Ja liked this one, too.

577
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,770
Okay.

578
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,600
Ah, I don't want anymore!

579
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,740
This is the one that I like.

580
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,930
Ah Sa Nyeo, I heard that you also had a really pitiful death.

581
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,280
I don't need your sympathy.

582
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,140
Bu Ja died a really pitiful death.

583
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,050
She doesn't even know why she died.

584
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,620
But even so, she is a kind girl who never even thought about searching for her enemies.

585
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,930
Since you're spending time with a kind girl like her,

586
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,510
behave kindly as well.

587
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,560
A grave from the Shilla period was discovered not too long ago in Gyeongju.

588
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,470
The remains of a young man and a noblewoman were discovered in it together.

589
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,580
This looks like the site of a joint burial. You know what I mean by that, right?

590
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,930
Yes! It's when you're dead, you kill the others too so that they can be buried with you.

591
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,400
Yes, that's correct.

592
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,970
As for the shape of the tomb, it's a stonemason's tomb.

593
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,590
Please take a look at the photos in reference.

594
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,190
We'll end today's class with this.

595
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,440
Good work.

596
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,130
Thank you for your work.

597
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,470
[I'm sorry. It was a mistake.]
What's that?

598
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,580
"I'm sorry. It was a mistake?" What's that mean?

599
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,240
[I'm sorry. It was a mistake.]

600
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,580
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

601
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,420
You killed me by mistake?

602
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,290
Who's sorry?

603
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,420
[I'll come for it, wait.]

604
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,430
[I'll come for it, wait.]

605
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,800
Professor! It looks like you made some sort of mistake.

606
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,040
Let's go.
[I'll come for it, wait.]

607
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:54,700
I was told it was something dangerous and fearful.

608
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,910
Is it trying to scare me?

609
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,250
Today is your wedding day. You're happy, right?

610
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,570
Now then, come this way.

611
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:37,050
- What's that?
- What else could it be?

612
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,920
It's the place you will be going into, Priestess.

613
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,620
It was that dream again.

614
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,170
CEO, have some candy.

615
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,470
CEO, what's wrong now?

616
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,500
I feel like I keep having the same dream.

617
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,340
But it doesn't make me feel good.

618
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,210
By same dream, do you mean the wedding one?

619
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,500
Yeah.

620
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,420
Dear dear, that's the kind of thing marriage is.

621
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,530
Thinking about whether or not to do it makes your head hurt,

622
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,470
and then once you've decided to do it, your head hurts even more.

623
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,780
And once you do it, then you have to just completely empty out your head.

624
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,590
Good luck, CEO.

625
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,440
So that Ah Sa Nyeo can fall back asleep well,

626
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,300
please help as well, Sam Jang.

627
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,950
Um, Ma Wang? I'm over here.

628
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,490
Huh?

629
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,270
But I felt Ah Sa Nyeo's energy from this side though...

630
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,990
I apologize.

631
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,250
Sam Jang...

632
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,730
Huh? Sam—

633
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:24,120
Sam Jang, help out well please.

634
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,730
Yes, I will.

635
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,510
I heard you ended up doing what I had intended to do.

636
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,280
It wasn't because I wanted to do it.

637
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,710
It was just because of the special power I possess as Sam Jang.

638
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:02,500
Although I'm in a situation where I am only woken up inside of a dead corpse's body right now,

639
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,120
my past self had special powers much greater than yours.

640
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,160
I could manipulate souls and foresee the future.

641
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,380
You said your blood has the scent of roses, right?

642
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:21,950
Because of those powers, I was used, betrayed, and died.

643
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,420
I'm saying you could turn out like I did, too.

644
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:33,210
But then again, right now you have someone who gives you unconditional protection.

645
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,070
I envy you.

646
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,020
- Did I say I'd take it from you?
- I won't let you.

647
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,470
So be it.

648
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,970
Ma Wang really seems to be quite amazing.

649
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,610
Even though he can't see with his eyes, he can still properly sense energy.

650
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,720
I was certain that Sam Jang was here

651
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,030
and Ah Sa Nyeo was over there.

652
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,420
I already can't see. Am I not able to sense energy either?

653
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:21,620
Ma Wang, you will recover soon.

654
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,420
This is the tissue box. Is that correct?

655
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,870
- That's correct.
- If I'm wrong, you can tell me so!

656
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,680
You're correct! Try grabbing it.

657
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,630
I was right. I was really right.

658
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,170
I was right.

659
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:14,120
This is the remote control. Of course I'm correct again, right?

660
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,070
You're correct. Try grabbing it.

661
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,380
Thank goodness. Thank goodness!

662
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,410
You're very strong, Ma Wang.

663
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,130
You will definitely recover from this!

664
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,650
- I will, right?
- Of course.

665
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:40,270
Good, good. What a relief. A relief.

666
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:47,250
We'll hold the wedding ceremony in the garden in front of Sureumdong.

667
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,990
We'll prepare the reception here.

668
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,060
I'll ask Summer Fairy to make some new wine.

669
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,120
I'll ask the Winter General to make snacks.

670
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,930
And Pal Gye will prepare an impressive reception.

671
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,600
All right, all right. You all work hard on it.

672
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:17,480
Hyungnim, I should only be giving you my congratulations, but I'm very worried.

673
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,730
Why are you going so far as to get married when you know you two have a scary fate?

674
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:27,030
It's best to get as far away as possible from a fate like that.

675
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,620
I don't want to.

676
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,410
I'm going to put that lousy fate right near me and completely destroy it.

677
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:38,090
Great Sage, a wedding is another kind of contract.

678
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,360
It's a promise that can't be broken.

679
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,910
That's right.

680
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,830
This is a new contract between Sam Jang and me.

681
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,780
I ditched our first contract and ran away.

682
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,700
This time I'm going to abide by it until the end.

683
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:03,540
I'm going to risk everything on this contract and fight with the heavenly realm.

684
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,090
If I lose, the one who will die

685
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,470
is going to be me.

686
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,450
Why am I like this?

687
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,920
This isn't a dream?

688
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:55,310
You need to still be sleeping. Why did you wake up, Ah Sa Nyeo?

689
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,290
What are you?

690
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:06,710
What are you doing right now?

691
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:10,620
Why am I Ah Sa Nyeo?

692
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,380
You're Ah Sa Nyeo.

693
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,760
Now, you will become me,

694
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,670
and I will become you.

695
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:27,130
This is a place which connects your dream and mine.

696
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:31,300
I made this place by mixing our blood in the censer.

697
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,930
Do you like it?

698
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,640
I'm... asleep?

699
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,370
Our bodies outside the dream are now soulless.

700
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:17,850
When I go back, I will be entering your body.

701
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:22,650
And you, taking my place, will fall sleep here forever.

702
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:55,040
I wonder since when the censer went missing.

703
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,740
It's impossible for a thief to break into this house.

704
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,810
Wait, wait.

705
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,460
Could it be Ah Sa Nyeo?

706
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,680
Ah Sa Nyeo has never gone up to the second floor.

707
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,000
I was watching her carefully with my two eyes.

708
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,250
Besides the three of us, the people who have been in this house

709
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,120
are Oh Jeong, Pal Gye, Sam Jang, and Summer Fairy—

710
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,820
Summer Fairy?

711
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,650
Summer Fairy?

712
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:27,650
Why would Summer Fairy steal the censer?

713
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:31,380
That censer has Sam Jang's blood.

714
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,980
Why would Summer Fairy take it?

715
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,700
If you go in there you'll be able to sleep quietly.

716
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,000
I'll use your body with loving care.

717
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,850
And I'll do a good job of carrying out the marriage with Son Oh Gong as well.

718
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,610
I'm not going into this kind of place. You can't lock me up.

719
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:58,170
- S—
- You want to call Son Oh Gong?

720
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,820
If you call him, he'll die.

721
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:04,650
- He won't die!
- He got hurt when you called him, didn't he?

722
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,800
Why do you think that is?

723
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:10,730
You two have a fate that rang the death bell.

724
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,530
What?

725
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,010
You know what this is, right?

726
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,480
- It's a love bell.
- Love bell?

727
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,810
You've got it completely wrong, don't you?

728
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:27,290
The love bell is red.

729
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,800
They call this the love bell.

730
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,240
It's a bell that lets you to know when you meet your match made in heaven.

731
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,090
But this black bell looks prettier.

732
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:43,440
Ah! Don't touch the black one!

733
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,570
How did the black one get in there?

734
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,430
This black bell that rang for you is a death bell.

735
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:01,880
This bell lets you know of a deadly fate in which one person dies and the other kills.

736
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,930
One dies and the other kills?

737
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,230
If you get out of here and return to your body,

738
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:12,950
you'll either be killed by Son Oh Gong or kill him yourself.

739
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,080
It'll probably be the latter

740
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,030
since he can't kill you as long as he has the Geumganggo on.

741
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:28,110
Stop, Son Oh Gong! Don't!

742
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,750
He said you'll kill me.

743
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,460
You're the only one in this world who can kill me.

744
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,620
From now on, everything that happens to you is because of me.

745
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,120
So even if I die because of you, there's nothing I can say about it.

746
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,650
We have a destined fate.

747
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:50,290
I heard the ringing of a love bell.

748
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:55,060
Whether the connection is fate or an evil destiny, it can never be untied.

749
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,400
It was a death bell?

750
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,380
Summer Fairy isn't here.

751
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,840
If it wasn't Summer Fairy, then it had to have been Winter General.

752
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,560
Winter General isn't here either.

753
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,920
The scent I smelled must have been the scent from the censer.

754
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:28,440
At that time, Ah Sa Nyeo and Winter General were together.

755
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:50,350
I'm letting you know the one and only way to end the death bell's fate.

756
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,950
All you need to do is stay here and fall asleep.

757
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,550
Choose.

758
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,070
Are you going to call Son Oh Gong, get out of here alive, then kill him,

759
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:09,430
or are you going to disappear here by yourself?

760
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:18,050
It appears that Winter General stole the censer for Ah Sa Nyeo.

761
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:23,040
She must be trying to obtain something by using that censer that has Sam Jang's blood in it.

762
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,720
Maybe Sam Jang is in danger?

763
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,770
If she's in danger then she would have already called for Son Oh Gong.

764
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,220
She's probably fine.

765
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,730
Quickly find Ah Sa Nyeo.

766
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,610
Jin Seon Mi!

767
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,720
Why are you like this, Jin Seon Mi? Sam Jang!

768
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,860
What's wrong with Sam Jang? Is she dead?

769
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,350
No. She's sleeping.

770
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,390
Then why isn't she waking up?

771
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,550
This is Ah Sa Nyeo's doing.

772
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,100
She said she could manipulate souls.

773
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:20,030
Then did she take Sam Jang's soul somewhere?

774
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,940
This is dangerous.

775
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,960
I can't find where she is.

776
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,900
If she's in danger then she would call you, wouldn't she?

777
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,360
You're going to sleep for eternity.

778
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:04,050
♫ It was probably destiny ♫

779
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,460
♫ It was probably pre-destined ♫

780
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,770
♫ Even including when we first met ♫

781
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,820
Where are you?

782
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:15,500
Call for me.

783
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,420
Call for me, Jin Seon Mi!

784
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:24,000
♫ When love is never ending ♫

785
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,160
♫ Like the night when even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds ♫

786
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:37,350
♫ My heart is turning black ♫

787
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:44,420
♫ I am boxing up the longing in the pouring rain and letting it go ♫

788
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:50,760
♫ I am afraid you might forget me ♫

789
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:57,390
♫ If it were destiny, I will accept it ♫

790
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:04,360
♫ If so-called love becomes a sin ♫

791
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,760
♫ I will be able to see you again ♫

792
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,460
♫ If you truly love ♫

793
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:19,920
♫ If we were truly destined ♫

794
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:27,680
♫ Even the sound of the falling rain all night is sad ♫

795
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:33,080
♫ It seems it knows how I feel ♫
