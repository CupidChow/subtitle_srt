4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,070
If you want to save another human, take off the Geumganggo.

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,370
If you do nothing, he'll get ripped to death by that possessed corpse.

6
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,670
Why are my shoelaces undone? Is someone longing for me?
(superstition)

7
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,220
My little Han Byeol must be thinking of her daddy.

8
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,750
There's no time to waste, Sam Jang. Hurry up and take it off.

9
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,850
You can't.

10
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,430
What are you doing? Take this off already.

11
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,220
There is no need for that.

12
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,380
Go and save your colleague.

13
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,140
The Great Sage will follow you.

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,590
I don't save anyone but you.

15
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,770
If you leave it as is, that human will die.

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,040
Sam Jang, please believe in the power of the Geumganggo.

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,610
Take it off.

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,330
You didn't leave me alone to be scared, lonely, or tormented.

19
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,160
Son Oh Gong, please help me.

20
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,040
Even if Sam Jang runs there, it'll be too late. That human will die.

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,450
He won't die. Because before that happens, you'll go to save him.

22
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,390
I'm not going.

23
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,500
You won't be able to help but go there.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,900
If you're someone who can't let her be scared, lonely, or tormented,

25
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,690
you will never be able to let her be sad either.

26
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,900
The tears of Sam Jang...

27
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,950
Will you be able to bear them?

28
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,680
Han Joo!

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,560
Han Joo! Wake up, Han Joo!

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,650
Han Joo!

31
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,190
Please wake up.

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,760
Just thinking about it is painful, isn't it?

33
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,260
No... I'm fine.

34
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,990
You fool... You're fine?

35
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,900
Her pain is your pain.

36
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,400
If she is hurting,

37
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,040
you will hurt as well.

38
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,100
Then from now on, whenever she's crying, I will continue to be in pain like this?

39
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,100
Why should I be?

40
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,970
Why should I be?!

41
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,180
Love.

42
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,410
- Who are you?
- Get lost.

43
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,000
- Excuse me?
- I said get lost.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
Why?

45
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,250
If I tell you to go, just go already.

46
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,230
Lee Han Joo!

47
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,620
CEO, be quiet.

48
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,670
Are you alright? I'm so relieved.
[Episode 4]

49
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,480
There's someone in your house right now.

50
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,830
I was about to leave after dropping the package off, but there was a man there.

51
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,240
He looks a little familiar, but anyway, he suddenly appeared and shocked me to death!

52
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,770
- He came.
- What do you mean he came?

53
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,880
It's a relief to see you alive.

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,900
You can leave now.

55
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,820
Relieved because I'm alive...?

56
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,860
Then I almost died?

57
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,220
Son Oh Gong, I see you did come.

58
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,700
This Geumgango has more power than I thought.

59
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,060
It's as Ma Wang said. Your shit is my shit.

60
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,660
I think I'm going to end up cleaning up after your mess.

61
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,300
I'm the Great Sage, the equal of heaven.

62
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm not someone who should be cleaning up after a mere human all day.

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,850
I got caught in an unbelievable situation.

64
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm sorry. In order to save my own life, I took a hold of your ankle—

65
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,070
I mean, I took a hold of your wrist. I have nothing to say even if you hate me.

66
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,480
It would only be natural to hate you, but I can't do that right now.

67
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,730
Not removing this Guemganggo earlier was a wise decision.

68
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,570
If you took it off, I would have killed you right away.

69
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,290
You protecting me...

70
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,950
You're saying that it's only because of the Geumganggo.

71
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,500
Of course. The one protecting you is not me, but this Geumganggo.

72
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,490
I'll take care of this.

73
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,510
Bravo.

74
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,530
I've confirmed the power of Geumganggo myself.

75
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,800
The Great Sage will never be able to disobey Sam Jang.

76
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,620
The Great Sage won't stand by and do nothing if he finds out about the contract.

77
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,980
Of course, he wouldn't stand still.

78
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,150
[Lucifer]

79
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,470
The Great Sage must be close.

80
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,460
I'll take the contract for safekeeping.

81
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,400
Ma Wang, this is not the real contract, is it?

82
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Of course not.

83
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,090
I can't let the Great Sage get a hold of the real contract.

84
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,270
Where is the real one?

85
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,080
I know, right?

86
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,270
Great Sage!

87
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,430
Ma Wang, the Great Sage is here.

88
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,670
Darn. You seemed to want to watch me act like a dog,

89
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,880
so I really came as one,

90
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,910
but it's not any fun.

91
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,570
At which point did you realize, I wonder?

92
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:33,360
When we say cheers, Secretary Ma prepares two wine glasses. Clink!

93
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,900
So we can drink together.

94
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,010
But you're banned from drinking right now, right?

95
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,460
Having this delicious wine in front of me

96
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,880
but not being able to drink it, it's been very upsetting.

97
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,300
Now I'm even more pissed.

98
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,210
I'll get to the point.

99
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,450
- Destroy the contract.
- It's a contract between Sam Jang and Lucifer Entertainment.

100
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,600
What right do you have?

101
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,490
I'm tied to Sam Jang in a very confidential manner, so I can't stand by and let an unfair contract go through.

102
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,730
Contractually, there's no problem one way or another.

103
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,120
If there is no problem yet, we can always create one.

104
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,310
The contract has Lucifer Entertainment as the employer, right?

105
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,270
But what if the employer from that contract disappears?

106
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,490
The building was built so well.

107
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,350
What a waste.

108
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,480
Are you crazy? You're saying you'll destroy a building that's sitting in the middle of the city?

109
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,250
As you know, I'm not a nut job that's gently crazy, no?

110
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,690
Cheers!

111
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,790
Aigoo! What's going on?!

112
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,950
Get out! Get out!

113
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,690
Great Sage, were you decanting this for me so I could enjoy it?

114
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,130
Your building is very sturdy, I see.

115
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,310
Of course. It won't be affected by the strength like that of a baby shaking his rattle.

116
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,780
Ah, I was too arrogant to think that I could finish it off with one finger.

117
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,550
This time, I'll do it properly.

118
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,720
Okay.

119
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,250
Just try it.

120
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,230
I was almost late.

121
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,670
I flew here without having a chance to breathe!

122
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm so thirsty.

123
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,760
Now, now. Let's stop this and come to an agreement by talking.

124
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,990
Is he someone you can talk sensibly to right now?

125
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,620
This is strange, and this as well.

126
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,260
Take a look for yourself. This contract used

127
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,910
Sam Jang as bait to get me involved!

128
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,720
That means he's trying to gain points to become a deity by using me!

129
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,380
The reason why I haven't become a deity yet is because of you.

130
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,590
The points I lost because you escaped from the Five Elements Mountain

131
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,580
I'm trying to gain back by using you! What's so unfair about that?

132
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,260
So are you saying this contract makes sense right now?

133
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,870
Now, now. I see both of your positions.

134
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,390
I will sort this out as a representative of the heavens.

135
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:31,610
Let's add just one more clause to this contract and come to an agreement.

136
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,600
Let's decide on a timeframe.

137
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,890
This contract will be valid only up to the day Sam Jang fulfills her summons.

138
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,060
The day she fulfills her summons, the Great Sage will gain his freedom.

139
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,340
How about it? If you stack up some points well until then,

140
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,260
you will become a deity without a problem.

141
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,370
Well, it doesn't sound too bad.

142
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,930
I don't like it. I feel like I'm continuously getting the shorter end of the stick.

143
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,190
But you've committed a lot of sins.

144
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,980
All those sins will be written off and the no-alcohol ban will be lifted,

145
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,870
so there's nothing for you to lose.

146
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,850
So when Sam Jang's summons is fulfilled, you'll really take this off of me?

147
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,590
Of course. The day she fulfills her summons,

148
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,440
any relationships that is bound by the Geumganggo will all be over!

149
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,300
You sure you're not up to some crap again?

150
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,250
After saying this, you sure you're not going to drag this out for hundreds of years saying it's Sam Jang's summons or whatever?

151
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,730
A human's life is at most around 100 years.

152
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,480
Sam Jang will die within a few decades too, so it will end within that time.

153
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,750
Don't talk about her dying! It's sad.

154
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm saying it's going to end soon.

155
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,270
Then we'll add the clause we agreed upon,

156
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,770
and I will keep this contract safe.

157
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,090
Hold on. I haven't agreed to it yet.

158
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,350
I'm going to make a scene until the very end.

159
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,990
Why? What else do you want?

160
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,400
Give me your house.

161
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,790
I've asked a real estate office to find a house for you to move into. You'll move in soon. Good?

162
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,130
- Good, but
- Okay, good.

163
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,320
I like that house with easy parking and a big bathroom. Give me that house.

164
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,240
I've worked hard for many years for that site.

165
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,420
That's why I want it.

166
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:19,060
I'll go and rest comfortably there, so call me when you transfer the title, okay?

167
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,390
That punk!

168
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,320
Ma Wang, just take the high road.

169
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,010
This contract is advantageous for you anyway.

170
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,230
It's a relief it ended at this point with the Great Sage's horrible temper.

171
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Let's change the title of the house to a joint ownership.

172
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,450
Ah, that idiot, seriously.

173
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,060
Just throw that house away. I'll find another lot.

174
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,650
No.

175
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,320
He's insisting on that house just to torment me.

176
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,480
I can't give in first.

177
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,550
Okay, I'll stick around,

178
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,190
so let's both be tormented, huh?

179
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,620
Are you all right, Ma Wang?

180
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,420
You used too much of your powers earlier.

181
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,300
It's okay. I'm Ma Wang.

182
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,720
Using that mere amount of power—

183
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,330
I...

184
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,340
I will never collapse!

185
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,350
Ma Wang. Nosebleed!

186
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,590
It's just red snot.

187
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,470
Ma Wang, it would be better to stop it all.

188
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,940
What meaning is there in becoming a deity after practicing asceticism for a thousand years?

189
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,230
You were much stronger before.

190
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,240
It would be better if you just eat Sam Jang.

191
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,350
Then, you will be stronger than anyone else.

192
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,480
If you give your permission, I will bring her to you even at the cost of my own life.

193
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,010
Secretary Ma, I have to become a deity.

194
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,990
Only then can I have a hand in the fate and life of a human.

195
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,230
Only by being a deity can I save her.

196
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,640
I was shortsighted.

197
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,550
I understand your loyalty well.

198
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm okay, so just give me a tissue.

199
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,200
He's picking his nose! Take a picture!

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,890
Students, I did not pick my nose.

201
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,130
He picked his nose!

202
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,050
I told you it's not like that. Delete those pictures.

203
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,620
Delete those photos!

204
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,640
Those kids are Jeo Pal Gye's fans, right?

205
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,000
What if they upload the photo on social media saying it's a picture of me picking my nose?

206
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,480
- Shall I kill them?
- Yes, kill— I mean, no. Don't kill them.

207
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,790
Chase after them and delete those pictures.

208
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,300
Got it.

209
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,880
I said I wasn't picking my nose.

210
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,570
If I was picking my nose, I'd bury my finger in here like this

211
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,420
and there would be some movement left and right. Wiggle, wiggle!

212
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,360
Who would put it only half way in? I know they saw that!

213
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,220
Grandmother, lately that crock of misfortune has been sobbing over and over.

214
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,380
The cries aren't ordinary.

215
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,210
Will there be an enormous calamity in the human world?

216
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,560
So you sold me off to Ma Wang then.

217
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,750
Should I have taken the Geumganggo off?

218
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,660
♫ When I saw you ♫

219
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,600
If you had taken it off, I would have killed you right then and there.

220
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,680
Not taking it off was a good call.

221
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,990
♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

222
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,690
But instead, I won't call for you if I can help it.

223
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,800
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

224
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,180
♫ Can we go back ♫

225
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,480
♫ When I saw you ♫

226
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,540
The day the no-alcohol ban is lifted, I'll drink them all.

227
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,690
♫ Always behind of you ♫

228
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,220
I can wait if I know that there is a definite end.

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,810
♫ Always behind of you ♫

230
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm only handing over half of this house, okay?

231
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,930
I will definitely come back for you.

232
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,470
At least it will be amusing to watch the monkey

233
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,210
flail around from being in love.

234
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,500
At least polish it well if you've brought this in here.

235
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,760
It's so dirty.

236
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,690
There. It's clean now.

237
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,750
I ate so much but lost 500 grams!

238
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,070
It's so great.

239
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,610
I'm so tired. So tired.

240
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,120
Oh, you startled me!

241
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,980
Hello.

242
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,050
What are you?

243
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,190
Me? I'm not sure about who I am myself.

244
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,010
I just followed Oppa Oh Gong.

245
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,150
Oppa Oh Gong?

246
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,930
I told you he's not oppa!

247
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,690
He's Son Oh Gong-nim. Son Oh Gong-ni—

248
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,410
I'm the oppa. Me! Oppa Pal Gye!

249
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,850
But I like Oppa Oh Gong better.

250
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,830
Who is this girl that's saying she likes Oppa Oh Gong?

251
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,980
Her? A possessed corpse.

252
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,780
By possessed corpse you mean that zombie that was in Sam Jang's house yesterday?

253
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,300
Why is she in here?

254
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,630
Ah, about that. Hyungnim Oh Gong told me to keep her at this house,

255
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,590
but she stunk so bad that I told her to stay in there.

256
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,870
Ah, seriously...

257
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:55,270
The cold air is being let out so could you possibly please close the door?

258
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,000
Of course. Rest.

259
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,760
Ma Wang, don't mind it.

260
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,200
There's a rotting corpse in my fridge.

261
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,590
How am I supposed to not mind that?

262
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,900
Yes.

263
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,430
Ugh, the stench...

264
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,920
Come out. We need to talk.

265
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,250
When I opened my eyes I was in the mountains

266
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,610
and some men were trying to bury me.

267
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,260
Were you being secretly buried after being murdered?

268
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm not sure.

269
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,780
I don't remember anything.

270
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,580
Her brain must have rotted.

271
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,910
But how did you find Sam Jang?

272
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,660
I just...

273
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,200
had one thought of needing to go somewhere.

274
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,950
And I ended up there.

275
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,380
Hyungnim Oh Gong said he thinks she woke up from the dead because of Sam Jang's blood

276
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,960
so we should take her in for the time being.

277
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,010
Even so, how you could you bring a rotting and smelly corpse into my home?

278
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,000
No wonder there's been a foul stink in here since the morning.

279
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,440
It's not like we could've left her at Sam Jang's.

280
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,270
At least after she has consumed some of those energy beads,

281
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,320
so she has gotten brain power back, her eyes are open, and she can even talk.

282
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,260
Energy beads? Don't tell me you gave her my energy beads?

283
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,550
Hyungnim Oh Gong told me to feed them to her.

284
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,950
Have you no idea how valuable those are that you fed them to a zombie?!

285
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,900
Ah, this damn monkey.

286
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,000
He did this on purpose just to piss me off.

287
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,440
He brought something that's dirty and smelly - what I hate the most - into my house.

288
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,250
Hyung Oh Gong said it wasn't your house anymore, but his.

289
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,330
Whether you're going to take care of her or abandon her, you two figure that out yourselves.

290
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,210
I have a lot on my schedule today, so I'm out of here.

291
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,090
Oppa is leaving now.

292
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,220
You really stink. Can't you move back some?

293
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,190
I'm sorry I'm smelly. I will quietly stay in the fridge then.

294
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,620
No! Don't go in there!

295
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,340
Come outside with me.

296
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,740
But how am I supposed to take her out?

297
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,310
So messy and smelly...

298
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,530
I came here yesterday in a bag.

299
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,830
Hey. Did you eat something when you were in the fridge?

300
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,980
There's no way you should be this heavy.

301
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,470
120 kilograms...

302
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,740
She's 120 kilograms...

303
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm sorry.

304
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,110
It stinks. So smelly.

305
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,170
Are you going to work?

306
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,450
- Ah, yes.
- You must be going on a business trip.

307
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,660
- Well, sort of...
- Let me do it— oh!

308
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,760
I'm sorry. It's just that there's this strange smell...

309
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,580
It's like something rotting...

310
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,490
Oh, no, no!

311
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,930
This is a secret.

312
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,700
This smell is mine.

313
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,310
My body odor is quite strong.

314
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,130
I haven't been able to shower for a few days and... phew wee!

315
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,300
It's terribly potent.

316
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,500
Ah, yes. But still, I should–

317
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,480
Just leave it be. I'll do it.

318
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,450
- But, still—
- No!

319
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:45,120
Can't you please just leave it and go? Please?

320
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,790
Then have a safe trip.

321
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,910
This is not right.

Don't breathe with your nose.

Secretary Ma, take care of the thing inside.

326
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,370
- Shall I kill it?
- It's already dead.

327
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,610
Then shall I throw it away?

328
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,700
No, if you just— ugh.

329
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,620
If you just throw it out as is, it will just crawl out and roam about.

330
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,050
It came alive thanks to Sam Jang's blood, so tell her to take care of it.

- That's everything. Please confirm.
- Okay.

Who is this?

333
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,090
Oh? Yes, I know.

334

Where did you say you were?

Excuse me? Alright, I'll be right out.

Yes, go ahead.

Thank you for your time today. I'll see you on the moving day. Take care.

Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

Huh?

Oh my God. Our CEO is doing a duet with PK?!

344
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,460
CEO!

345
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,790
O-Outside, th-that was PK, right? The PK?

346
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,720
Yes. It looks like I'm going to have to go out for a while to do some work for Lucifer Entertainment.

347
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,170
For a Lucifer Entertainment event?

With PK?

349
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,060
Well, yes.

350
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,470
Wow. From what I saw earlier, the bag of equipment is huge!

351
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,320
It must be a really big event.

352
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,290
Are you going somewhere far? A countryside event? An overseas concert?

353
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,290
This is my first time so I don't know how far I'll be going or how long it'll take.

354
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,480
I'll come back soon, so take care of the real estate business for me until then.

355
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,590
Aigoo, don't you worry one bit about that.

356
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,150
Honestly when I heard that you were going to events,

357
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,850
I thought you'd be going to some regional celebratory event.

358
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:46,090
But an event with PK? Wow, salute! Salute! Salute!

359
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,990
We'll let you out at a suitable location, so Sam Jang, burn her yourself and get rid of her.

360
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,970
How could you say something so horrific?

361
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,760
Him?

362
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,420
Ah, he's also a demon.

363
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,210
Hello.

364
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,560
She said she doesn't know how she was killed, right? What a shame.

365
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,720
It really is. Her family could be looking for her

366
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,620
but they won't be able to find her body.

367
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,040
She'll remain a missing person forever.

368
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,690
Jeo Pal Gye, let's not burn her yet.

369
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,320
We should at least find out her name so she will know who she is.

370
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,900
She's a possessed corpse. A zombie! Don't you get that?

371
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,380
If you leave her be, she'll slowly start turning into an evil spirit.

372
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,440
Since she revived because of your blood,

373
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,920
you have to be the one to eliminate her before she turns.

374
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,480
And, the smell is perfectly awful.

375
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,380
Let's try to figure it out before she turns into an evil spirit and if we can't figure it out, we'll burn her then.

376
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,350
and if we can't figure it out, we'll burn her then.

377
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,970
I ask of you, Jeo Pal Gye.

378
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,760
Is this my chance?

379
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,360
Please? Jeo Pal Gye?

380
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,740
I'm sorry I'm smelly.

381
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,330
Since we're in a tight situation, we're going to need you to freeze her so she stays fresh instead of rotting.

382
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,520
Ah, Sam Jang, this is Winter General.

383

Hello, I'm Jin Seon Mi.

384

I've heard a lot about you from the Great Sage.

385
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,590
Please do us this favor.

386
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,800
Then I'll try freezing her.

387
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,480
Wait just a minute! She will need to walk around so you don't need to completely freeze her.

388
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,950
It would be quite difficult to maneuver when you're frozen solid.

389
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,190
Then how about doing the equivalent of a crunch, thin ice mode of a kimchi fridge?

390
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,650
Just enough to keep her fresh and alive.

391
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,970
Yes, of course.

392
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,510
Now, then. It's going to get cold.

393
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,850
I see that Oppa did a good job adjusting your body temperature so it won't rot anymore.

394
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,040
She's speckled with cuts and scrapes everywhere so use your make-up to cover them up.

395
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,230
It should be possible with your make-up skills.

396
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,800
Ah, Sam Jang. This is Summer Fairy, Winter General's younger sister.

Hello, I'm Jin Seon Mi.

398
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,740
Oh my, Jin Seon Mi, you're much too boring. Too sombre.

399
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,730
I'll need to give you some make-up and add a little color to you.

Well, that is true.

401
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,590
But today, we didn't come for her, but for that girl over there.

402
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:50,180
This one first, and not this one. I apologize.

403
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,720
Baby, come with me.

404
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,160
Is that person not the one from before?

405
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,290
No, they are completely different.

406

One body two souls. Winter General is the male and Summer Fairy is the female.

407

They're siblings. Brother and sister.

I told you to be careful.

416
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,320
We'll be right back after re-fixing her eye. Just the eye.

417
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,810
We're going to have to be careful in the future if we're going to take her around with us.

This towel that the zombie was wrapped in.

She must be dead!

475
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,740
Whatever. I should call him when I see something like this.

476
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,960
- Son Oh—
- There's a dead person!

477
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,180
Someone died! Hurry!

478
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,410
Bu Ja!

479
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,870
Bu Ja! Wake up! Bu Ja!

480
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,030
Unni, I dozed for a little while.

481
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,890
Get up quickly and let's leave. Quickly.

482
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,460
A person died.

483
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,500
A female member was hurt using the exercise equipment and she was lying here, so I came by.

484
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,190
When I came, she was dead—

485
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,320
What's this?

486
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,140
There was a dead girl here though.

487
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,550
Ajusshi, I think you were very tired.

488
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,870
Get your head on straight, okay?

489
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,290
Not at all.

490
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,590
Go on home.

491
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,350
[Congratulations on getting your own house, Hyungnim Son Oh Gong
Younger brother Sa Oh Jeong]

492
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,050
- Welcome.
- Hyungnim.

493
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:46,630
The lawyer took care of the joint ownership registration of this house without any problems.

494
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,480
You found a good house. Congratulations.

495
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,840
Good job.

496
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,130
Now that it's my house, you can come often without tip toeing around Ma Wang.

497
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,620
Will Ma Wang continue to stay with you here?

498
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,750
He's got no other place to go. I told him I'd take him in.

499
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,220
You can take off your coat and hang it there.

500
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,160
Yes.

501
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:15,390
Yo, Oh Jeong. I also came to congratulate Hyungnim Oh Gong.

502
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,710
Jeo Pal Gye was here as well.

503
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,900
Oh Jeong, come here too and sit.

504
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,850
May I start doing chores first, Hyungnim?

505
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,380
Yes, if it pleases you.

506
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,170
Thank you.

507
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,060
As expected, because Oh Jeong touched the family home, everything sparkles.

508
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,750
Thank you for your acknowledgement, Hyungnim.

509
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,770
Then from now on, Oh Jeong will do all the housekeeping?

510
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:45,260
For all this time, it was Ma Wang's house so I couldn't come in,

511
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,640
but now it's Hyungnim's home, so of course, I will come and look after him.

512
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,570
You have said that more than being a CEO,

513
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:56,640
sweeping, wiping, organizing, and cleaning up are your greatest joys.

514
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,230
You must be happy to have found something to do.

515
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,370
May I take out the curtains and the carpet and dry them when it's nice and sunny out?

516
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,460
Do as you wish.

517
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,840
I've got a message saying she brought the zombie here.

518
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,090
Me, too. Tell her I'm coming down to get her.

519
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,740
Okay.

520
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,260
What is it? Who's that from?

521
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,320
Ah yes, it's Sam Jang.

522
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,900
You chat with her on KakaoTalk?

523
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,730
Yes. She sent a message saying that she's out front with the possessed corpse.

524
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,770
Then why did Pal Gye get a KakaoTalk message at the same time?

525
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,690
It's a group chat room.

526
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,790
A group chat room?

527
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,430
Sam Jang made a group chat with us to be able to talk about the possessed corpse situation.

528
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,740
A group chat? With only you three?

529
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,400
Winter General and the Summer Fairy are also part of it.

530
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,780
So any old dog or cow is included.

531
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,170
There's no cow but there is a dog.

532
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,830
Secretary Ma got an invite too?!

533
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,620
If a dog is there, then it's practically the same as the cow being there, too!

534
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,080
She said she has to consult with us about the possessed corpse.

535
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,130
Sure. Have lots of discussions.

536
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,580
Shall I add you?

537
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,340
No way. Why would I join such an annoying chat group?

538
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm the Great Sage, the equal of heaven. Don't even think about adding me there.

539
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,640
I'm back.

540
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,570
Didn't she come together with Sam Jang?

541
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,230
She left already. Take a seat.

542
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,970
Hyungnim, shouldn't you go and see her?

543
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,740
Why would I go see her? I've no business with her.

544
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,760
Hyungnim, doesn't the zombie look clean now?

545
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,370
We did some work on her at Sam Jang's request.

546
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,890
Thanks to them all, I don't stink anymore.

547
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,610
Sa Oh Jeong, isn't the name we gave her pretty good?

548
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,520
Yes. You picked a fun one.

549
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,290
Thank you for giving me a name.

550
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,030
She has a name now? What is it?

551
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,200
I told you. In the group chat.

552
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,070
He's not in the group chat.

553
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,740
What?

554
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,730
Sam Jang didn't invite him, huh?

555
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,170
Shall I add you?

556
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:02,880
How dare you try to invite me? Don't add me. Add me and you die.

557
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,760
Don't mind me and just check your phones.

558
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,650
Hurry.

559
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,420
That ... that is, Summer Fairy uploaded a funny story.

560
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,810
It was funny, Sa Oh Jeong!

561
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:38,270
You should have agreed with me there.

562
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,120
You have no common sense!

563
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,590
Gosh. I'm speechless.

[Death From Losing Weight, "Anorexia"]

569
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:27,820
Two young girls who recently died from anorexia were both members here.

570
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,690
Just as I thought, is what I saw today actually really dangerous?

571
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,390
Do I need to go there again?

572
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,910
Going alone is kind of scary.

573
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,610
I lose weight even if I eat so much like this. This is so great!

574
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,930
Yum!

575
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,400
[To: Han Byeol, PK]

576
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,580
Thank you, CEO. My daughter really loves PK.

577
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,740
If you need anything else, tell me anytime.

578
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:23,050
Then, the next time you do an event with PK,

579
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,310
can my daughter come along with you to watch?

580
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,440
I'm sorry but it's a private event that can't be made public.

581
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,690
I guess it must be some kind of secret party stage that only really special people can attend then.

582
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,250
Yes, it's seriously special.

583
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,560
Just getting autographs is good enough for me.

584
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,460
My daughter will love these.

585
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,980
Oh, these...

586
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,090
This picture isn't for me. It's for my wife.

587
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:01,180
My wife asked me to print these using the company's color printer so I have them.

588
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,700
I keep on losing weight. I can keep eating.

589
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,930
Whipped cream.

590
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,050
It's a picture stimulator for dieting.

591
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:13,630
My wife sticks them in front of the scale.

592
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,250
Diet stimulator?

593
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,520
She sticks these pictures and whenever she weighs herself, she gets angry, annoyed, then sighs

594
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,600
and gets really stressed out.

595
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,890
Sounds great. If I get to work with Lucifer Entertainment, it'll be a great honor.

596
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,110
You're extremely skinny. You're not suffering from some kind of eating disorder, are you?

597
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,410
Even though I eat, I don't gain weight.

598
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,360
How could that be possible?

599
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,270
Are you taking drugs or getting surgeries done on yourself?

600
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:47,410
No, no! To tell the truth, I got a diet tattoo from someone my friend introduced me to.

601
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,880
It might just be a psychological thing, but I really don't gain weight anymore.

602
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,960
Just as Sam Jang suspected, it's a glutton.

603
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,040
It lives off of a tattoo on their bodies.

604
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,470
Then we just need to get rid of the tattoo on her.

605
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,270
This girl isn't the only one in danger.

606
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,120
There must be an evil spirit that is spreading the gluttons by making those tattoos.

607
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,080
If we don't get rid of it, the gluttons will continue to spread.

608
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,880
So we need to find the evil spirit who is drawing those tattoos.

609
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,110
From now on, you will need to find it.

610
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,500
M-Me?

611
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,560
That evil spirit approaches people by recognizing current society's strong desire to not gain weight.

612
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,930
We've never had such a desire

613
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,170
so it will not approach us.

614
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,180
So you will need to do it.

615
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,700
But I've never had that kind of desire before either.

616
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,240
Why are you being like this?

617
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,880
I've only thought that for my health's sake, it's not good to gain weight.

618
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,890
Are you kidding?

619
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:54,760
Will you keep this up?

620
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:03,200
All right. What does Gluttonous Lump have to do?

621
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,660
What the? Why is it so cold inside the house?

622
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,730
All of the boilers are turned off.

623
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,920
Air conditioner? Who the heck turns on the air conditioner in the middle of winte— was it you?

624
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Since it was too warm, I turned the air conditioning on.

625
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,060
Winter General told me I have to stay in a crunch, thin ice mode to keep my body from rotting.

626
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,160
Is my house a kimchi fridge?

627
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,690
I can't bear the cold at all. Hurry and turn the boiler on and the air conditioner off!

628
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,610
Just give it here.

629
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,310
Then what about me?

630
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,130
I will rot and smell.

Hey. Allowing a girl that's supposed to be in a coffin to stay in a fridge instead

633
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,050
- is giving you a life of luxury.
- Yes.

634
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,070
You there, Zombie. Did you buy yourself a phone?

635

Sa Oh Jeong-nim gave it to me.

636

In all my life, I've never seen a zombie as luxurious as you.

[Unni Sam Jang: A glutton appeared at Club Heaven!!]

Are you going to go to Unni?

652
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,700
Forget it. I didn't even get an invitation.

653
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,390
Your name is Bu Ja?

654
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,910
Yes. Since I have Unni's blood in me I'm taking her last name.

655
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,910
So my full name is Jin Bu Ja.

656
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:14,070
Hey, you're my minion since I'm the one who woke you up.

657
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,100
I'm the one who sent Sam Jang's blood flying. Me!

658
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,690
I heard. Coincidentally Unni called your name on the mountain

659
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,820
where I woke up from the dead.

660
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:34,010
Then instead of Jin Bu Ja,

661
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,240
- should I go by the name Son Bu Ja?
- Son Bu Ja?

662
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,140
No, stick with Jin Bu Ja.

663
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,810
Thank you.

664
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,920
Regardless, Unni is the most special to me, so I preferred Jin Bu Ja, too.

665
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,100
I only said that because I don't like the sound of Son Bu Ja.

666
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,120
I bet Sam Jang must be happy as a lark to have her own special Jin Bu Ja.

667
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,210
But you are the most special person to her.

Stop kidding, I didn't even get invited to the group chat.

For me, I've got KakaoTalk

670

but you have your own one-to-one direct line with her.

671
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,220
With that, she can call you directly, one-to-one.

672
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,590
You're right. There's no reason be invited to the group chat.

673
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,830
Since we have a special one-to-one bond.

She calls people well on that group chat,

677
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,220
yet why won't she call me directly?

686
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,470
- Is that so?
- But every time I see you...

687

You seem to keep getting thinner and thinner.

I'm very jealous.

691
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,720
Should I make that happen for you?

692
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,550
That must be the glutton Sam Jang is after.

693
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,270
I hear there's a bug on your tattoo.

694

Are you hitting on me right now?

695
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,110
No, it's just that there's a bug on you.

696
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,690
So where is this so-called bug?

697
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,750
Right here.

698
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,720
I ate all that food but why do I feel so low in energy?

699
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,710
That's because all this time you weren't the one that was eating.

700
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,060
Woah, woah. Get a hold of yourself.

701
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,340

In the meantime, that glutton attached itself to you.

708
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,720
I figured out where the evil spirit spreading the gluttons is.

709
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,260
Let's get the glutton that's on you off first.

710
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,170
Wait! You really don't need to get rid of him right now though.

711
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,190
Let me eat just a little longer.

712
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,690
Let me eat as much as I want while I can do so without gaining weight.

713
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,740
Until when?

714
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,580
Let me eat as much I want for just one week and then get rid of him.

715
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,380
Just 3 days then. After 3 days I'll be sure to let you get rid of him.

716

This is the business card of the tattoo artist.

Yes. It's the tattoo I gave the members here in exchange for money.

Do you think that giving diet tattoos is fraud?

732

I acknowledge that it is a lie.

733
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,920
Still, perhaps due to a placebo effect, there were many people who really lost weight.

Why are you treating it with medicine? Treat it with magic!

788
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,640
Just like before, go swish-swoosh and make it heal right up.

789
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,530
Do you think going swish-swoosh to heal it is that easy?

790
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:23,020
What I did earlier was super tiring, you know.

791
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,020
You go around boasting about being the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, but you're nothing much after all.

792
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,070
Since you are such an amazing person, I couldn't just call you.

793
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,420
You couldn't just call me?

794
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,910
That means you wanted to, right?

795
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,000
You wanted to see me?

796
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,960
If you missed me that much, why did you hold back?

797
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,720
I'm not saying I wanted to see you, I'm saying I felt burdened.

798
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,000
You are the Great Sage, and I'm a human who doesn't amount to much.

799
01:05:55,030 --> 01:06:00,060
And I'm sorry for using Geumganggo to tie you down.

800
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,290
Oh? "If you're sorry, take this off!" is what I thought you would say, but you're not saying anything?

801
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:19,440
Because even if you don't remove it, it's definitely going to come off. Someday.

802
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:25,840
Until then, I will love you without any burden on my heart.

803
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,450
This love that's bound to end and disappear without a trace...

804
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,990
I'm just going to pour it onto you like crazy.

805
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,770
End and disappear?

806
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:46,050
Of course. My feelings are fake after all.

807
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,480
I'll be done and you'll be alone again.

808
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,570
Until then, I'll be by your side.

809
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,830
I love you, Jin Seon Mi.

810
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,850
Hey Bu Ja, you should be eating sacrificial offerings right now,

811
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,060
but you're eating our Oh Jeong's homemade food.

812
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,830
You're really living the good life.

813
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,240
I really am.

814
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,400
I'm really curious if I got to eat good food like this when I was alive, too.

815
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,860
Bu Ja, did you sleep in the fridge last night?

816
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,610
It stinks a bit again.

817
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm trying to keep my temperature down, but Son Oh Gong kept turning up the boiler so I had to.

818
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,950
Hey, the girl is rotting. Turn the boiler down.

819
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:53,740
I was born from a volcano. Have you any idea how cold it is in here for me right now?

820
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,120
If you have such a problem with it, then you can find a room and leave. Turn up the boiler there!

821
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,570
Why should I?

822
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,610
Hey, Bu Ja. Forget about that crunch, thin ice mode business

823
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,510
and just go in the fridge over there and freeze yourself nice and hard.

824
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:12,700
When spring comes and the weather warms, I'll take you out to thaw. All good now?

825
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:20,390
Good grief, this cold-hearted nut job...

826
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:25,690
Bu Ja, you'll melt if you cry. Don't cry, okay?

827
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,520
What'd I do? What?

828

No. I mean, I'll just—

He said it's noisy and to not invite him.

Oh, he did? I shouldn't invite you?

840
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,650
No, I mean I dislike it. It's noisy, so of course I hate it.

But if you really want to add me...

I got it. I won't invite you.

Hyungnim, do you want more salad?

No! Forget it! I definitely won't eat it.

Very well, I definitely won't give you any.

Now that I've seen it, being worthy of the great protection of the Great Sage, the equal of heaven,

941
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:41,060
is how incredibly important of a person I actually am.

942
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,620
That's quite some honor.

943
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:48,020
- You are awfully strong, right?
- Yes.

944
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:55,390
No matter what happens to me, you'll always stay beside me, right?

945
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,470
That's what I keep saying.

946
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:01,950
Then that's enough.

947
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,320
Then I can do it.

948
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:22,790
Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, protect me until the end.

949
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,990
♫ When I saw you ♫

950
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:38,620
♫ I think only about you ♫

951
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:41,400
♫ When I love you ♫

952
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:49,290
Alright. Even if the world falls apart,

953
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,150
I'll protect you.

954
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:56,070
♫ I will ♫

955
01:21:56,070 --> 01:22:01,510
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

956
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:05,730
♫ Can I go back ♫

957
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:08,980
♫ When I saw you ♫

958
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,600
♫ Always behind of you ♫

959
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,960
♫ Always behind of you ♫

960
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,290
[Hwayugi]

961
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:34,040
Who do you think you're trying to fool with the innocent act?

962
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,430
- Because I love you.
- I should love you.

963
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:38,770
What are you doing? Making my heart flutter... Oh, "love-love."

964
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:42,240
I feel like the you who tells me you love me is going to make me end up loving you too.

965
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,550
We may never know what kinds of scandalous secrets some people may be hiding.

966
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:48,770
- What is this?!
- It was you.

967
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:52,030
If you're in a dangerous situation, call for Son Oh Gong.

968
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:56,030
- Son Oh Gong.
- Jin Seon Mi! Open your eyes! I said open them!

969
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,850
This can't happen.

970
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,470
Jin Seon Mi!
