And now...

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,120
I'm going to end your love.

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,380
♫ It was probably destiny ♫

7
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,590
♫ It was probably pre-destined ♫

I don't want to take this off.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,150
I want to keep loving you.

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,370
This is of my own free will.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,530
We have a destined fate.

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,640
I heard the ringing of a love bell.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,930
Do you want to marry me?

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,230
Then you can't run away from me, even if you take off the Geumganggo.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,080
Jin Seon Mi, hold onto me even tighter.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,140
Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, protect me until the end.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,400
I think I'm crazily in love with you right now.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,070
- Why would you miss me?
- Because I love you this annoyingly!

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,240
I love you, Jin Seon Mi.

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,950
- What is this?!
- Geumganggo.

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,620
You came to save me?

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,570
No. I came to eat you.

25
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,250
By chance, were you still looking for me?

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,370
You finally appear now, Fairy?

27
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,760
If you call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger,

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,370
I will always appear and protect you.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,500
If we, who have been intertwined through the Geumganggo, are in a fatal relationship,

30

then run away from me again, Son Oh Gong.

This baby's blood will save people.

What you're seeing right now is the birth of Sam Jang.

34
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,310
So you're the guardian who will protect Sam Jang this time.

35
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,460
I wanted to show you the beginning of a new Sam Jang.

36
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,720
Since I want you to protect this child until the end.

Don't ever let go.

38
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,030
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to remove the Geumganggo.

39
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,320
I said I won't remove it.

Oh. A white heron has visited Suruemdong...

- Don't do it.
- I will do it.

46

Why? Are you afraid you'll kill me?

47
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,140
Yes. I can't protect you any other way.

48
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,690
So you laid inside the coffin with the lid closed? Are you an idiot?

49
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes. I am an idiot. You jerk!

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,660
I didn't do that.

51
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,620
Did I?

52
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,750
I did this?

53
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,100
No matter how angry I was, would I have broken these?

54
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,350
Only the valuable ones were broken.

55
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,800
I have this kind of power?

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,680
Since when?

57
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,950
When Ah Sa Nyeo went in and out your body,

58
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,610
did she leave some of her powers behind?

59
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,590
Did she?

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,990
I mean, I do remember everything that happened while she was in my body.

61
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,630
She didn't drink any wine here and you didn't light the candles, right?

62
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,250
That's right. You remember everything!

63
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,140
Also...

64
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,060
- She took the drug.
- That's ri—

65
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,280
No.

66
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,850
It's true, but it's not like that.

Whoa. You're cool! You're cool!

69
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,930
Yeah. I think I've become a bit cooler.

70
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,220
She took my power...

71
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,960
Oh Jeong worked hard to prepare this, and it's become a mess.

72
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,660
I know. He decorated it prettily.

73
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,670
It's a shame.

74
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,380
You know...

75
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,340
it turns out we aren't a match made in heaven.

76
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,900
That bell... was a death bell.

77
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Coming back to see you was too scary and painful for me.

78
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,260
Even now?

79
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,340
I know what kind of mindset you had when you were trying not to come out of there.

80
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,130
I wanted to protect you in the way that I could.

81
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,460
Since I had no power of any kind.

82
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,090
What do you mean you have no power? You're Sam Jang.

83
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,900
Since you're Sam Jang, you're special and are able to kill the great me.

84
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,790
From now on, I'm going to be on alert while figuring out how you might be able to kill me.

85
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,220
And I'm going to avoid it well so that I don't die.

86
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,460
So don't be scared.

87
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay. Don't ever die because of me.

88
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,730
Right now, I feel like I'm going to die because of you.

89
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,990
Ending my first night with you just sleeping, it's so unfair I could die.

90
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,850
You smiling like that, you're too adorable.

91
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,430
Huh? Stop smiling. It's really killing me.

92
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,860
This won't do.

93
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,900
If I stay here with you, I'll die from anxiety.

94
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,980
I'll take you home. Come.

95
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,200
I wonder how I broke this.

96
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,310
Has Sam Jang left?

97
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,840
Yeah. What are you doing here?

98
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,570
I was looking around the garden because I was here anyway to drop off your meal.

99
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,210
If you brought food, you should bring it in. Why are you pulling out weeds?

100
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,370
There isn't even much grass.

101
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,520
But it seemed like I shouldn't come in.

102
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,810
Nothing happened that you shouldn't come in.

103
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,460
Since you're here, clean the room in Sureumdong.

104
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,110
Yes. I will clean it.

105
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:30,310
By the way, Hyungnim, a white heron came by Sureumdong.

106
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,130
- A white heron?
- Yes.

107
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,820
It came into Sureumdong?

108
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,710
Then it can't be an ordinary winged animal.

109
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,660
Probably not.

110
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,140
It's the birth of Sam Jang.

111
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,180
The one that showed me something like that earlier...

112
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,490
was it that thing?

113
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,880
What did you see?

114
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,900
Oh. She said it was the birth of Sam Jang.

115
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,590
But it's strange.

116
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,260
I was told that she became Sam Jang as a punishment for freeing me.

117
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,590
But what's the birth about?

118
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,530
Just as you heard, she must have been Sam Jang since birth.

119
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,750
Then it's even stranger.

120
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,190
You said it was a white heron...

121
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,220
What exactly did it show me?

122
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I hear a baby's cry.

123
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,500
That's right. I heard a baby's cry a moment ago.

124
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,870
I really hear it.

125
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,270
It's a real baby.

126
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,600
The white heron must have brought it.

127
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,860
In just one night,

128
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,640
you had a baby?

129
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,770
I told you that's not it.

130
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,150
The white heron left it in the Suremdong garden.

131
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,620
But the thing is, this baby...

132
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,000
Why does it resemble you?

133
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,770
Does that make sense? How could that happen in one night?

134
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,690
And yesterday, because of the drug I shared with Ah Sa Nyeo, I slept the whole time.

135
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,730
Oh, that's right. What happened to her?

136
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,370
Ah, I lost Ah Sa Nyeo.

137
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,610
You lost her? You did? How did that happen?

138
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,550
I've gotten weaker.

139
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,610
It's that bad?

140
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,540
That's right. And I still have side effects.

141
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,980
I've been struck by a chill, too. Oh, so cold!

142
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,480
Now I'm a bull without horns.

143
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,030
I'll catch her. Ma Wang, go rest until your horns grow back.

144
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,460
They'll grow back, so don't worry.

145
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,480
Whoa, the baby. Hey, you need to take the baby!

146
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,600
What am I supposed to do with this child?

147
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,940
He always brings bothersome things and leaves them with me.

148
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,650
Ah, seriously!

149
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,340
If Son Oh Gong catches Ah Sa Nyeo, he'll find out that you let her go on purpose.

150
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,180
Do you think the child Princess Iron Fan gave birth to really died?

151
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,540
Until I find out whether Ah Sa Nyeo is telling the truth or not, I'm going to keep her alive.

152
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,210
That cunning thing created a seed of useless doubt in your mind.

153
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,440
The suspicion could become real.

154
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,960
Even if small, there's still a chance that the child could still be alive.

155
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,040
Until my suspicions are resolved, I won't trust anyone.

156
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,370
Even the Great Sage?

157
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,670
That's right, even that guy.

158
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,170
I have to be suspicious of everything.

159
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,010
You, too...

160
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,390
Did you come to deceive me?

161
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,140
You dare try to bewitch me with that face?

162
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,580
You have no chance.

163
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,990
I'm Ma Wang!

164
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,550
Peek-a-boo! Aigoo, you're holding my hand?

165
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,360
Hey, Secretary Ma, go buy a rattle. I'm going to do whatever he wants.

166
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,740
Aigoo, you're smiling. Aigoo, is that so?

167
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,860
What are you doing? Hurry up and go buy it!

168
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,660
Aigoo, you're so cute. Even your hand is cute. Aigoo, you're smiling.

169
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,330
How long do I have to wait?

170
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,310
I think we need to talk.

171
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,500
There are a lot of things I'm curious about.

172
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,020
What are you curious about?

173
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,870
About what you are and what you can do.

174
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,240
There are a lot of things I want to know.

175
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,740
If I were to tell you about all of that, it would be tiring.

176
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,530
Should I take care of the thing that the kid next to you is worried about?

177
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:08,290
She says she needs to get rid of the person who knows about Akiko.

178
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,500
[Ceramic ware, Potter Craftmanship meet]

179
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,060
For helping in keeping our family matters from leaking out to the public,

180
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm thankful for that.

181
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,510
Your great-grandfather whom we thought was an independence fighter

182
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,190
received a Medal of Honor from the Emperor of Japan.

183
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,820
I was shocked as well.

184
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,230
I don't know anything.

185
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,040
It's comfortable to have buried history.

186
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,680
Just promise me that I will have a definite position.

187
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,640
When you enter politics,

188
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,810
if your family's pro-Japanese past is revealed,

189
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,010
then it will become an obstacle.

190
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,420
Obstacles should be removed.

191
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,630
Let's talk over a cup of tea.

192
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,550
I have an artifact to show you as well.

193
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,210
This was discovered at a construction site.

194
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,480
It's an old sarcophagus.

195
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,960
About what I am and what I can do for you...

196
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,470
have I answered it somewhat?

197
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,550
You take care of the clean-up. I'll be leaving.

198
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:02,360
Ah Sa Nyeo's sarcophagus was uncovered on the land owned by the Korean Foundation belonging to Kang Dae Seong.

199
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,030
He must have her coffin. Then would she have gone there?

200
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,270
Kang Dae Seong is not an ordinary person.

201
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,930
It's believed that he will be the country's top personage in a few years.

202
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,380
Okay.

203
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:24,680
Even in this world, I'm going to call a dragon again.

204
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,470
And by doing so, I'll crown a king.

205
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,320
She said that when she was in Sam Jang's body.

206
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,800
Did she choose that person?

207
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,710
Anyway, there's a good chance that she's near that person.

208
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,730
It's a notification from the group chat.

209
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,350
There weren't any chats going on lately though. Huh?

210
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,530
- What is it?
- Bu Ja has sent a greeting to the group chat.

211
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,260
What?

212
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,450
Hi, everyone.

213
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,900
Hi? What kind of nonsense is this?

214
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,650
Aigoo, you're so pretty. You're so pretty.

215
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,130
A text message has arrived.

216
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,500
Wait a moment.

217
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
Hi, everyone.

218
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,930
Even if I don't introduce myself, I'm sure you know who I am.

219
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:32,630
Her mental state passes. It's quite strong.

220
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,780
But still, for those who might be confused, I am Ah Sa Nyeo.

221
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,030
I don't think she's normal.

222
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,800
If you know where Son Oh Gong is, message me.

223
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,200
If not, tell him where I am.

224
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,650
If this thing is calling me out, then she has something she's counting on.

225
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,170
[If you know where Son Oh Gong is, message me.]

226
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,100
Evil wench.

227
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,000
The wind... where did it suddenly blow from?

228
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,810
The wind?
(The Korean word for two-timer and wind sound the same)

229
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:34,350
CEO, are you going to meet Secretary Son?

230
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,420
Yes, I plan to.

231
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,110
Um, CEO, it's because I just can't stop myself from asking and wondering,

232
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,350
but the people close to Secretary Son...

233
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,840
are they involved in making these kinds of things?

234
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,100
So you saw. A person close to him is connected to it.

235
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,260
No wonder. No wonder.

236
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,680
I thought our Secretary Son was unusually glitzy.

237
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,540
CEO, you're really amazing.

238
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,290
I salute you! I truly salute you! You even got a ring.

239
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,200
Then are you now going to become a part of a chaebol family?

240
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,390
Oh, you don't have the ring.

241
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,370
Ah, he took it off.

242
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,640
Then on the night you were dragged off,

243
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,540
did you get handed an envelope of money

244
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,680
and slapped with a glass of water like this?

245
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,410
Is there a lot of opposition?

246
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:43,240
Yes. The opposition from up there is really severe.

247
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,240
- You're not going?
- Yes, I don't think I need to go. Go back to work.

248
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,070
This can't be a good place to die.

249
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,870
This is a good place for a date.

250
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,830
I found it while surfing the web.

251
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,360
It's really convenient these days.

252
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,200
Yes, then just conveniently surf the web and do some shopping, too.

253
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,330
Input "coffin" in the search bar. A coffin.

254
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,850
Or do you want to reuse your coffin again?

255
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,100
I guess you're not in the mood for a date.

256
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,960
If I had known, when we were together that time,

257
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,540
I would've drank the wine and had you light the candles.

258
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,120
Then even the moment I took the drug would've been romantic.

259
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,910
I'll put scented candles and wine in your coffin.

260
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,380
You shouldn't be like this to me.

261
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,340
Sam Jang will be in danger.

262
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,360
When I was in Sam Jang's body, I ate something dangerous.

263
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,970
What dangerous thing?!

264
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,970
Hey! That day, you had a bowl of ox head rice soup,

265
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,450
two hoddeoks (pancake stuffed with brown sugar) that Lee Han Joo bought at the market, and an ice cream.

266
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,820
I told you I was watching you.

267
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,210
I guess you wouldn't know of Yook Gong's presence.

268
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,740
Why? Is that what you were counting on?

269
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,630
How disappointing.

270
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,340
I won't lay a finger on Sam Jang ever again.

271
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,580
So that you can't lay a finger on Sam Jang again, I'll put you in your coffin.

272
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,550
Stop trying to play around. Let's go.

273
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,510
Ma Wang is the one who let me go.

274
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,410
I promised to help him.

275
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,340
You said Ma Wang let you go?

276
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,140
Yes. I let her go.

277
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,850
So you let her go this time too.

278
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,560
So Ma Wang was the one you were actually counting on?

279
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,940
This one seems more plausible.

280
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,870
I said I would rip her to shreds and kill her.

281
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,440
I'm keeping her alive because she is useful.

282
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,200
If she is of no use, I will catch her and hand her over to you.

283
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,640
Fine. Let me hear what you have to say.

284
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,650
See you next time.

285
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,190
Just so you know, you won't be able to get out of paying this time either.

286
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,350
Dine and dash accordingly.

287
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,090
Ma Wang, please pay for...

288
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,880
I've been deceived all this time. Being obedient like a dog.

289
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,910
I realized they could be using me.

290
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,530
I think Ah Sa Nyeo is deceiving you with her stupid talk.

291
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,130
In order to tame me into submission,

292
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,460
the heavens deceived me about my child and said nonsensical stuff.

293
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,280
Ah Sa Nyeo is the one speaking nonsense to use you!

294
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,680
My child is alive but they hid him from me.

295
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,830
You've watched too many dramas.

296
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,830
The child lived but did they kill him?

297
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,380
It went from a melodrama to a thriller?

298
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,090
I must avenge my son.

299
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,240
Ma Wang, give it a rest!

300
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,390
Why? I don't know whether my son is alive or dead.

301
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,480
So why should I calm down?

302
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,660
The baby's waking up. You guys argue quietly.

303
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,570
The more I think about it, the more I'm suspicious.

304
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,660
First of all, whether or not Princess Iron Fan saved the child hasn't even been confirmed yet!

305
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,880
They can't fool you unless the child was saved!

306
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,820
Shush!

307
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,440
So I'm going to order Ah Sa Nyeo to confirm it.

308
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
Aigoo, of course.

309
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,970
Ah Sa Nyeo has really bewitched you with that baby talk.

310
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,470
You think you'd be any different?

311
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,120
It's about a child. A child!

312
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,930
What's so great about a child, huh?

313
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,450
Let's see. Hey, peek-a-boo.

314
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,140
Are you laughing at me?

315
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,580
Hey, hey. Do peek-a-boo one more time.

316
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,170
Why should I?

317
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,270
The baby stopped crying. Do peek-a-boo once more.

Do you know anything about Jin Seon Mi's early years by any chance?

When you put her in the Five Elements Mountain, how did you find her and put her in there?

Oh no. I found her while looking for special humans.

- Jin Seon Mi was?

That's why Jonathan is trying to make a movie about her, too.

Have you not seen the news article on Wooja?

Wooja was based on Seon Mi's life.

362
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,760
A long time ago, a mysterious epidemic wiped out an entire village.

363
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,020
Amongst those who died was a pregnant woman who,

364
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,350
just before she died, gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

365

That girl was Seon Mi.

She was scorned and ostracized by everyone around her

477
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,960
You're going to get it back?

478
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,930
Of course you should.

479
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,330
Should I make you some premium coffee perhaps?

480
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,450
Never mind that. Just watch the kid.

481
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,130
If he cries, you just need to do peek-a-boo. Only if he cries.

482
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,040
Ah, what a relief.

483
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,660
Since I found the ring for you, compensate me.

484
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,860
It's not like you did anything.

485
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,000
My grandmother is coming back.

486
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,900
I need to put back all the money I took before then.

487
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,100
Where has she gone away to for so long?

488
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,990
I don't know. She said she was going to look for a sword.

489
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,080
A sword? What kind of sword takes that long to find?

490
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
I know.

491
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,520
It's since the day that Noona came here and the ill omen jar broke, so...

492
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,530
It's been quite awhile. It must be a very important item.

493
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,670
An ill omen jar...

494
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,790
I saw the world getting destroyed.

495
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,240
She saw that here, right?

496
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,930
The Geumganggo came from here also.

497
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,370
And what is this about a sword?

498
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,410
Hey, contact me first when your grandmother returns.

499
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,390
Okay.

500
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,990
Really, I give you credit for your mental strength and guts.

501
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,110
You even came here without being called.

502
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,920
Since you're my backer.

503
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,900
If you really want to keep me as your backer,

504
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,580
then find me proof that what you told me is true.

505
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,820
Since you won't believe my words, I'll find you proof that you can believe.

506
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,260
Give me a little time.

507
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,490
Whose baby is this?

508
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,100
It's not. He doesn't look like me at all, but how come everyone is constantly judging me?

509
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,980
Then why do you have this baby with you?

510
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,370
I'm going to return the baby now.

511
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,000
- Let's go together.
- Where is it?

512
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,050
Where you were born.

513
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,470
- Why there?
- Someone called.

514
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,270
Let's go and hear about your beginnings.

515
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,800
It might be that your fate was sealed even before we met.

516
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,380
Since you were born.

517
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,650
I was very unlucky since the day I was born.

518
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,710
My parents died as well as a lot of the villagers.

519
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,240
People were scared that I was an ominous kid and didn't like me.

520
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,380
My uncle avoids me for the same reason.

521
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,670
I know.

522
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,260
Let's go and find out again.

523
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,440
Whether Jin Seon Mi truly is an ominous child.

524
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,130
- This is—
- I know. It's where you were born.

525
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:49,040
And it's a place where my parents and a lot of villagers died.

526
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,430
Let's go in.

527
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,470
Thank you for safely bringing back the child.

528
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,870
You went through a lot, baby.

529
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:23,600
It's not time for you to be born yet, but I made you travel.

530
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,150
Jin Seon Mi, you've grown up a lot.

531
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,760
I was here, too, when you were born.

532
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,460
Pardon? But you look so young...

533
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:45,640
You're not human, are you?

534
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,970
That's right. The one who called for me to come here with you is her.

535
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,430
I'm a white heron.

536
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,530
Do you know me?

537
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,700
I know your grandmother well.

538
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,970
She treasured her special granddaughter a lot.

539
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,110
Really?

540
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,700
But what's the reason you called me here?

541
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,560
I wanted to let you know that you're not an ominous child at all.

542
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,480
The infectious disease that suddenly appeared spread like wildfire.

543
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:33,840
Since it was a small village, this place overflowed with patients.

544
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,980
Those who got infected died very quickly.

545
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,550
The place was quarantined.

546
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,730
There was a pregnant woman close to her due date among the patients.

547
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,190
I felt it since the moment that mother stepped in here.

548
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,700
The baby that would save people would be born.

549
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,360
The mother died but the baby was born safely.

550
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,550
And the blood of that baby saved others.

551
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,790
The disease disappeared in an instant.

552
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,910
No one knows this truth.

553
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,240
But you saved people since the moment you were born.

554
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,260
Sam Jang.

555
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,750
I saved them?

556
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,430
Your fate was sealed since you were born.

557
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,910
Of course, the lotus scent of your blood probably started

558
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,400
after you met your guardian.

559
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,100
But... how do you know all this?

560
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,340
Since a long time ago,

561
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,720
I had been waiting for Sam Jang to be born.

562
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,860
Thank you for telling me.

563
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,030
I was an ominous child,

564
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,920
so I was worried everyone around me would be harmed.

565
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,760
But since you're telling me that's not true, it's comforting.

566
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,240
Whatever you go through in the future,

567
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,760
it'll probably result in saving, not harming.

568
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,940
Thank you for bringing her here.

569
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,950
I've never walked on this road feeling happy.

570
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,530
I was always alone.

571
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,940
If not, the kids used to throw rocks at me.

572
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,970
Are you happy now?

573
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,740
First of all, my fate isn't your fault.

574
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,880
Then no matter what happens to me, it's not your fault, so I'm happy.

575
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,270
You're not scared anymore?

576
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,410
No. I feel like I'm a bit greater than I thought,

577
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,540
and I'm less scared because I have powers.

578
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,290
When I become stronger, I won't be scared. Like you.

579
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,060
When did I say I wasn't scared?

580
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,880
I feel like I'm going to die out of fright because of you.

581
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,800
You said I was your only weakness, right?

582
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,410
I don't like that.

583
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,160
I'm going to become much stronger

584
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,760
and take this off for you.

585
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,590
If I'm not pretty at all after I take this off, then run away.

586
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:40,140
But if I'm even a little bit pretty, I'll hold onto you tightly then.

587
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,290
Let's go.

588
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,950
But I guess my grandma knew you'd come.

589
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:02,840
When I talked about the fairy, she always told me he'd be back.

590
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,280
That doctor said your grandma was close to her, right?

591
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,740
Yeah.

592
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:20,530
Son Oh Gong, I'm sure there are things you're still curious about.

593
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,500
I'm sorry. You should have gone home first.

594
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,990
No, it's okay. I was about to leave.

595
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:41,380
- Huh? You found it.
- What?

596
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,070
The ring.

597
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,480
Secretary Son gave it back to you, didn't he?

598
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,870
You see, I told him off earlier.

599
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:55,160
No matter how strong the opposition is, you have to push through it with love!

600
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,890
Let's go!

601
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,090
Let's go.

602
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,230
He gave it back to me then...

603
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,960
You came back.

604
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:41,030
Since I didn't get to hear anything you wanted to tell me.

605
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,880
You're right. I have something to tell you.

606
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,900
- Since you're Sam Jang's guardian.
- What are you exactly?

607
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,860
Like you, I'm also a guardian who used to protect the last Sam Jang.

608
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,290
Before the disarrangement of the world comes, they said Sam Jang would appear.

609
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,090
I'm sure Jin Seon Mi isn't the first. What else?

610
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,430
Soon, a sword will appear.

611
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:14,180
With that sword, you'll end up stabbing Sam Jang.

612
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:20,990
Just like how I did a long time ago.

613

614
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,500
[Kang Dae Seong announces his plans to enter into politics]

615
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,830
An enormous evil spirit, which the world's wickedness created, will appear.

616
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,260
Sam Jang will receive it with her body.

617
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,620
- That's the end of Sam Jang's summons.
- And then what happens?

618
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,680
Your job is to kill Sam Jang along with the evil spirit with the sword issued to you

619
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,910
and end the world's disarrangement.

620
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,830
Because that's how it has been decided to play out,

621
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,520
the death bell rang.

622
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,110
What's the reason you called me to tell me this?

623
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,760
I have something to request of you.

624
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,450
When the sword is given to you, help me so that I can die.

625
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:44,500
Without that, it's too painful for me to endure this long life alone.

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,570
Thanks to you, an obstacle on my path has disappeared.

635
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,280
There are more things I can do.

636
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,050
Among those things you can do, by chance...

637
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:55,390
does it include calling a dragon to crown a king?

638
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:02,380
So you... want to become a king.

639
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:08,780
Then first, there's someone you have to meet.

640
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,160
Who?

641
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,040
There's a woman whose strength we need

642
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,540
in order to fulfill your wish. Make her yours.

643
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,830
Then I will have to meet her.

644
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,120
You will see her soon.

645
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,150
You said you looked after Jeong Se Ra's mother, right?

646
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm helping her since she's in need.

647
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,460
Since I made the mistake, I have to take good care of her.

648
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,950
Helping the mother of a woman you killed...

649
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,130
You'll surely become a wicked king.

650
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,340
This girl's mother...

651
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,270
You're not happy to see me anymore?

652
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,230
I don't want to have awful thoughts when I see you. I don't want to see you anymore.

653
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,340
Jeo Pal Gye, I went and saw her mom.

654
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,560
Don't listen to her. Let's go, Pig.

655
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,930
Thanks to you, I fulfilled this girl's desperate wish.

656
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,170
Thank you.

657
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,910
You're trying to use me again?

658
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,450
Yes.

659
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,690
I have a request.

660
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,290
Let me meet Sam Jang.

661
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,260
You're really only meeting her for a second to talk to her, right?

662
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,760
If it becomes dangerous and the Great Sage comes, you're dead.

663
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,760
I know that too well.

664
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,220
I'm not the one who's going to meet her.

665
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,800
Then whom are you having her meet?

666
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,330
Are you okay?

667
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,070
Something seems wrong.

668
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,840
Yeah. I'm okay.

669
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:23,280
But... it's a little strange.

670
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,250
Oh, Grandma. You're back.

671
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,840
Yes. I was gone for too long, right?

672
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:41,890
What is it? You took that long looking for this?

673
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,940
It's for an important day.

674
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,600
The energy of the skies is strange today.

675
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,590
Those no good... They must be up to something.

676
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:09,400
Even if the heavens actually fooled you,

677
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,270
you mustn't act in haste.

678
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,000
You're currently in a state after losing a lot of power.

679
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,580
I know. I've become weaker, indeed.

680
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:26,250
I have no energy to go and turn everything upside down.

681
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,260
But, very simply,

682
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,300
I have a way to become stronger than before.

683
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,830
- What...
- Sam Jang.

684
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:39,650
If I eat her, that'll do it.

685
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,960
But... there's the Great Sage.

686
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,050
We just need to take off the Geumganggo.

687
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,690
Once we remove the Geumganggo I got for them,

688
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:55,330
we can remove him from Sam Jang's side.

689
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,330
If they fooled me for a thousand years,

690
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,750
what is there that I can't do?

691
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:17,020
Earlier, I saw the same thing that I saw when the ill omen jar broke.

692
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:22,040
To be honest, I see the future once in a while.

693
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,760
I guess you really are continuously becoming stronger.

694
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:30,480
It feels like something that's meant to happen is coming closer.

695
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,650
There's something I didn't tell you.

696
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,860
The doctor we met with,

697
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,440
she was a guardian of another Sam Jang a long ago. Like you and me.

698
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,440
Really? So what happened?

699
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,740
The two of them

700
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:56,030
did their jobs so well that they were greatly rewarded,

701
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,390
became deities, and are living happily ever after.

702
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,460
Wow. That's great.

703
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,110
Then I'll become a deity, too?

704
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,130
Becoming deity is not the problem.

705
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,950
Make sure you ask for what you want when the chance comes.

706
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:15,120
They told me they'd give me an official position but locked me up in the peach field.

707
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,360
The heavens are very cheap, you see.

708
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,140
Peach field?

709
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:22,360
Oh, the place where your popularity exploded among the fairies?

710
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,750
The group fight?

711
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,490
Let's forget about that.

712
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,130
Anyway, that's how we'll become.

713
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:39,190
Right. Let's become like that.

714
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,070
But if...

715
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:46,720
one disappears and one ends up alone,

716
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:51,180
I think the one left behind will be sadder.

717
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:59,200
It will be more painful as the time left to live is indefinitely long.

718
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:19,310
You don't want to live happily forever with me?

719
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,720
Well... someone who is unemployed and just plays around is a bit...

720
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,830
Should I tell Oh Jeong to keep a position open for me?

721
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:30,020
No. I have a lot of money. You just have fun.

722
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,190
Okay. I'll continue to have fun.

723
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,530
But for now, there's something I have to do.

724
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,620
I need some winning spirit.

725
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,610
When I'm scared, suffering, or in danger,

726
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,820
I'll call for Jin Seon Mi.

727
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,830
I'll be going.

728
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,230
It's the sword to be used on that day.

729
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,170
You've worked hard.

730
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:46,120
I've done my duty.

731
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,880
Finally, Sam Jang's sword has arrived!

732
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,080
The sword of Sam Jang is here with us again?

733
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,050
The disarrangement will soon appear.

734
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,780
Is that it?

735
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,810
This is—

736
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,320
Great Sage!

737
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,130
It's not something that you should have yet.

738
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,440
You're going to give it to me anyway.

739
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,980
- You knew?
- A white heron came by Sureumdong.

740
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,050
That sword can never be destroyed.

741
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:53,290
For her summons, Sam Jang will be sacrificed,

742
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:58,540
and if you, the Great Sage, carry that deed out using that sword, it will be done.

743
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,580
But don't worry.

744
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,290
The moment you have to use that sword, the Geumganggo will disappear,

745
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:12,940
and you will be able to stab Sam Jang without any pain.

746
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:17,460
After that, the painful punishment that was given to you

747
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,000
will all end.

748
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:25,390
Load of crap.

749
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:37,300
Now, the sword has been handed over to the guardian!

750
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,820
What is that punk going to do by taking that?

751
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,860
You found it.

752
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:11,550
Then please lend me that sword

753
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,900
so that I can die as promised.

754
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:23,490
You're wearing the Geumganggo.

755
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:32,270
Then... even if you're left behind like me in this world alone,

756
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,990
you will be able to escape from this suffering.

757
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,210
Because I'm wearing this,

758
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:43,640
what pain is like after it disappears,

759
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,870
how big it will be, I can't guess at it.

760
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:50,990
I'm more fearful of that.

761
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,510
Don't... end up like me.

762
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:58,170
I will never end up like that.

763
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,020
Now, I want to end this already.

764
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:42,460
If that sword is gone, will Sam Jang be safe?

765
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:47,870
Probably. But that sword will never disappear.

766
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,660
What if Son Oh Gong doesn't use that sword?

767
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,790
If he's to protect Sam Jang without that sword,

768
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:59,480
the Great Sage will have to put his life on the line.

769
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,030
The sword I have to use to kill Sam Jang...

770
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:27,970
Don't ever come back out into this world.
