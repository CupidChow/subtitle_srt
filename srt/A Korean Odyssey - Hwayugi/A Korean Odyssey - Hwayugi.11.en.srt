Of course. I have to follow and die as soon as possible.

121
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,220
After Ma Wang dies, should I also retire and die?

122
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,440
If you die, do you want to come with me and live at the dragon sea palace?

123
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,120
All the way below Dokdo, I have a vacation house. It's nice.

I plan to live until retirement and die afterwards.

126
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,760
But everyone, you've all lived a socially recognized life.

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,110
If you just die, won't humans be thrown into confusion?

128
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,980
Before, we could just disappear, but these days

129
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,840
because we leave many photos and documents behind,

130
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,620
it's a bit of a headache.

131
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,080
So why did you get famous without a plan and create an unnecessary dilemma? You should've just lazed around like me.

132
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,780
That's right. Here, it's only you.

133
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,860
You're the only one living with a plan as an unemployed, nut job of a thug who's a punk that's a playboy.

134
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,600
What's wrong with living as an unemployed, nut job of a thug who's a punk that's a playboy?

135
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,250
It's so convenient to live as a nut job.

136
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,340
If you become famous, you just complicate things for yourself!

137
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,820
If I'm going to live, I might as well receive respect from humans.

138
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,230
Don't you need to receive love to make it worth living?

139
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,360
I don't need such things. Respect and love.

140
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,250
I just need to receive them from Sam Jang.

141

Sam Jang, by chance?

142
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,700
No! It's definitely not!

143
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,480

Energy beads and preservatives have a limit.

At any given moment, you'll lose consciousness.

Then will Pal Gye try to capture a human again and get you to eat it?

208

That's not something he should do.

Then you'll really become a monster.

But if she has to capture and get rid of you after you've become a monster,

No. Why? Do you need a love bell?

No. I'm curious to know if the love bell can ring between a human and a demon.

Death bell?

Because Sam Jang snitched on me that day,

235
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,500
I lost the death bell because you chased me.

That's right. That day. You said you lost the death bell that day.

Zombie, you're so weak.

467
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,070
I don't want to become an evil spirit.

468
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,710
I don't need revenge.

469
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,490
I want to disappear while I'm still pretty like this.

470
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,100
All right. Do as you wish.

471
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Keep it a secret from everyone.

472
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,420
Just give me some time to say a nice farewell to them.

473
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,870
And you're cold so please turn on the boiler and turn off the air conditioner.

474
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,000
I'll sleep in the bathtub now.

475
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,330
Leave it, leave it. I'll clean it up.

476
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,050
I can throw them away in the bathtub, right? I'm going to toss them all out then.

477
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,160
The first man who was possessed by the evil spirit and stabbed you was a construction worker.

478
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,860
He worked at Professor Kang Dae Seong's Korea Foundation building construction site.

479
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,540
I will go there with Sam Jang.

480
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,190
I've got a bad feeling about this.

481
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,850
Well, she's got Son Oh Gong so I'm sure nothing much will happen but...

482
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:48,450
Ma Wang, there's something suspicious between Sam Jang and Son Oh Gong.

483
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,680
- What is it?
- Do you remember the peddler's grandson saying he lost the death bell?

484
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,500
Yeah, he did.

485
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,750
I believe that death bell fell into Sam Jang's hands.

486
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,670
The death bell is in Sam Jang's hands?

487
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,690
By any chance, did the death bell ring?

488
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,150
Yes.

489
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,860
I think Sam Jang still doesn't know what it actually is.

490
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,390
Damn it...

491
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,660
Did Secretary Ma figure out that I have the love bell?

492
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,450
Should I take it to her and ask if it's the real deal?

493
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,050
I'm going to your side right now. Count to ten.

494
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,960
You're here? What's the occasion?

495
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,740
You even sent a text in advance.

496
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,470
I decided to go easy on you in many ways.

497
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,990
If I suddenly appeared here during the night, you would get too excited.

498
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,810
I can't let you die of happiness, right?

499
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,810
I don't like you to the point that I'll die of happiness.

500
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,720
Really? You will soon.

501
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,970
But why did you come?

502
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,980
I have something to say.

503
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,700
Do you prefer knowing really sad news in advance or after it's passed?

504
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,600
It's something that will definitely happen and you can't prevent it even if you know about it.

505
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,120
If it's something sad that will definitely happen,

506
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,630
then knowing in advance will make it sad for a longer time.

507
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,210
Okay. I'll tell you later.

508
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,620
Do you want a drink?

509
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,850
I was just about to make tea, so you came at just the right time.

510
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,760
Have some before you leave.

511
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,610
Really? I can stay longer?

512
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,390
Isn't this dangerous?

513
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,580
Drinking tea together isn't enough to be dangerous!

514
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,130
You must think you're some kind of homme fatale or something.

515
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,290
How self-centered.

516
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,690
Is it good enough that this is nothing to her? But it's super dangerous to me.

517
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,880
Did he go because it really was dangerous?

518
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,410
Did I say I'd do something to him?

519
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,270
Yes, this is the death bell I lost. Thank you.

520
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,070
But why did Sam Jang have that?

521
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,350
Ah, so that noona picked it up that day.

522
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:33,220
Hey, did that ring by any chance? Check it out.

523
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,480
Yes. It already rang.

524
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,310
Those two have a deadly fate between them?

525
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,340
Son Oh Gong is eternally immortal.

526
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,620
That stone monkey punk didn't even burn to death when he was locked in the Bagua Crucible.

527
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,500
Literally, he's like a rock.

528
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,480
How can a human like Sam Jang kill him?

529
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,680
- In the meantime, Oh Gong's developed a fatal weakness.
- What?

530
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:17,160
The Geumganggo has softened the stone monkey's heart.

531
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,520
Then in order for Sam Jang's summons to be completed,

532
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,350
is she going to kill Son Oh Gong?

533
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,350
Or is she going to die by Son Oh Gong's hands?

534
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,180
Since it's a deadly fate, it would have to be one of the two options, wouldn't it?

535
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,030
No matter which it is, it's the punishment that's been given to the Great Sage by the heavens.

536
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:49,200
The heavens still haven't forgiven that arrogant monkey?

537
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,240
That rascal has never felt true pain before.

538
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,900
That greatly angered the entire heavens.

539
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,820
He needs to feel real pain at least once in order to be forgiven.

540
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,140
Today, your cookies are even more delicious.

541
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,240
They are, aren't they?

542
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,430
I chose the recipe from the list of recommendations on the housewife site.

543
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,580
It tastes good.

544
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,240
Sa Oh Jeong, thank you for making many delicious things for me.

545
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,400
Have some more. I should upload a review.

546
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,050
Here.

547
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:28,210
Thank you for putting me in icy mode often so I won't rot.

548
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:33,790
When spring comes, you'll need to ingest more coldness, so come every day.

549
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,100
Do you want to work part-time at my ice-cream shop?

550
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,220
I'll consider it when spring comes.

551
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,420
Would it be possible for me to meet with the Summer Fairy for a moment?

552
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,590
She doesn't like being woken up during the day.

553
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:59,510
Never mind. Then please be sure to tell her thank you for making me pretty.

554
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,670
Bu Ja, is something wrong?

555
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:08,320
No. The ice cream is really delicious!

556
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,630
The two of you can't break up right now. Continue dating.

557
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,510
The pig is date-able enough for me.

558
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,890
Why? Why? Why?! Why can't we break up?

559
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,940
I mean, Ma Wang can die and come back to life however he pleases

560
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,130
so why can't I break up with this octopus when I want to?

561
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,240
Someone snapped a picture of you two again.

562
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,840
It came out well.

563
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,550
This is so unfair.

564
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,230
Whenever she drinks, she becomes all limp like an octopus.

565
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,310
I, without a choice, being forced to do so,

566
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,700
didn't abandon her, picked her up, and took her to a hotel!

567
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,780
Seriously, nothing happened with this octopus!

568
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,260
Okay.

569
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,700
He's right. Nothing happened.

570
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,480
The pig was not able to perform. (A pun as the word for "doing it" has the same pronunciation as the word for "pig" in Korean.)

571
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,800
This little octopus punk! Seriously!

572
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,550
Hey, did I want to do something with you? Well? Did I?!

573
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,720
- Come here!
- Wow, you're really unbelievable. Hey! What are you doing?

574
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,950
You must be kidding me.

575
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:28,570
Do you want to die?

576
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,030
Bu Ja, what brings you here?

577
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,730
Everyone looks busy.

578
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:39,220
There was just a difference of opinions regarding a business problem.

579
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,800
Secretary Ma, thank you for getting energy beads often for me.

580
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,300
Bu Ja, did you come to practice?

581
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,920
I'm not practicing today.

582
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,120
Zombie, I see you stink less today.

583
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,100
I just met with Winter General so I'm icy right now.

584
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,030
Prince, you should also go back to the dragon sea palace and make amends with your father.

585
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:07,910
Alright. Before you rot further, I'll show you around the dragon sea palace.

586
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,090
Thank you.

587
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,010
Forget seeing the palace with the octopus punk.

588
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,860
Today, let's go to the amusement park that we had agreed upon before.

589
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,670
You have a couple photo-shoot to do today.

590
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,730
We're going to break up.

591
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,390
Let's go, Bu Ja!

592
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,400
Shall we get something delicious to eat first?

593
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,770
What do you want to eat?

594
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:38,070
Beef? Ah, my nose hurts.

595
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:41,820
Ugh, that damn monkey always has to hit my nose.

596
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:47,750
Did Son Oh Gong hit your nose because of me again?

597
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,100
It was because of what happened last time.

598
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,040
I'm fine. He didn't hit me that many times.

599
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,280
Please don't try so hard because of me.

600
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,200
I told you you're my younger brother. It's fine since we're brothers.

601
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,930
Let's get something good to eat and then go have some fun.

602
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,240
I have a prior engagement today.

603
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,820
What prior engagement?

604
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,630
Son Oh Gong is going to take me somewhere nice today.

605
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,740
The Great Sage is?

606
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,060
I told him to stop being mean to you.

607
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,270
I guess he did some reflecting.

608
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:35,960
Jeo Pal Gye, you're the one I'm most thankful towards.

609
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,970
I was happy that you called me your younger brother.

610
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,530
Me, too. I like my younger brother the most.

611
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,770
Son Oh Gong will get mad again if I'm late.

612
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,300
I'll get going.

613
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,940
Have fun!

614
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,570
Goodbye, Jeo Pal Gye!

615
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,580
This land belongs to Kang Dae Seong of the Korea Foundation.

616
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,010
Apparently, construction here has been halted because of this tree.

617
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,820
Then does that mean that evil spirit came out because of this tree?

618
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,920
I don't know. We'll find out once we call it out.

619
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,020
Call it out with your blood.

620
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,240
I guess they're going to cut down the divine tree after all.

621
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,830
Where are you going in the middle of snack time?

622
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:03,590
Why's he...?

623
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,990
Back away from the tree!

624
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,120
Stop!

625
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,030
Sam Jang, is this the person?

626
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:23,160
Yes. He's the man who was possessed by an evil spirit that I saw at the hospital.

627
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,370
No... No...

628
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,530
No...

629
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,860
I've been a guardian for over 1,000 years.

630
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:02,400
You foolish humans! From now on, it's your responsibility!

631
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,010
It looks like the evil spirit disappeared.

632
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,350
The tree has become quiet as well.

633
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:22,230
Good work, Sam Jang. Let's go.

634
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:28,700
But what do you think he meant earlier about being a guardian for over 1,000 years?

635
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,560
This tree must be over 1,000 years old

636
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,280
since that evil spirit had been attached to it for a very long time.

637
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,330
What we got rid of was really an evil spirit, right?

638
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,240
In any case, that man has become normal again, and construction will restart soon.

639
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,090
Let's go.

640
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,380
Hey! Look here, Mr. Park!

641
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,990
Get him up! What's the matter with him?

642
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,010
Hurry!

643
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,710
Are you okay?

644
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,060
What? Did something happen?

645
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,940
This guy! Wow, I'm speechless. Let's go.

646
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,490
What was all that about?

647
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,750
I agreed to burn Bu Ja for her sake.

648
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,460
I figured I should let you know.

649
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,190
Sam Jang is going to be sad.

650
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,170
It's better than letting her see her become an evil spirit.

651
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,680
I want to shorten her grieving time by telling her later.

652
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,070
Seeing as you've gone so far now as to think about Sam Jang's grief,

653
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:08,020
your heart really must have gone soft.

654
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:14,560
Yeah, she could really kill me without lifting a finger.

655
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,310
How could a human possibly kill the Great Sage?

656
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,600
Why are you playing the fool?

657
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,370
You already know about the death bell, don't you?

658
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:30,170
I heard that Secretary Ma gathered information about it from the peddler's grandson.

659
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:36,480
You knew that Sam Jang had the death bell?

660
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,960
Yeah.

661
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,680
And he said it already rang.

662
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:53,870
Then you also know that one of you will kill and one of you will die, don't you?

663
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,460
As long as I've got the Geumganggo on me, I can never kill her.

664
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,890
Then is she really going to kill me?

665
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:10,290
You haven't by chance actually prepared yourself to be killed by her, have you?

666
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,960
Who's to say.

667
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,820
If I don't want to die, then I'd have to use whatever means possible

668
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,480
to get rid of Sam Jang first, wouldn't I?

669
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,680
What should I do when a woman who may possibly kill me is that pretty?

670
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,200
If she's that pretty to you, there's nothing you can do.

671
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,530
Will the Great Sage die by Sam Jang's hands?

672
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:49,360
Ma Wang, don't worry too much about me.

673
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,550
I'll never die.

674
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,360
I'm not worried about you. Die or don't, whatever.

675
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,240
Bu Ja will be coming to see you later.

676
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,030
Don't be a softie and cry.

677
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,020
Hey, dog secretary!

678
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,030
How can you go around without a scarf when it's so cold outside?

679
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,960
I'm fine.

680
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,620
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

681
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,660
The evil spirit has been taken care of.

682
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,690
Son Oh Gong knew about the death bell.

683
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,930
Really?

684
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,130
And yet he's interacting with Sam Jang so nonchalantly like that?

685
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,570
He said he'll never die.

686
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,530
I know the Great Sage.

687
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:46,110
That rascal will definitely get rid of Sam Jang first.

688
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,450
Love?

689
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:10,050
A mere thing like that will never be able to defeat him.

690
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,030
Did something happen?

691
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,830
Nope.

692
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,450
I smell pretty bad, don't I? I'm sorry.

693
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,310
Miss, by chance, isn't your name Jeong Se Ra?

694
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:53,300
Pardon? You know me?

696
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,750
What's that? It belongs to Jeong Se Ra's mom, right?

697
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,390
What do you want to do? Are you going to take it to the hospital room she was moved to?

698
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:10,820
There's nothing worth taking to her. We can just throw it out.

699
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,830
The power was still on.

700
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:23,020
Even though she was hurting and sick, she must have kept it charged in case a call from her daughter came.

701
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:34,920
The woman that was hospitalized here would cry every day over her missing daughter.

702
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,430
There used to be a lot of pictures over there.

703
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:41,920
They must have cleared them all away when she moved hospitals.

704
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,750
You're saying that I'm Jeong Se Ra?

705
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
Here it is!

706
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,010

It's me! It's really me!

709
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,220
Where is my mother right now?

710
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,390
What is that, Hyungnim?

711
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,010
That's Jeong Se Ra's mother's cell phone, isn't it?

712
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,830
What should we do? W-w-who could it be?

713
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:39,020
Mom, is it you? Are you my mom?

714
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,850
I'm Se Ra. Where are you?

715
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,480
Mom, where are you right now?

716
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,870
I'm the person who's taking care of your mother.

717
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,580
Why don't we meet now?

718
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,570
I got cut from the evil spirit that latched onto the tree.

719
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,200
Is that so?

720
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,650
I'm treating you. I'm not trying to make a pass at you.

721
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:31,190
When I cut my hand on the leaf, my blood dripped onto the ground and it shook.

722
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,690
Did something strange come out?

723
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:36,240
No. It quickly became quiet,

724
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,480
and the evil spirit that was latched onto the tree disappeared.

725
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,970
Be careful. Sam Jang's blood can awaken very annoying things.

726
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:49,420
The reason my blood was able to gain that ability is because of you.

727
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,070
Because I set you free and became Sam Jang,

728
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:56,130
even if it awakens annoying things, that's all because of you.

729
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,800
That's right. From now on, everything that happens to you is because of me.

730
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:09,320
So even if I die because of you, there's nothing I can say about it.

731
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,520
What the heck?

732
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,590
Underneath the place where the tree was cut, this was found.

733
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,010
It's a sarcophagus. There wasn't anything else?

734
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:49,500
No, there wasn't. In case it might cause a problem during construction, I quietly took it out.

735
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,120
Good job.

736
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,080
By any chance, is this a relic?

737
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,900
- I'll take care of it. You worked hard.
- Ah, yes.

738
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,110
- I leave the future of the construction in your care.
- Yes.

739
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,490
What is it?

740
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,520
There won't be further problems on the construction site.

741
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,220
What should I do with this sarcophagus?

742
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,130
Smash it to pieces.

743
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,680
Go ahead first. There's something I need to take care of.

744
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,850
You know... about that sad matter that you mentioned earlier...

745
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,320
It keeps bothering me.

746
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,720
If you know in advance, it'll make you sadder for a longer period of time.

747
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,410
There are things that you need to be very sad about.

748
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:21,570
For some reason, I think I need to do that, so I must know.

749
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:24,740
Jin Bu Ja said she was connected to you through your blood.

750
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,310
There must be something that you sense.

751
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:28,620
Is it about Bu Ja?

752
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,510
I agreed to burn her.

753
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,280
She said she's scared of becoming an evil spirit.

754
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,240
While she's still pretty, she wants to disappear.

755
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:44,560
I told her I would do it for her.

756
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:53,480
Where is she right now? She has to say farewell to me at least.

758
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,530
She definitely died, right? Let's quickly get out of here.

759
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:51,240
That's right.

760
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,660
I saw the men who were trying to bury me.

761
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,000
It's you guys.

762
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:26,090
If I take my revenge on them, then I'll have to hurt them.

763
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,710
That scares me.

764
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,510
I don't need revenge.

765
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:36,090
I want to disappear while I'm still pretty like this.

766

So you're saying that the thing that was sealed under that tree is Ah Sa Nyeo?

784
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,390
I'll be sure to burn you while you're pretty.

785
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:09,050
He got hurt because of you, right? Because you called for him.

01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,060
Do you by chance know anything about priestesses?

787
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,300
I want to have you.

788
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,520
I saw her.

789
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,680
Ma Wang, should I help her on your behalf?
