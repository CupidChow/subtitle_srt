00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,330
What happened to Son Oh Gong all of a sudden?

50
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,000
Since you ordered him to stop, and he went against it,

51
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,320
the pain in his heart seems to have intensified.

52
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,420
There were moments when he said he was in pain because of me,

53
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,280
but that was because he was hurt emotionally.

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,700
I never caused him to be physically injured.

55
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,660
And isn't he really strong?

56
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,110
You said there's nothing that can hurt him!

57
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,160
I did say that, but now the Great Sage can be injured.

58
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,420
- You had made him that way.
- I did?

59
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,630
To put it simply, because of the Geumganggo,

60
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,260
his love for you

61
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,200
made the stone-hearted monkey's heart go soft.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,450
Then, because of the Geumganggo, he became weak?

63
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,580
He ended up having a fatal weakness. He could die from it.

64
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,560
Of course, the thing that can kill him

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,130
is you whom he loves,

66
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,660
and only you.

67
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,270
I can possibly kill him?

68
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,790
It's all healed now. Son Oh Gong, thank you.

69
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,550
Drink it. It will also relax you.

My name is Jeong Se Ra.

Isn't my name quite pretty?

Indeed. Pal Gye is your hyung.

Yes, I have to hurry and see him.

88
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,300
You too should go out to see Unni.

Zombie Jin Bu Ja was really annoying,

90
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,790
but Miss Jeong Se Ra is also quite bothersome.

91

Let's go out together, Son Oh Gong.

92

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,170
Later, please burn me here at Sureumdong.

95

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,160
Will you do that?

97
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,200
Since I'm letting you live in luxury, might as well do that for you, too.

Thank you.

99
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,410
Where on earth is Bu Ja? I can't get in touch with her either.

100
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,220
According to my brother, she left after saying goodbye like a person going on a very long trip.

101
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,480
For some reason, I'm feeling uneasy.

102
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,810
You don't think anything will happen, right?

103
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,570
It was kind of weird when she said goodbye.

104
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,630
Oh. I should have just tagged along.

105
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,120
Zombie is already dead, so even if she wants to, she can't die.

106
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,570
Unless you burn her with strong energy.

107
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,330
She said she was going somewhere with the Great Sage.

108
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,830
By chance, he isn't burning Bu Ja, is he?

109
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,380
He's so worried about Zombie, isn't he?

110
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,550
How did the pig get so into the zombie?

111
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,140
Are you being jealous right now, Prince?

112
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
How did an octopus get attracted to a pig?

113
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,600
Jeo Pal Gye, you're the one I'm most thankful towards.

114
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,300
I was happy that you called me your younger brother.

- Bu Ja!
- Jeo Pal Gye.

116

What a relief. You scared me.

117
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm fine.

118
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,930
I couldn't contact you. I really thought something happened

119
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,920
so I was about to crash into 5050.

120

Jeong Se Ra called her mother's cell phone.

123
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,410
They were trying to handle it by themselves, but it seems that she ran away.

124
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,970
Th-that's not it. The dead girl is dead again. This time too, she disappeared.

Y-y-yes.

He keeps saying weird things like that.

127

You say she called her mother's cell phone?

128
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,990
Then call her using that cell phone.

129
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,930
If she isn't dead this time either, she'll show up alive again.

- Hyungnim isn't in at the moment.

I think he might be in Sureumdong.

132

Do you think you can take me over there?

133
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,510
If you want to meet Hyungnim, you can call him, can't you?

134
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,510
I won't be able to do that since I'm afraid that he might get hurt.

135
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,950
Nobody is able to go to Sureumdong unless he wants you to.

Please let me in. Let's have a chat.

What should I do?

Hey.

142
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,520
Does it hurt?

143
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,580
I was super hurt earlier because of you.

144
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,060
We are even now.

145
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,770
You know, you always tell me not to make a pass at you,

146
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,680
but you have a tendency to start stuff.

147
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,960
I guess it was worthwhile getting hurt.

148
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,620
It's a warm tea. Drink some.

149
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,100
You like warm things, don't you?

150

Hey, are you hungry?

- No, I'm fine.

Hey, would you like me to get you some fruit then?

153

Why are you constantly saying, "hey"? It's not even "honey".

When you say "hey," who are you referring to?

So you're not going to call me by my name ever again?

Oh, so you want to break our contract then?

Are you going to take off the Geumganggo then?

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,880
I still constantly need you, so I will have to call you.

163
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,630
You said that you came to really like me,

164
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,280
but I guess you don't like me that much since you don't want to help me take off this bracelet.

165
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,230
- You know, I ...
- Jin Seon Mi, you did well. You did the right thing.

166
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,180
Even if I try to shake you up without a plan like just now, don't waver at all.

167
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,220
I'm warning you.

168
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,110
I to you...

169
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:18,100
♫ Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt ♫

170
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,170
It's because I love you.

171
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,140
♫ And I'll grit my teeth like this ♫

172
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:29,220
♫ I'll hold back my tears. Don't worry ♫

173
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,550
Hey, don't you think you're being too much here?

174
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,790
- Why? What's wrong?
- Try some.

175
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,960
So salty.

176
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm sorry. I was so out of it earlier, so I think I put salt instead of sugar.

177
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,470
I will make you another one.

178
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,990
♫ Please just go the way you were going ♫

179
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:15,630
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

180
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,190
♫ Anyway, it's already been decided ♫

181
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,620
♫ Even though I knew this would be farewell ♫

182
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,670
Do you think Son Oh Gong will let her know that it's the death bell instead of the love bell?

183
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,210
For Sam Jang to continuously mistake it as the love bell

184
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,020
and fall in love with Son Oh Gong is more advantageous for him.

185
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,040
He's never going to tell her, ever.

186
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,710
Don't you think there's a chance he won't be able to say anything since he doesn't want her to be heartbroken after thinking it was the love bell?

187
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,490
Son Oh Gong is a bad guy.

188
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,610
He'll never lose to such a thing as love.

189
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,590
Ma Wang, it looks like you're cheering for Son Oh Gong not to die since he's such a bad guy.

190
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,710
Why are you making me into his ally?

191
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,500
I hate that punk. I really hate him.

192
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,600
Yes, Ma Wang.

193
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
Using the death bell,

194
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,610
Son Oh Gong will bewitch Sam Jang more and more.

195
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,670
Because he's a bad guy.

196
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,200
He said to put it into that container and dump it into the ocean today. Let's move it.

197
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,010
Hyungnim, this is a bit creepy.

198
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,430
My name is Jeong Se Ra.

199
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,140
Jeong Se Ra? Wow, you have such a pretty name.

200
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,200
Man, I gave you such a tacky name as Jin Bu Ja.

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,580
And now this pig feels so embarrassed for that.

202
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,160
Jin Bu Ja was also great. It means wealthy.

203
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,880
It's the best indeed.

204
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,760
Jeo Pal Gye, you can continue to remember me and think of me as Bu Ja.

205
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,030
Then you will continue to be my younger brother, Jin Bu Ja.

206
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,700
Sure, I will continue to be Jin Bu Ja.

207
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,370
What's wrong?

208
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,640
I think it's because I put my arm back together after it fell off earlier today.

209
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
I'm alright now.

210
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,300
I put aside some energy beads from my live performance for you earlier today. Let me go bring you some.

211
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,180
You wait for me, okay?

212
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,980
[Mom]

213
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,460
Hello?

214
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,280
Are you Jeong Se Ra? As expected, you're alive and answering your phone.

215
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,150
Who are you?

216
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,020
I'm the one who is taking care of your mother right now.

217
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,060
I would like to meet you quietly.

218
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,430
Can you come over?

219
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,610
Bu Ja, I brought you this...

220
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,360
Where did she go? Bu Ja. Bu Ja.

221
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,810
♫ Hello Bull, your owner has come back.

222
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,250
You guys are all hiding so you can surprise me, right?

223
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,390
Hurry up and come out, all of you.

224
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,220
Are they not home?

225
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,480
I almost died and got discharged from the hospital but...

226
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,860
Nobody is here.

227
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,000
Sa Oh Jeong obviously knows that I like porridge,

228
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,260
but he never makes it for me, ever.

229
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,030
And I was so f-ing sick too.

230
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,550
What's all this crap?

231
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,400
This kid knows nothing about cleaning for goodness sake.

232
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,970
What if the bathtub gets clogged?

233
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,040
Bu Ja isn't here, so Pal Gye won't come.

234
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,460
I guess the Jade Dragon won't be coming either.

235
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,470
Ah, this is driving me crazy.

236
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,390
Darn it.

237
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,550
Ma Wang, you're home.

238
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,350
Why are you here so late?

239
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,510
Did you clean up the place?

240
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,060
Yeah, I haven't been here in a while, and now the house is such a mess.

241
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,340
Even so, I've been discharged from a hospital and came home,

242
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,330
so you should've cleaned it up a little.

243
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,930
Oh Jeong has been so busy with the shareholders meeting so there was no chance to keep up the house.

244
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,430
Is this Oh Jeong's house or something?

245
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,440
You don't even know how to differentiate a regular trash bag from a compostable trash bag, right?

246
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,980
I put the house under your name too,

247
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,400
but you still don't even want to contribute in anyway whatsoever.

248
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,810
Ma Wang, congratulations on being discharged.

249
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,230
What's all this?

250
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,970
This is porridge, which you like.

251
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,970
I don't know how to make it so I bought it. And here's your congratulatory wine.

252
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,970
Oh, you bought some porridge for me, eh?

253
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,730
You bought mushroom porridge, which I really like.

254
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,980
Yup, I heard that this porridge place makes delicious porridge.

255
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,800
Eat this while I take out the trash.

256
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,410
And have some wine while you're at it too.

257
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,700
You didn't put anything strange in here, right?

258
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,660
Seriously for goodness sake.

259
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,780
It looks like you added extra mushrooms.

260
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,820
- You should come and sit down here, too. Let's eat together.
- Me, too?

261
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,400
I mean, you almost died too after all.

262
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,210
Ma Wang, are you being considerate of me?

263
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,300
Come on, I'm worried you put something weird in here, so I'm sharing it with you.

264
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,020
I didn't put anything in it. Nothing!

265
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,300
You're so full of fears.

266
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,200
Looks good.

267
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,980
Did you tell Sam Jang about the death bell?

268
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,440
Why? Are you worried because you think I might die? Scared of being left alone?

269
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,300
Forget it. Just stuff yourself with the porridge.

270
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,020
Ah, I heard from Sam Jang that you caught an evil spirit attached to a tree today.

271
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,630
That's right. She took care of it all with Secretary Ma.

272
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,160
That really was an evil spirit, right?

273
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,470
You didn't accidentally mess with something else?

274
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,410
Hey, because I have to clean up the shit I made by releasing you, I'm suffering like this right now.

275
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,870
Do you think I'd make shit again? Am I some kind of shit-maker?

276
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,310
Right? Surely, you wouldn't have made shit again.

277
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,720
Exactly.

278
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,600
Nothing's going to happen.

279
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,560
I didn't think you'd actually come, but I see you're here.

280
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,140
I guess you're fearless since you don't die.

281
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,230
Were you the person who killed me?

282
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,850
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

283
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,670
You killed me by mistake?

284
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,890
How are you still alive though?

285
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,320
That's really intriguing.

286
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,760
Where is my mother?

287
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,800
I asked a question but you're answering with another question.

288
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
I hate that.

289
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,420
Let me meet my mother.

290
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,600
And it looks like you have no intention of answering me either.

291
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,780
But even so, I'll be nice and answer you.

292
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,770
She's over there.

293
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,860
Over there?

294
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,760
Open this up!

295
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,000
Please open it!

296
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,140
Throw her into the sea together with the sarcophagus.

297
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,220
- Then she won't be able to come back again.
- Open this up!

298
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,950
Please open this!

299
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,380
Please open it!

300
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,310
Open this up!

What the heck?

302
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,020
What's going on?

303
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,920
What the heck is this?

304
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,680
Now what's happening?

305
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,490
Go in and check it out.

306
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,680
What are you?

307
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,870
You all are going to have to become a sacrificial offering for me.

308
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,180
Now what's this?

309

[Lucifer Entertainment]

310
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,100
It looks like a real headache-inducer woke up yesterday.

311
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,300
So you're saying that the thing that was sealed under that tree

312
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,200
is Ah Sa Nyeo who has been asleep for over 1,000 years?

313
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,780
Ah Sa Nyeo? What's that?

314
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,680
A priestess who served the king. She was sealed after dying.

315
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,630
If it's an evil spirit that's been around over 1,000 years, I imagine it will be worth quite a lot of points.

316
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,540
Oh. Ma Wang, how many points do you still need? You're keeping track, right?

317
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,720
Of course I am.

318
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,780
You have to do it right. They're always trying to con me.

319
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,190
Ah Sa Nyeo is not someone you can take lightly.

320
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,750
Unlike an evil spirit, if she hides in a human, you won't be able to tell the difference.

321
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,690
She can use humans by controlling their minds.

322
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,490
She is a being who has the ability to even wake a dragon and crown a king.

323
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,030
If something were to go wrong, it's possible she could turn the whole world upside down.

324
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,700
So Ma Wang woke up a huge problem.

325
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,450
Hey, why is that my fault? Sam Jang was the one who did it.

326
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,510
Why are you blaming Sam Jang for your mistake?

327
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,090
You set that evil spirit free just like how you set me free.

328
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,860
Ma Wang should lose points then.

329
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,920
Hey, why should my points be taken away? Have you no idea what I went through to get them?

330
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,460
This isn't the time to be pointing fingers at each other.

331
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,190
At any rate, Ma Wang started this business

332
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,270
so find Ah Sa Nyeo, Ma Wang.

333
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,010
Because of the side effects of the medicine that was suppressing my strength,

334
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,530
I still need to recuperate.

335
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,070
It hasn't been long since I came back to life.

336
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,570
I think that will be difficult. Please give me a break.

337
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,960
Then, Great Sage, you should go find and take care of it.

338
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,890
Why's this acting up again? Ow...

339
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,340
I'm dying!

340
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Don't you know that my heart has gone all soft?

341
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,840
Ever since then, I get heart attacks often.

342
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,170
Oh, my heart...

343
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,180
I have to take medicine to endure it.

344
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,670
Just watch me. Watch.

345
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,970
Hey, these are breath mints.

346
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,720
Oh? You're not coughing. You must be fine.

347
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,090
You two!

348
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,340
If you guys are just going to think of different ways to get out of it, then forget it.

349
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,480
I'll have to discuss with the rest of the heavenly realm how to handle Ah Sa Nyeo.

350
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,030
Ugh, really now...

351
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,830
Why did you have to go and wake that thing up! I clearly asked you about it!

352
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,770
And you went and said it was nothing! How could a bull be so careless.

353
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,250
Ugh, seriously!

354
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,020
Hey, stop that!

355
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,510
You stupid bull!

356
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,440
Don't! Don't do that!

357
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,990
- Stop it!
- This stupid bull. Sheesh.

358
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,760
Hey, it was thanks to my carelessness that you were set free from the Five Elements Mountain, wasn't it?

359
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,880
You ungrateful thug.

360
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,490
Anyway, don't call Sam Jang for something so dangerous and clean up your own shit.

361
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,020
You're the first shit that I made.

362
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,400
I see First Shit has the gall to criticize Second Shit. Really...

363
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,240
At any rate, avoiding shit is the best thing to do. I'm going to stay away from it.

364
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,850
It woke up from Sam Jang's blood.

365
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,130
Ah Sa Nyeo is going to go after Sam Jang,

366
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,640
and in the end, that shit is going to be yours to clean up.

367
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,740
You monkey banana.

368
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,180
Stop spitting! Are you out of your mind?

369
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,650
Oh? This tree is...

370
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,180
[Korea Foundation in Icheon City, Large-scale Culture and Art Space is Being Built]

371
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,160
It came out in the press.

372
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,850
CEO, you plan on buying land in Icheon? Good choice!

373
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,550
Is the land price going up in this city?

374
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,260
Of course. That entire area is owned by the Korea Foundation.

375
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,220
That professor, Kang Dae Seong. His family is the Korea Foundation.

376
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,000
He's from the most prestigious family, smart, and handsome.

377
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,660
My wife likes him even more than idols.

378
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,770
If he becomes president, it will be awesome for the city of Icheon.

379
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,910
So he's a really impressive person.

380
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,650
By the way, are the roads icy or something? Why's the jajangmyeon taking so long?

381
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,600
Huh? Why's that girl looking up here?

382
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,090
Does she want to rent a room?

383
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,340
Ugh, I'm so hungry...

384
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,320
That woman is in there. Should I say hi?

385
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,230
Who sent them?

386
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,300
Did Jonathan send them?

387
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,050
As I expected, he is a romantic.

388
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,620
My friend, my Jonathan.

389
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,060
CEO, I will get you a vase so you can leave it on your desk.

390
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,440
When did I get a cut?

391
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,620
Tasty.

392
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,380
Hey? Did your hyung take it?

393
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,910
I see she likes flowers.

394
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,420
Is it Ah Sa Nyeo?

395
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,540
I see that while Soo Bo Ri has gone to discuss with the heavenly realm, you will be carrying out his duty for him.

396
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,890
If I carry out his duties in his stead well, in my becoming a deity,

397
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,130
I'm sure I will earn extra points.

398
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:46,630
The work you'll do today... you're going to bring down divine retribution upon this human.

399
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,010
[Police Report]

400
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,790
He looks like he deserves it.

401
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,850
To show that the heavens aren't indifferent to human livelihood,

402
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,740
there is nothing better than divine retribution.

403
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,240
But nowadays, punishment is so rare.

404
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:06,400
When I become a deity, I'm just going to let the chips fall where they may.

405
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,550
Oh! The one who is doomed has arrived there.

406
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,210
Really.

407
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,300
That wretched dude.

408
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,650
Excuse me.

409
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,350
Could you hand me your cellphone for a second?

410
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,730
What the heck?

411
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,310
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,940
You bastard Jo Sae Pal, scammed 23,600 people

413
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,380
out of 1.35 trillion won, didn't you?

414
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,980
97 people committed suicide because of you and 2,600 orphans were created.

415
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,460
7,856 households were broken.

416
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,090
You murderous bastard were happy and overjoyed that you escaped human punishment.

417
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:07,690
So today you will receive the wrath which heaven brings down.

418
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,000
After falling down here today, you won't die.

419
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,420
Even though all of your limbs will be broken, you won't die,

420
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,950
and after surviving for 9 days, you'll be rescued.

421
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,470
Even if you breathe, you will suffer agony in all of your joints.

422
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,950
And will live like that for the rest of your life.

423
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,050
Now, you must fall.

424

P-p-please spare me.

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,230
Because of sparing people like you,

there is talk that heaven is indifferent.

Bastard.

431
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,620
Ma Wang, carrying out retribution work is very gratifying.

432
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,780
That sort of human shouldn't be born ever again.

433
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,240
In any case, when I become a deity

434
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,880
I can become officially involved in human affairs.

435
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,520
That woman...

436
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,030
has already been born in this world.

You can't, Ma Wang.

439
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,450
You know you must never become involved.

440
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,930
Even if you are involved, it doesn't prevent her tragic death,

441
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,880
and there will be an even worse misfortune in her next life.

442
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,930
You're back, President.

443
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You can go home now. You worked hard, Eun Ji.

444
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,800
Yes. You worked hard.

445
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,920
Who are you?

446
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,790
Ah, it's Bu Ja.

447
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,710
Ma Wang.

448
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,330
What were you doing here?

449
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,270
I have been eating the energy beads.

450
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,940
I heard that you fell from a high location.

451
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,930
Take the beads and leave.

452
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,290
Thank you, Ma Wang.

453
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,610
Have you found the beautiful deity?

454
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:26,680
I've told you all of the stories about Ja Eun before.

455
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,410
Actually, today

456
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,780
I saw her.

457
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,010
It must be hard for her in this life too because she was crying.

458
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,900
You said you couldn't interfere with her fate after she became a human.

459
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,430
That's right.

460
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,560
Ma Wang, should I help her on your behalf?

461
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,220
I am not a human, a demon, or a ghost.

462
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:11,820
If I interfere in such a status, might heaven not be aware?

463
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:18,610
How did you come up with that idea?

464
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:23,360
Because I thought I might become of help to you, I'm mentioning it.

465
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,860
However, deceiving the heavens is not easy.

466
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,670
I overstepped my boundaries.

467
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,950
Then, please relax for now.

468
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,880
Ma Wang gave me the energy beads.

469
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,160
Bu Ja?

470
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,130
You're emitting an unfamiliar scent.

471
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,550
I've changed the scent which masks the rotting smell.

472
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,640
It's the scent of roses. It's not bad.

473
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,910
Bu Ja! Where did you go again?

474
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,460
Are you going to keep making me worried by going off the radar and disappearing like this?

475
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,520
Pig, we're on our way to our couple photo shoot right now.

476
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,580
If you keep acting like this, there won't be a break-up article!

477
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,480
Seriously!

478
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,410
I'll be going straight home once my schedule is finished, so stay right at home. Got it?

479
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,530
This Bu Ja girl was quite loved.

480
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,760
But even so, rather than this zombie,

481
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,850
it would be better to steal Sam Jang's body.

482
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,960
It's Son Oh Gong.

483
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,360
Hey, Zombie!

484
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,250
- Son Oh Gong.
- Are you on your way back from seeing Ma Wang?

485
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,370
Yes. He gave me energy beads.

486
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,740
He did?

487
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,860
What's wrong?

488
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,070
I feel like I fixed up a girl that was ripped to shreds way too well.

489
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,810
You probably don't need energy beads.

490
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,530
I'm the one who needs a pick-me-up. Me. Give them here.

491
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,540
If I've graced you with that much luxury, then you should at least pay up this much, right?

492
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,260
I'm going.

493
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,500
Hey!

494
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,300
I picked it up off the road on my way here.

495
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,180
You like flowers, don't you?

496
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,460
You said you wanted to disappear while you're pretty like a flower.

497
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,520
Yes, I did.

498
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,870
I'll be sure to burn you while you're pretty, Jin Bu Ja.

499
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,260
You're not Jin Bu Ja now, right?

500
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,630
It's Jeong Se Ra. Jeong Se Ra. Geez.

501
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,760
- Yes.
- I'll burn you next time for sure.

502
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,270
The Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

503
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:17,520
If I possess Sam Jang, will he become mine?

504
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,050
Ma Wang! Ma Wang!

505
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,720
Ah, what's with him now?

506
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,040
Did you see it? You did, didn't you? She said you met.

507
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,060
- What?
- You didn't know? That thing just now!

508
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,680
Who?

509
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,420
That priestess hiding behind Bu Ja's face and body!

510
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,160
That wasn't Bu Ja?

511
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,840
Wow, there's really no helping you when your energy is low, Ma Wang.

512
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,470
That wasn't Bu Ja.

513
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,910
That wasn't Bu Ja but the priestess?

514
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:53,680
Yes, Ah Sa Nyeo.

515
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,450
Ah Sa Nyeo?

516
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,410
Why did she come here?

517
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:02,550
What does she want to get by pretending she's Bu Ja?

518
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,110
Ugh, this is...

519
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:11,370
I must not have realized because I was tired.

520
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,650
And so? What did you do with Ah Sa Nyeo? Did you take care of her?

521
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,750
- I just let her go of course.
- What?

522
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,630
You said you recognized her, so why did you just let her go?

523
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,490
Why do I have to do that by myself?

524
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,590
She has pitch black eyes and doesn't seem just ordinarily strong. We should do it together!

525
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,170
Come on now, I don't have any strength right now because I'm low on energy.

526
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,640
Take care of it yourself. Geez.

527
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,890
Is this how you're going to be?

528
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,530
I'm going to have to grab my heart again. I'm taking out the meds. I'm taking them out.

529
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,550
Okay, okay!

530
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:43,130
Instead of shirking it off on each other, let's just split the work between us.

531
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:47,430
I'll capture her, so you figure out a way to seal her again.

532
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,220
Since she came out from under the divine tree,

533
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,730
checking things out there should be enough.

534
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,360
Okay.

535
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,640
But, Ma Wang, why do you think she looked for you first?

536
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,490
You didn't make some kind of hush-hush deal with her, did you?

537
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,140
She just took the energy beads and left.

538
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,470
Don't stab me in the back. I mean it.

539
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,860
I'm not going to! Do you think I'm some kind of thug like you?

540
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,420
You think everyone's just like you. Sheesh.

541
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,450
Ah Sa Nyeo's proposal

542
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,160
was extremely tempting.

543
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:52,540
Ma Wang, should I help her on your behalf?

544
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,110
I ignored it when I thought it was just Bu Ja saying that.

545
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:03,340
But it's a different story if a priestess with immense power is offering to help me.

546
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:08,470
Then you should ruthlessly backstab Son Oh Gong of course.

547
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,050
Once Son Oh Gong lures her, you should entice her onto your side.

548
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,680
Yeah. We don't know what will happen,

549
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,490
so get another contract ready.

550
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,460
You're going back to America?

551
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,040
Yes. I'm going back tomorrow.

552
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,400
When my movie comes out next year, I'll invite you to the film festival for it.

553
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,330
Thank you.

554
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:45,510
Ah! Also, thank you for sending the roses.

555
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,760
Even though a rotting fairy took them all away right afterwards.

556
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,400
Roses?

557
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:56,100
Weren't you the one who sent the roses?

558
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,340
I had prepared a different gift for you.

559
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,570
That necklace's name is "Happy Ending."

560
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:23,670
Just like how the brave little girl gets a happy ending in my movie,

561
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:28,980
I hope for a happy ending for you and your fairy, Seon Mi.

562
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:48,320
Happy ending? So it's pretty much the same as the match made in heaven.

563
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,600
Oh? Where did the match-made-in-heaven bell go?

564
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,490
Did it disappear since it already rang?

565
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,430
I didn't even get to show it to Son Oh Gong.

566
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:13,200
I see, so the bell sound that Sam Jang heard was the sound of the death bell.

567
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,360
She thinks it was the sound of a love bell though.

568
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,990
Don't tell her. Just let her think that.

569
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:26,400
Right. Leaving it be like that will let her be happy.

570
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,650
The matter of dying and killing is too sad.

571
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:36,040
Knowing in advance will just make it sad for longer.

572
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,150
Did Bu Ja come here today?

573
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,270
Yes. Just a bit ago. She took a lipstick.

574
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,550
She liked the rose-colored lipstick, so I gave it to her.

575
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,900
Wow, such a sly fox.

576
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,600
Sly fox? Me?

577
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:02,090
No. Say, Summer Fairy, do you by chance know anything about priestesses?

578
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:08,470
You're under the impression that I know a lot about priestesses because I'm a fairy, but I don't.

579
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,940
When it comes to priestesses,

580
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:15,050
- isn't there a person that you know well that's similar to one?
- Who?

581
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:19,420
Sam Jang. Sam Jang is also a kind of priestess.

582
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,500
She's a human but she's able to do things connected to the spiritual world.

583
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,450
You don't say.

584
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,900
So that is why that priestess is hanging around Sam Jang.

585
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,680
I'm surprised that you wanted to eat meat.

586
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,510
Bu Ja, didn't you not like meat?

587
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:47,870
Maybe it's because I got severely injured, I wanted to eat meat.

588
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,740
I heard Hyungnim took you to Sureumdong and fixed you up?

589
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,420
Yes.

590
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,840
Bu Ja, weren't you originally right-handed?

591
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,470
Sa Oh Jeong, wasn't I left-handed?

592
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,320
Oh. Yes, that's right. You were left-handed.

593
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,210
Help yourself to lots of meat.

594
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,450
Thank you.

595
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:45,370
Sa Oh Jeong, could you make some of Unni's favorite food?

596
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,230
I want to go see her.

597
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,330
What do you want to do about that sarcophagus?

598
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:01,930
Throw it out. Toss it into the ocean with the trailer as orginally planned.

599
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,020
A rose.

600
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,520
It still has a strong scent.

601
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,500
Is she not dead?

602
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,190
I was told a sarcophagus came out from under the tree.

603
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,660
That's right. The tree's roots were wrapped around the sarcophagus like a cocoon.

604
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,940
Then where is that sarcophagus now?

605
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,060
It was moved to a warehouse secretly.

606
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,000
There's still a scent of roses.

607
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,100
It must be true that it was moved from here.

608
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,850
It looks like they already threw it out.

609
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:03,330
Or it's possible it was taken somewhere else.

610
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:07,210
What use would a human have for Ah Sa Nyeo's sarcophagus?

611
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:11,040
You mentioned Korean Foundation's Kang Dae Seong, right?

612
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,300
Did he learn that Ah Sa Nyeo is a priestess who can crown a king,

613
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:20,470
and so he took away the sarcophagus?

614
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:48,030
I think that woman will come look for this again.

615
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,820
I came to see you, Unni.

616
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,980
Bu Ja, you got a lot better.

617
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,910
Yes. I brought food that Sa Oh Jeong made.

618
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,750
Thank you.

619
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,250
These are roses.

620
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,680
They're pretty.

621
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,070
Let's go in and eat together.

622
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:07,300
Oh, come inside.

623
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,110
You have a lotus flower smell.

624
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,710
Yes, my blood is like that.

625
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,790
You also have my blood in you.

626
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,890
Yes. The one who woke me up was Sam Jang.

627
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:48,940
Son Oh Gong isn't here?

628
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,680
Yes. These days, we're in an awkward situation.

629
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,770
Honestly, on the day you got hurt, he got hurt a little too.

630
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,810
I know. He got hurt because of you, right?

631
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,530
Because you called for him.

632
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,160
Then you shouldn't keep calling for him.

633
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,610
That would be so troublesome.

634
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,520
I know.

635
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,700
If you don't call Son Oh Gong,

636
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,720
you won't be able to do anything, right?

637
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,780
To be protected by the Great Sage,

638
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,170
don't you think you should have a special ability?

639
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,200
What ability?

640
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:53,100
- Son Oh Gong.
- Are you two eating good food secretly?

641
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,400
How much luxury have I provided to you all of this time?

642
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,950
Yet you pack all of Oh Jeong's food and bring it here to eat?

643
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,240
You should have called me first.

644
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,690
Then, you two go ahead and eat.

645
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:09,300
Where are you going? Come over here.

646
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,070
Come over here.

647
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,870
Sit over here.

648
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,320
Why are you throwing away perfectly fine flowers?

649
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,440
You threw away all the flowers that came to my real estate office as a gift too, didn't you?

650
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,460
- Yes.
- Why?

651
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,910
You're already so pretty like this. Why would I need to look at flowers?

652
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,900
I don't need flowers.

653
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,850
And those flowers are dangerous.

654
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:42,290
What?

655
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,540
I told you not to get hurt, didn't I?

656
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,620
I got a scratch without realizing it.

657
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,490
Don't get hurt.

658
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:02,050
Even though I'll still think you're pretty with the scar, it upsets me.

659
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,730
Looks like I don't have to wait anymore.

660
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,460
What?

661
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,340
Just something. A bad bull bastard.

662
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,170
If we want to find the sarcophagus that Kang Dae Seong has,

663
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,880
I think you are going to have to risk exposing your existence.

664
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,680
Why go through that risk?

665
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,260
I plan to find the sarcophagus later.

666
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,230
Son Oh Gong is probably waiting for you.

667
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:55,820
Knowing his personality, after holding onto Ah Sa Nyeo, he'll probably get into a fight with her.

668
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,360
It'll be dangerous to fight it out in Sam Jang's house,

669
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,510
so he'll drag her to Sureumdong.

670
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:03,200
When the two of them are done fighting it out,

671
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:08,940
we'll know what it is that Ah Sa Nyeo wants.

672
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,520
As expected, Ma Wang, you're great.

673
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:21,020
But... what exactly does the Priestess want?

674
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,240
- Come with me.
- To where?

675
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,210
- Sureumdong.
- Your house?

676
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,710
Yes.

677
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,770
I told you I would burn you.

678
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:45,540
Ah, that's not necessary anymore.

679
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:50,790
No. I think I must burn you.

680
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Let's go quietly.

681
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,340
Go ahead and eat. I'll go to Sureumdong to get a nice bottle of alcohol.

682
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,870
Alcohol? I have alcohol at home.

683
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:11,600
No, I'll get you a really priceless bottle that you'll like.

684
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,910
You have to take Bu Ja with you?

685
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:18,090
Yes. Bu Ja came with me to Sureumdong last time too.

686
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,630
Right?

687
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,070
Yes.

688
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,380
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

The food is cold now. Why aren't they back?

691
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,020
Should I call him?

692
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,440
Oh, why are you here, Ma Wang?

693
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,620
- I came to stop you from doing it.
- What?

694
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,520
Sam Jang, don't call Son Oh Gong tonight.

695
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,200
Son Oh Gong has to take care of something important there.

696
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,070
Did we come here to fight?

697
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,560
Are you crazy?

698
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,830
There are so many expensive bottles of alcohol here. Why would we fight here?

699
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:49,930
- You're Ah Sa Nyeo?
- Yes, Great Sage Son Oh Gong.

700
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,670
You've been asleep for 1,000 years, so there must be many things you want to do now that you're awake.

701
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,820
I don't want to stop you.

702
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,360
Ma Wang is going to interrupt you while you do what you want.

703
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,030
He also went to find your sarcophagus.

704
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:06,830
Don't tell him that I told you and go to Ma Wang.

705
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:13,200
You really won't stop me from doing things?

706
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,870
What do you want to do?

707
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,400
I have to do what I can do.

708
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,580
What can you do?

709
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:29,420
I want to become Sam Jang.

710
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,730
I want to have you.

711
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:52,970
Son Oh Gong, you will come to protect me from now on.

712
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,600
Why am I so popular these days?

713
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,480
That sounds more like something you can't do.

714
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:50,180
I can manipulate souls.
