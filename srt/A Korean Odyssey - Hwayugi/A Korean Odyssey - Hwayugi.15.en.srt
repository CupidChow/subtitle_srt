[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,220
You're the only one in this world who can kill me.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,480
Because if you tell me to die, I'll die.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,370
The thing that can kill him is you, whom he loves, and only you.

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,890
You can't lock me up.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,460
- S—
- You want to call Son Oh Gong?

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,020
If you call him, he'll die.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,800
- He won't die!
- He got hurt when you called him, didn't he?

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,180
Stop, Son Oh Gong! Don't!

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,640
Why do you think that is?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,200
You two have a fate that rang the death bell.

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:04,130
This bell lets you know of a deadly fate in which one person dies and the other kills.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,180
Choose.

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,480
Are you going to call Son Oh Gong, get out of here alive, then kill him,

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,720
or are you going to disappear here by yourself?

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,590
You're going to sleep for eternity.

24

You sleep here.

25
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm going to wake up in your body now.

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,360
I've entered Sam Jang's body.

27
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,810
- You're awake now?
- What made you come by?

28
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,980
Did I always come by because you called me? I came because I missed you.

29
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,110
Are you really tired? How could you have slept so deeply?

30
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,760
I was dreaming a good dream.

31
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:52,060
- What dream?
- A dream in which I was looking for the thing I wanted most.

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,710
Did you find it?

33
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,510
I did. It was great.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,030
You look like you're really happy.

35
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,880
Yeah.

36
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,820
Then keep dreaming a good dream.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,320
Just as the Great Sage said, Ah Sa Nyeo has gone into Sam Jang's body.

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,550
Is Sam Jang dead?
 [Episode 15]

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,780
No, that can't be.

40
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,660
Sam Jang's drop of blood in my body is still the same as ever.

41
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,670
She's alive somewhere.

42
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,120
Then she should call for Son Oh Gong.

43
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,820
Why isn't she calling for him?

44
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,350
Indeed. There's something strange about this.

45
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,070
Since she has Sam Jang's appearance,

46
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,700
doesn't that mean he can't harm Ah Sa Nyeo as she is?

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,340
He decided to string her along until he finds a solution so that she doesn't run off with Sam Jang's body.

48
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,490
Will he be able to fool Ah Sa Nyeo?

49
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,160
When she possessed Bu Ja, she had all of Bu Ja's memories.

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,180
It won't be easy to fool her.

51
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,300
Plus that monkey is unexpectedly stupid.

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,040
Ah Sa Nyeo very strongly desired the Great Sage as her wedding partner.

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,010
Then she's definitely going to try to go all the way with Son Oh Gong tonight.

54
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,300
How well he can guard himself against her is the crucial point tonight.

55
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,620
You absolutely mustn't break down, Son Oh Gong.

56
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,450
I'm the prettiest in your eyes, right?

57
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,020
You were concerned about that, huh?

58
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
What's wrong?

59
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,640
You always worried that I wouldn't find you pretty if the Geumgganggo was taken off.

60
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,190
It still bothers you, right?

61
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm okay though.

62
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,120
I know you're pretending to be okay with it.

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,270
I'm a really bad guy for wanting to hold you even though I know that.

64
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,630
So I'm stopping. Because I love you.

65
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,570
All right. We still have time after all.

66
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,620
We're going to hold our wedding soon, too, aren't we?

67
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,290
- Are we not?
- We are.

68
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm going to marry my one and only bride in this world.

69
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,590
Let's go out.

70
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,180
Call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger.

71
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,610
I will always appear and protect you.

72
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,820
I'm extremely scared, having a hard time, and in danger right now.

73
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,130
Jin Seon Mi, where are you?

74
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,660
In regards to your decision to get married,

75
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,130
first, I congratulate you.

76
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,250
And I will prepare a lavish wedding reception for you.

77
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,450
Leave the food to me.

78
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,980
Thank you, everyone.

79
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,740
Ah, this is my wedding ring.

80
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,290
Ah, I see. Yes.

81
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,760
As promised, I selected your wedding dress for you.

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,080
Would you like to take a look at it?

83
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,070
Right now? Where is it?

84
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,340
It's in Ma Wang's room.

85
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,740
Sure. I'll go take a look now.

86
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,040
Let's go.

87
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,380
I'll be back after looking at it.

88
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,070
Okay.

89
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,220
Hey, Son Oh Gong, you're being too obvious.

90
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
I'm holding myself back.

91
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,470
She really is totally like Sam Jang though.

92
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,040
She even smells the same! Right, Ma Wang?

93
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,410
She's even gone so far as to take over all of Sam Jang's energy.

94
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,310
Then again, she would have to be that confident

95
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,980
for her to come here out on her own volition.

96
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,870
No. She doesn't feel like Sam Jang at all to me.

97
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,030
Because of the chill Ma Wang is going through, the room is a little cold.

98
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,130
Ah, you're right. It is.

99
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,610
Do you like it?

100
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,150
Yes. Can I try it on once?

101
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,330
Go ahead.

102
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,220
It's still here, the same as ever.

103
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,240
She's checking on the fake censer.

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,030
It's a good thing we made another fake censer.

105
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,210
Winter General must have the real censer, right?

106
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,610
It's a real shock that Winter General and his sister would betray us.

107
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,720
The censer has changed to give off a blue light.

108
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,090
As time passes and the censer's light turns to a blue color,

109
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,200
then that'll mean I've entered Sam Jang's body.

110
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,990
When that happens, break it.

111
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,560
If the censer is gone, then will Sam Jang be unable to come back again?

112
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,220
That's right. You have to make sure to break the censer.

113
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,490
Find Winter General. We have to find the censer at all cost.

114
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,530
He's probably hiding somewhere in the Middle Earth.

115
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,830
What are we going to do if he's already gotten rid of the censer?

116
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,960
If Sam Jang is sealed up somewhere where she can't come back from, then Ma Wang will feel it.

117
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,790
She's still safe for now.

118
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,050
It's in here.

119
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,620
She's still alive.

120
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,630
Hurry.

121
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,220
[I'll come for it, wait.]

122
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,620
What was that girl who came to my lecture hall?

123
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,440
Was it Jeong Se Ra whom I killed?

124
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,650
What are you doing?

125
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,410
That girl who didn't die and was roaming around?

126
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,110
Look here! Come to your senses! Look here!

127
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,530
I was told something strong, fearful, and dangerous was sealed up in there.

128
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,600
Did the thing that came out of here kill those men?

129
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,930
Sounds like crazy talk, right?

130
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,390
She told me to wait because she was going to come and get it.

131
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,680
She put the fear in me before leaving,

132
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,150
but I'm really excited by it and looking forward to it.

133
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,860
I feel like something extremely grand is about to show itself in front of this Kang Dae Seong.

134
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:40,140
When Sam Jang is back, I'm going to rip Ah Sa Nyeo to shreds.

135
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,170
I can feel your murderous intent all the way over here.

136
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,800
Hold yourself back if you want to get Sam Jang back safe and sound.

137
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,390
Isn't that right? Yes, indeed.

138
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,190
I really like the dress.

139
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,750
That's a relief.

140
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,580
I can't wait to see it.

141
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,700
Ah, I'll accompany you on your way out.

142
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,450
Do so please, Oh Jeong.

143
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,010
Instead of going, I want to stay here tonight.

144
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,320
Pardon?

145
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,490
Secretary Ma left because of Jeo Pal Gye's scheduled event, didn't she?

146
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,380
And Ma Wang is having a hard time because of his eyes right now, so I'll help you.

147
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,170
Oh, yes. I see.

148
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,640
All the better. Then come discuss the preparations for the wedding ceremony with me.

149
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
I'd like that.

150
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,250
See you later.

151
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,640
Hey, hey. She's completely determined on having you tonight. What are you going to do?

152
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
I've got no other choice.

153
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,720
Ma Wang, sleep with me.

154
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
I don't want to.

155
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,910
Tell her you have to hold me tight in your sleep because of your chill.

156
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,770
Hell no. Hell no to the max.

157
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,820
You can't see anyway! Just think of me as the Princess Iron Fan!

158
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,310
Have you lost it?! No way!

159
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,210
I even took ten hits for you, didn't I?!

160
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,590
I don't want to.

161
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,880
That's the only way!

162
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,490
- I can't sleep with her!
- Ow, ow!

163
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,620
Um, the wedding reception will be held in Sureumdong's garden.

164
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,360
If there's any particular food dish that you would like, please tell me.

165
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,610
I already told you everything before.

166
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,780
I've repeated myself 5 times now!

167
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:38,830
In that case, if there's a particular drink that you like, please tell me.

168
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,720
Decide on it yourself.

169
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm going back up now.

170
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,990
Hyungnim, I apologize.

171
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,880
This is as far as I can go.

172
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,810
Hey, she's coming. She's coming.

173
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:15,230
Ah! Goodness, the new groom was taking care of his skin but it looks like he's fallen asleep.

174
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,930
[Vaseline]

175
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,720
I was going to put one on too. Hold on just a moment.

176
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,920
Son Oh Gong? Nut job?

177
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,590
Oh my, looks like he's deep asleep already. Dear, dear.

178
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,620
Sam Jang, I'm truly grateful for you saying you'll stay behind like this to help me.

179
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,530
I'd like it if you could lead me to my room.

180
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,650
Now, now. Come, come.

181
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,520
Thanks, Ma Wang.

182
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:04,450
Sam Jang, we should talk about this or that regarding your wedding.

183
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,250
Let's do that here.

184
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,040
Come, come. Sit down.

185
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,640
All right. Let's do so then.

186
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,820
What did you want to talk about?

187
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,940
Ah! What would you like for your wedding gift?

188
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,580
I should give you something valuable.

189
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,390
Your wedding gift was the Pachoseon, right?

190
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,150
Give me something as valuable as that.

191
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,150
Elder Soo Bo Ri has the Pachoseon right now.

192
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,650
He'll return it after I become a deity.

193
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,190
Even though it's yours, you have to wait obediently for it to be given back to you?

194
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,460
For the sake of lessening my woman's pain,

195
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,660
I'm waiting obediently.

196
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,320
I see that the heavenly realm was able to quite easily tame you by inflicting pain on her.

197
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,040
You've become obedient and you've even gotten weak.

198
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,480
How bad for you.

199
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,140
I've gotten quite weak, haven't I?

200
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,760
The best treatment for it is right in front of my eyes though.

201
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,890
Will I become strong again if I just gobbled that up? Hm?

202
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,580
How dare you run your mouth, huh?!

203
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,560
Come out.

204
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,400
I said come out.

205
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,460
I'm leaving.

206
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,200
She probably caught on.

207
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,650
Catch her before she runs away.

208
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,720
I've been tamed, you say?

209
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,740
Wait!

210
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,010
Like I thought, you've been deceiving me.

211
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,820
I should have put up with it longer,

212
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,080
but I dislike you a pretty great deal.

213
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,760
I wonder what you're going to do to me now when you can't even bear to see me hurt?

214
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,230
Where's Sam Jang?

215
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm Sam Jang. She's gone.

216
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,360
She's been buried in my place in the sarcophagus I was locked up in.

217
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,810
That girl is dead.

218
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,980
Son Oh Gong!

219
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,980
She's still in me. She's definitely still alive!

220
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,690
Let her go.

221
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,330
If you act like this towards me again,

222
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,830
I'll make it so that this girl gets devoured by evil spirits.

223
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,520
You think I won't be able to?

224
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,380
Shall I try shedding some blood right here and now?

225
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,960
She might even end up being gobbled up by Ma Wang.

226
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,060
Should I give it a try?

227
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,330
Don't do it.

228
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,680
I can't beat you with my own strength.

229
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:04,860
However, I have the power to tear apart one body.

230
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,950
I was wrong.

231
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,560
Don't be like this. Don't hurt her.

232
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,540
Let's get married as planned.

233
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,090
A marriage is a contract.

234
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,510
I'm going to become your bride.

235
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,130
And from then on, you're going to be next to me.

236
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:48,170
Depending on how you act, I may even wake up that girl from the coffin for you.

237
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:54,430
After 100 years? 500 years? Will you be able to love me until then?

238
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,520
Who's to say?

239
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,570
I don't know how long it will last,

240
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,000
but the moment it ends, you'll die.

241
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,300
Then I guess I'll have to keep a hold on you for a good 1,000 years then.

242
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,500
Bye, now.

243
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,380
It's not going to take 1,000 years like it did for me.

244
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,030
We just need to find Winter General.

245
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,230
You withstood it well.

246
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,480
Ma Wang, you felt like this for 1,000 years?

247
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,770
That's right. I couldn't do anything,

248
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,880
and I endured the agony of not even knowing where or how she was.

249
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,490
That's how my 1,000 years were.

250
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,570
I can't even bear it for just one day.

251
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm going to find Winter General.

252
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:12,580
That stone-head monkey is feeling true pain now.

253
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,850
The punishment that the heavenly realm promised to inflict upon him is quite the success.

254
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,150
I feel bad for you, too.

255
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,200
I'm sorry.

256
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,300
She told me to get rid of this censer, but...

257
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,820
Are you really going to go through with the wedding?

258
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,410
Until I find Winter General, I have to do as she says.

259
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,990
Then I guess I won't need to get rid of the things I prepared.

260
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,460
What things?

261
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,650
Wow.

262
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,310
You prepared it so well it's hurting my heart.

263
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,490
I apologize, Hyungnim.

264
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,660
No, you did well. Sam Jang will really like it when she sees it.

265
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,170
Oh Jeong, you should get going to work already. I'm going to go to that girl.

266
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,860
What are you going to do once you're there?

267
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,410
What else? I have to torment her since she says she's in a good mood.

268
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:31,310
So that she can be in a bad mood, I'll have to go completely ruin it for her.

269
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,480
As expected, since you have a great figure, you look good in anything you wear.

270
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,550
From here to here.

271
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,060
Yes, Ma'am.

272
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,670
And from there to there.

273
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,650
You have a great eye for style.

274
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,880
I'll also wrap up the clothes and shoes you came here in, Ma'am.

275
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Just throw them away.

276
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,610
Yes, Ma'am. Is there anything else you need?

277
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,760
What do you think of these?

278
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,760
These aren't that great.

279
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,620
Right? I agree with you.

280
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,330
Those red ones over there.

281
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,910
Ah, yes, understood. I'll get you a new pair.

282
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,800
Thank you so much for your business, Ma'am. Would you like to pay by card?

283
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,600
I'll just take them and leave.

284
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,750
Yes, just leave then.

285
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,890
Ma'am! Just one moment please! Wait, please!

286
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,340
You need to pay before you go.

287
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,850
- I said I'm just going to leave.
- Excuse me?

288
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,500
You have to pay before you go.

289
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,760
I said I'm leaving.

290
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,690
So quickly pay up and then leave.

291
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,790
I don't have any money though.

292
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,260
If you don't have money then just give them here.

293
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,200
You should know better.

294
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,410
Where do you think you're going?

295
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,060
Take it all off, please.

296
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,600
Fine. Give me my clothes.

297
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
You told us to throw them away earlier, didn't you?

298
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,470
They're in the trash can over there.

299
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,190
So it was your doing.

300
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,680
Why do you look so shabby? It's so like you.

301
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,250
Even when Jin Seon Mi was dressed in rags, she looked pretty.

302
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
As for you...

303
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,310
I'm pretty sure I told you not to threaten me.

304
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,250
I'm not, I'm not.

305
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,210
I'm just watching you because you're pretty.

306
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm pretty?

307
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,580
You're not pretty! I lied.

308
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,570
Geez, you fell for that? You're really easy.

309
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,760
I didn't fall for it.

310
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,710
No, no. You fell for it and you're going to continue to fall for it.

311
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,720
You said you like me.

312
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,860
You said you wanted me.

313
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,280
Should I give myself to you?

314
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,100
I'm not going to! I lied! Just look at you! You fell for it again!

315
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
What are you doing?

316
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,110
Testing you.

317
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,160
I need to get to know you since we're going to be married.

318
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,360
See, surprisingly, I thought a bad guy and bad girl could live well together.

319
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,960
Do you think I'm lying?

320
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Do you think you might get fooled? Should I not keep going?

321
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,760
Continuing doing so. I'm fine with it.

322
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,600
What should I do? I'll try becoming someone that you'll like.

323
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,190
Is that so?

324
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,100
Then let's go to work.

325
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,990
The real estate office? Why would I go there?

326
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,090
You're going to because I'm going there.

327
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,310
[CEO Jin Seon Mi]

328
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,230
Even when she was busy catching evil spirits, she always came to work on time and did her job.

329
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,290
Do you think you'll be able to as well?

330
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,040
All of this body's memories

331
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,850
are still here.

332
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,490
Even the little details.

333
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,760
If you want me to, I can be exactly like that girl.

334
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,450
Exactly the same?

335
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,350
Son Oh Gong, normal office workers are busy at this hour.

336
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,760
Don't try any funny business and get out.

337
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,230
Hey, that really was really good. Keep going.

338
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,470
I'm starting to like you more and more.

339
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,860
I've come to like you, so give me a break.

340
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,690
Do you want me to continue?

341
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,600
All right. If you keep doing it so well like that,

342
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,850
I'll fall for it in the blink of an eye.

343
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,450
I can do it.

344
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,320
In the end, I'll be able to fool even your heart.

345
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,350
Deceiving and being deceived.

346
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,330
Like that, we can live well.

347
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,770
You know that well.

348
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,200
The bad guy and the bad girl fooling each other, it's very constructive.

349
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,580
Now it's up to you. Do a good job being the exact same.

350
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,720
Depending on how well you do, I'll let myself be fooled.

351
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,270
Good luck!

352
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,240
CEO, good morning! Huh?

353
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,340
What is it? Does something look different?

354
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,140
Why do you go around so shabby like that? So dirty.

355
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,560
There's something on your collar.

356
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,670
Wipe it off.

357
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,010
Thank you.

358
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,870
You're going to have to really hang in there today. We'll be super busy.

359
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,530
There's so much work to get done.

360
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,530
It'll be fine. I can do it.

361
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,260
CEO! How could you stamp the seal there? I'm so busy as it is!

362
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,200
Now I have to draft this again! Gosh, seriously.

363
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,660
Why are you so foolish today?

364
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,670
I know it all in my head. It's just because it's my first time doing it!

365
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,790
Are you speaking words right now or passing wind?

366
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,450
CEO, you've been doing this work for 10 years, 3 with me.

367
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,630
You're really weird today like an idiot.

368
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,340
I can do it well!

369
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,260
Don't just say empty words!

370
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,320
Use your eyes and properly look before doing it!

371
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,000
And tie your hair back. It keeps creating static.

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,670
I nearly got an electric shock!

373
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,270
I have re-draft all of these again. Ah, the stress...

374
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,610
How annoying!

375
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,890
CEO, your family is here.

376
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,790
Huh? Family?

377
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,220
I'm a nice ahjussi.

378
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,470
Secretary Son must have contacted them because you're getting married.

379
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,330
Have a nice talk. Let's go play with me.

380
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:34,850
Your aunt says she'll help you prepare the marriage gifts, so give her the money.

381
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,910
Deposit it to her checking account.

382
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,230
We've got good news too. A second baby is on the way.

383
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,000
Help us out with some money.

384
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,260
Seon Mi, congratulations!

385
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,480
He said Secretary Son contacted him and said that you were getting married.

386
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,460
It's a happy ending. Congratulations. Come here!

387
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:03,340
Jonathan! Good friend! You, big bowl. You are generous.

388
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,940
Together, congratulations. Drinking?

389
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,400
- Okay!
- Okay?

390
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,310
Drinks on me!

391
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,670
Okay! Drinking together! Party!

392
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,550
Oh, yeah! Party! I missed you! I missed you!

393
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,450
- Party! Drinking party!
- Party!

394
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,830
What now?

395
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,460
Uh, well, the boiler at our home exploded all of a sudden.

396
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,560
Secretary Son told us to come stay here. Thank you.

397
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,890
- Auntie!
- Auntie!

398
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,910
Hey, you're going to make your mom sad.

399
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,500
Let's go. Let's go.

400
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,690
Haphazardly searching for him is taking too much time.

401
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,050
No matter how much we call Winter General, he's not responding, right?

402
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,110
If he was intending to betray me, then of course he wouldn't come when called.

403
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,930
What about the Summer Fairy?

404
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,590
Summer Fairy was here when the censer disappeared.

405
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,480
As I thought, did those two plan this?

406
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,790
But something's still off.

407
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,570
Why did he insist on coming in as Winter General,

408
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,370
make the censer out of ice, and then leave?

409
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,490
Summer Fairy, too, should be more than capable of doing that much.

410
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,620
You're saying Winter General put Summer Fairy to sleep and did it by himself?

411
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,860
Ah, when Summer Fairy first came, it was definitely warm.

412
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,330
However, it got colder that night.

413
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:35,080
I thought it was because of my chill, but there's no doubt!

414
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,280
Winter General had come by and left.

415
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,890
That makes sense.

416
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,900
But Winter General, why are you awake when it's so late?

417
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,250
On the night I went to get Summer Fairy, Winter General was awake.

418
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,260
And the one that Ah Sa Nyeo met with was Winter General, too.

419
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,420
Is it possible Summer Fairy has nothing to do with this?

420
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,060
If Summer Fairy really has nothing to do with this,

421
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,370
then we need to call her.

422
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,620
If Winter General's been awake all this time,

423
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,300
then he should be really exhausted right now.

424
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,280
Summer Fairy, don't try to come out.

425
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,810
Brother, stop it now.

426
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,970
Don't try to come out. Just stay asleep.

427
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,970
You're going to destroy this whole place?

428
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,410
Yeah. I need to call Summer Fairy out.

429
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,220
Come.

430
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,040
If you don't want to die, then come!

431
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,130
He's calling me.

432
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,920
Don't answer him. Just stay obediently inside me.

433
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,370
I have to go!

434
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,230
You absolutely cannot move from here.

435
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,690
You can't! What are you doing?

436
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,290
Brother.

437
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:59,500
No. If you stay out of my body, you'll soon disappear.

438
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,350
Come back.

439
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,230
No!

440
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,350
Please, stop now!

441
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,470
It's Summer Fairy!

442
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm here.

443
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,710
You came out of Winter General's body?

444
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,190
Yes.

445
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,130
This is a place I cherished. Please don't destroy it.

446
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,150
You liked this place as well, didn't you, Great Sage?

447
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,250
Even though you couldn't drink.

448
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,100
Where's Winter General? What about the censer?

449
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,790
Summer Fairy's soul came out of Winter General.

450
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,290
We've found out where he is.

451
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,930
Son Oh Gong is going to kill Winter General.

452
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:31,440
I have to find Ah Sa Nyeo and have her put Summer Fairy's soul back in me.

453
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,030
Great Sage.

454
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,250
Hand over the censer.

455
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,990
I can't do that.

456
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,180
Winter General!

457
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,350
Sam Jang is a human that can harm you, Great Sage!

458
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,710
Getting rid of the censer is not considered betraying you.

459
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:03,590
Sam Jang is the person that will be my bride.

460
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,740
I need that censer to find my bride.

461
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,380
Don't come near. I need to protect my sister as well.

462
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:03,940
I... didn't want to kill you.

463
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,760
Stop, Brother!

464
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,980
You can't use your strength. Your soul won't be able to last.

465
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,350
Brother...

466
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,980
You musn't! Don't hold me!

467
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,230
Come back inside of me!

468
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,330
You mustn't do this.

469
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,450
I should have disappeared back then.

470
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,490
Thanks to you, Brother,

471
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,470
I've been able to live a good and enjoyable life until now.

472
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,970
Now, I'm going to leave.

473
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,320
No! You can't!

474
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,290
You can't.

475
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,070
Great Sage, please forgive him.

476
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:34,740
My death should be enough to pay the price for the crime.

477
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,020
Sister! My pretty sister!

478
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,310
Sister!

479
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm sorry. Go well.

480
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,900
Ma Wang, have your eyes gotten better?

481
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,150
I think I've received Summer Fairy's last gift.

482
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:27,480
Thanks to that heat wave earlier, my chill has gone away.

483
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,540
That's a relief.

484
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,160
When she put my sister's soul in me,

485
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,790
I made a contract with Ah Sa Nyeo.

486
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,440
Now that my sister's soul is gone,

487
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,680
that contract has also ended.

488
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,240
The censer's flame hasn't been put out yet.

489
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,960
Sam Jang should also still be alive,

490
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,190
so kill me and go save her.

491
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:13,070
Summer Fairy paid the price of your betrayal and left.

492
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,100
Winter General, stop crying.

493
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,540
You keep making it cold and snow.

494
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,190
I hate the cold.

495
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,540
I'm sorry.

496
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,220
Here, a pig. You're done drawing a pig, right?

497
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:47,720
Excuse me, CEO. The boiler still is not fixed.

498
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,480
Once it's fixed, we'll leave.

499
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,230
I can do it.

500
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,500
Yes, I can!

501
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,780
Show me the mystery apartment.

502
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,630
If you look at scary things at night, you'll pee yourself.

503
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,930
Oh? It's Professor Kang Dae Seong.

504
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,460
You keep getting asked to get involved in politics,

505
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,290
so are you going to go accept this time?

506
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,120
As someone who's studied history all these years,

507
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,250
I believe the politician of that era is created by the heart and mind of that generation.

508
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,630
Whenever I look at this guy, he's always handsome and cool.

509
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,580
Mystery apartment.

510
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,190
Han Byeol, you need to study hard as well

511
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,040
so that you can become a great person like this ahjussi.

512
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,800
He's not that great of a person.

513
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,000
But you were looking into land prices in Bicheon.

514
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,520
Kang Dae Seong won't become the president? Your intuition says he won't?

515
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,450
We need a great person

516
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:01,520
in order for my Han Byeol and Han Sol's world to become better.

517
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,290
A priestess that can crown a king?

518
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:18,080
It's a priestess's censer that was used for memorial ceremonies to call upon a dragon.

519
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,190
A dragon is the symbol of a king.

520
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,380
This dragon image was in the coffin as well.

521
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,890
Then it's possible that coffin belongs to that priestess.

522
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,960
Who are you?

523
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,980
I've come here to get Jin Seon Mi.

524
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,370
Son Oh Gong is asking for her.

525
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,090
Ah, Secretary Son? Okay. Come on in.

526
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,990
We're on our way out.

527
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,000
Han Byeol! Han Sol! If your things are all packed, then let's go!

528
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,470
Is he Secretary Son's father?

529
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,390
He seems familiar...

530
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,510
Oh! That's it!

531
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,160
That's it!

532
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,090
How can this be? The chairman? His son?

533
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,340
Oh. My. God.

534
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,760
He said he would come see me even if I don't call him, but he hasn't been around all day.

535
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,630
Instead you're here?

536
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,480
Hyungnim said he was watching over you the whole time.

537
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,000
He told me to bring you to Sureumdong.

538
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,310
Thank you for this. But what's with taking it and giving it back?

539
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:36,590
You'll be thankful if I give it back after taking it, and be upset for taking it back after giving it.

540
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,210
- You look pretty.
- I'm not going to fall for that.

541
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,660
By the way, what is all this?

542
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,180
Did you go so far as to prepare all this just to fool me?

543
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,230
Oh Jeong prepared all of it.

544
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,970
Don't like it. Since it's not for you.

545
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,910
- Then get rid of it.
- I won't.

546
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,380
I can still use it with you, can't I?

547
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,660
You said you wanted to get married, didn't you?

548
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,250
Drink up.

549
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,150
You think I'd drink this?

550
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,830
I know all about what you did to Ma Wang.

551
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,290
Is that so? This is a really good wine though.

552
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,090
Don't light those either.

553
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,810
These smell really good though. They're perfect for setting the mood.

554
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:47,390
Don't do anything. I'm not going to fall for it.

555
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,880
I didn't call you here to not do anything though.

556
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,090
All right. I won't do anything.

557
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,760
Then talk about yourself.

558
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,920
Why are you trying so hard to become Sam Jang?

559
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,320
I doubt it's because you want to become the CEO of Hanbit Real Estate.

560
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:35,030
Even in this world, I'm going to call a dragon again.

561
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,660
- What?
- And by doing so, I'll crown a king.

562
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,940
If you protect me by my side, I can do anything.

563
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,100
Ah Sa Nyeo's and Sam Jang's dreams are connected through this censer.

564
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,730
Sam Jang will still be in the dream, in a sleeping state.

565
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:09,410
Then if Ah Sa Nyeo also enters that dream, can we switch them back and bring her out?

566
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:14,060
Yes. She has to be put to sleep first.

567
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,310
Ah Sa Nyeo is on her guard right now.

568
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:22,900
She'll never let herself fall asleep next to Son Oh Gong.

569
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,570
I'll become the Sam Jang that you loved.

570
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,840
I can be the exact same as her.

571
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:38,890
You just need to stay by my side just as you are now.

572
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:44,300
Then what are you going to do for me?

573
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:49,710
I'll end the fate that rang the death bell.

574
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,220
So that's what it was. The reason Sam Jang isn't calling me.

575
00:53:54,220 --> 00:54:00,270
She was under such an absurd misconception, so I told her the proper truth.

576
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:06,750
That you and she aren't this kind of match made in heaven.

577
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:23,060
If she comes back, it's possible you'll die.

578
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,630
But even so, are you going to continue to wait for her?

579
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,070
No, I'm not going to wait.

580
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,810
You've made the right choice.

581
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,680
There are a lot of different ways to make a person take a drug.

582
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,030
What did you just give me?

583
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,620
A drug to make you dream a good dream.

584
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,790
I put it in the water I drank earlier.

585
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:50,330
You were talking so much I almost ate it all myself.

586
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,660
Have a nice dream.

587
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:58,860
And I'm going to make it so that you can never wake back up in this body.

588
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,890
- Did you put her to sleep well?
- Yeah.

589
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,810
How? It shouldn't have been easy.

590
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:22,260
Don't ask me how. The censer is burning well, right?

591
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,190
Yes.

592
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,590
Ah Sa Nyeo's and Sam Jang's dreams should be connected.

593
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,580
I have to go there.

594
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:46,060
Is there a way to enter that dream?

595
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,810
You can't go into someone else's dream without any connection to it.

596
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,980
I have a connection.

597
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,830
It will tell me where she is.

598
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,840
Jin Seon Mi, where are you right now?

599
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,240
Can you hear my voice?

600
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:53,090
Jin Seon Mi, where are you?

601
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,980
Jin Seon Mi!

602
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,740
I came back here again?

603
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,980
If the censer's flame is extinguished, their dreams will get separated.

604
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,990
Has the censer's flame been put out?

605
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,470
She's gone.

606
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,150
We've been disconnected.

607
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,440
I came to see you in your dream.

608
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,880
And Son Oh Gong is probably in Sam Jang's dream.

609
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,950
Jin Seon Mi.

610
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,490
I received a big help from you, so I didn't particularly have an issue with you.

611
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:44,030
However, you keep causing problems, so I'm left with no other choice.

612
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:53,250
You're going to have to go back into this coffin and sleep like a good girl.

613
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,330
- Just a moment
- No.

614
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:02,260
I don't feel like listening to your stories anymore.

615
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,700
You're being deceived by something, Ma Wang.

616
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,780
You're the one that's probably trying to deceive me!

617
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:10,610
Do you think the child Princess Iron Fan gave birth to really died?

618
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,320
Why didn't you call me?

619
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,190
Why are you here? Get out!

620
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,720
Don't come here! Don't come, Son Oh Gong!

621
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:45,890
I knew it. Because of me, you're hurting and are going to die.

622
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,210
She said it was a death bell!

623
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:56,460
It's horrifying. I'm not leaving from here.

624
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,050
I told you not to come near me!

625
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,020
Fine. Then try and kill me right here and now.

626
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,790
Son Oh Gong!

627
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,240
I'm begging you not to come.

628
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,660
Don't make me hurt you.

629
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:35,220
You told me that if I called your name when I'm scared, struggling, or in danger,

630
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,960
you would come to protect me.

631
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,010
Since I'm wearing this, I'll protect you.

632
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:58,320
Call my name when you're struggling, scared, or in danger.

633
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,210
I will always appear and protect you.

634
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,850
♫ I will close my two eyes ♫

635
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:07,700
♫ So that I won't see you ♫

636
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:15,480
♫ Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt ♫

637
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,690
Jin Seon Mi.
♫ And I'll grit my teeth like this ♫

638
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,370
Jin Seon Mi.
♫ I'll hold back my tears ♫

639
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,800
Jin Seon Mi!
♫  Don't worry ♫

640
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:33,370
♫ Please just go the way you were going ♫

641
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:40,770
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

642
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:50,290
♫ Here where I watch you going far away is my place ♫

643
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:57,970
♫ But then why do I only want to keep calling out to you ♫

644
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:05,620
♫ Why don't you turn around just once ♫

645
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,120
♫ Anyway, it's already been decided ♫

646
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,870
♫ Even though I knew this would be farewell ♫

647
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:18,530
♫ Why am I like this ♫

648
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,630
You're awake.

649
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,650
Thank goodness.

650
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,890
Are you okay?

651
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,600
Yeah.

652
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,890
I finally found my bride,

653
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:01,120
but I'm so sleepy right now.

654
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,300
I'm sorry.

655
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,220
It's Ah Sa Nyeo's censer.

656
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:48,030
Why don't you keep it at the general store?

657
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:51,990
As always, you're the only one I can count on, Ma Wang.

658
01:05:52,990 --> 01:06:00,860
Yes, of course. I do things very obediently, don't I?

659
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:06,150
Did you do a good job taking care of Ah Sa Nyeo?

660
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,380
I lost her.

661
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:15,120
I've gotten very weak, you see.

662
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,170
Bu Ja won't be able to wake up for eternity, right?

663
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:31,060
When Ma Wang comes, he's going to burn her.

664
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,110
You're awake?!

665
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,970
Bu Ja!

666
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,250
Jeo Pal Gye,

667
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,310
please save me.

668
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,750
Ah, we're going to leave first.

669
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:10,260
Why is he just leaving without staying to watch Bu Ja get burned?

670
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:33,210
What's the meaning of this?

671
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,060
The pig ran off with Bu Ja.

672
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,800
Jeo Pal Gye's at it again!

673
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,840
Why are you getting off? You said you wanted to see your mom!

674
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,260
I changed my mind.

675
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,630
Thank you for helping me.

676
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,990
You tricked me again, didn't you? You're just Ah Sa Nyeo, aren't you?

677
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:49,080
And so? Are you going to drag me back to be burned?

678
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:59,410
Don't come out and stay hidden.

679
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,680
Don't let yourself get caught.

680
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:07,350
You really did love and cherish her.

681
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,320
Leave.

682
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,620
It's good that I'm able to use him.

683
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:41,090
Shall I go to that person now?

684
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,660
I see you've been storing it well.

685
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,380
As promised, I came to find it.

686
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:39,090
I was waiting for you.

687
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,100
Pal Gye let Ah Sa Nyeo free.

688
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,230
I apologize.

689
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,720
It's fine. I'm the one who let her go.

690
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:07,000
That girl gave me a huge revelation.

691
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:14,650
Do you think the child Princess Iron Fan gave birth to really died?

692
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,110
The child died.

693
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:21,290
A child who was born of a deity and a demon and consumed the souls of tens of human children...

694
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:23,910
do you think the child really would have died?

695
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:29,390
What are you trying to say right now?

696
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:34,280
Because the child died, the woman committed a crime.

697
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,000
And in order to end the punishment for that,

698
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,260
you lived an obedient life for 1,000 years.

699
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,070
Try thinking about it in reverse.

700
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:48,330
And if that makes sense to you, let me go.

701
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,040
In order to tame me to be obedient,

702
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,720
that woman committed a crime, and for the sake of that crime,

703
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:59,490
my child was killed.

704
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,300
Why did I never think of that before?

705
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,730
Don't fall too hard for what Ah Sa Nyeo tells you.

706
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,950
If I was actually deceived, then they're all my enemies.

707
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,060
After coming for the bride,

708
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,850
the groom keeps sleeping.

709
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:43,790
The human Jin Seon Mi... loves the Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage.

710
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,930
And now...

711
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,060
I'm going to end your love.

712
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,570
♫ Don't say anything ♫

713
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:25,160
♫ This moment we are together ♫

714
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,160
♫ Don't try to escape ♫

715
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,530
♫ Because this is love's destiny ♫

716
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:38,360
♫ Inside my unknowing heart ♫

717
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,080
♫ I'm sorry, I believe you ♫

718
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:49,790
♫ I will be with you forever as I was destined to be ♫

719
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:52,400
[Hwayugi]

720
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,150
She said that when she was in Sam Jang's body.

721
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:56,590
Did she choose that person?

722
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,990
About what I am... have I answered it somewhat?

723
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,310
You said Ma Wang let you go?

724
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,790
Did the child die for sure?

725
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:09,580
It's the sword to be used on that day.

726
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,820
- Is that it?
- It's not something that you should have yet.

727
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,940
Don't end up like me.

728
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,910
Let's go and hear about your beginnings.
