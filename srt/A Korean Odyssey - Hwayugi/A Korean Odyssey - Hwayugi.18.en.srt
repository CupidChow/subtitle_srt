4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,390
What are you trying to do by criticizing me yet telling me that you'll help me?
[Episode 18]

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,540
Are you playing around?

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,060
You're taking your joke too far.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,550
I am playing around, but I'm not joking around.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm not in a situation where I'd make a joke.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,850
Then you're saying you'll actually help me?

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,530
I will provide you with money and power.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,720
So gather people who are just like you.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,680
Without caring about how bad you are,

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,870
out of their blindness for money and attachment for power,

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,460
people who will lift you up and try to put you at the top of the world.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,850
You and those people will summon something that I want.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,900
So you're saying for me to get to the top

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,090
and offer up what you want, huh?

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,140
So it's a deal of sorts.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,260
A deal?

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Then let's talk in detail

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,810
about what I need and what it is that you want.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,590
Now.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,170
I don't have time, so I need to get going.

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,360
I have to go watch My Golden Life.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,100
I've been too busy to watch Yoon's Kitchen too, so I have to watch reruns.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,970
What you need, just tell that person over there.

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,030
I will call you when I need you. Come running then.

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,470
It's a bit offensive.

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,190
If you want to make a deal, shouldn't you at least

30
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,300
show some respect toward the other?

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,880
How am I supposed to trust you like this?

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,610
Consider me not as someone who's making a deal with you

33
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,220
but as an absolute power who will guide you.

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,310
Are you a god or something?

35
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,160
Hey, it's so obvious what kind of world you will make,

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,540
so if I was a god, would I be helping you?

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,250
Consider me as a devil, then you should be able to put your trust in me well.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,700
My bull.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,920
You've just become a clothes hanger.

40
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,320
Oh, you're here, Ma Wang?

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,730
Hey.

42
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,170
Change the way you watch TV.

43
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,340
Because you always watch lying down like this,

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,860
- the expensive sofa is all sagging!
- Yeah.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,990
You never listen to a thing I say.

46
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,430
I'll just have to throw this sofa out or something.

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,570
I saw you got a monthly TV subscription for reruns. I love it.

48
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,890
Do you know how much you spent on watching each show individually?

49
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,140
If I added up all they cost me, I could have bought 12 of those sofas.

50
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,150
You should have gotten a monthly subscription sooner. You have to save to live well.

51
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,240
The one who said he hung up a painting worth 10 billion won in the bathroom

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,390
sure saves a lot of money. I'm wasting my breath by talking.

53
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,930
I'll give it to you later. Take it.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,970
The alcohol in Sureumdong, feel free take them all and drink them as well.

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,990
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,230
You said you're even prepared to die so did something

57
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,350
happen where you are going to die?

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,050
The evil spirit that Sam Jang has to face.

59
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,030
I found out what it is.

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,540
What is it?

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,980
The thing Ah Sa Nyeo will summon.

62
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,740
The thing that Ah Sa Nyeo will summon...

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,070
Dragon? How can a dragon be an evil spirit? It's a divine being.

64
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a black dragon.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,740
The dragon that's going to be summoned this time is a huge, black dragon.

66
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,620
The Great Sage found out about it.

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,410
All the evil spirits overflowing in the world have gathered together

68
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,470
and changed the divine being into an evil spirit.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,580
If a black dragon comes out into the world and chooses an evil person as its master,

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,670
the disarrangement of the world which Sam Jang saw ahead of time will come.

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,800
So in order to summon it, you needed Ah Sa Nyeo.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,250
I've found the human whom the black dragon will choose, too.

73
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,610
- Kang Dae Seong?
- When Ah Sa Nyeo summons the dragon for Kang Dae Seong,

74
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,760
I will get rid of it before it comes out into the world.

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,910
Hey, it's a black dragon. It's extremely strong.

76
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,910
If you get into a fight with it without precaution, even if you're a piece of rock,

77
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,430
your body will shatter to pieces.

78
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,380
Is a dragon that strong? Have you faced off against one?

79
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,600
You have?

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,870
Did perhaps you lose?

81
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,410
Well, it's not that I lost.

82
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,160
We respectfully recognized each other's strength

83
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,730
and retreated.

84
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,960
It's obvious you were afraid since you knew you would lose, so you retreated.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,740
But if it's something that the old you were afraid to go up against,

86
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,530
I guess it must be really strong.

87
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,270
Its two blood red eyes which I saw 3,200 years ago,

88
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,020
I still see them in my dreams once in a while.

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,680
You could really die.

90
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,330
You think?

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,890
If Secretary Ma brings any good medicine, share it with me.

92
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,880
So that I can grow my strength.

93
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,090
But there's a rather simple solution.

94
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,830
Use Sam Jang.

95
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,180
Her fate has already been decided anyway.

96
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,170
Contain the dragon using Sam Jang as a bowl. Then you can strike it with the sword you were handed.

97
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,700
Is she some kind of a container? Why do you keep telling me to contain something in her?

98
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,640
This bracelet is the reason you can't do it.

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,450
Even if it meant that you have to cut off your wrist,

100
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,540
once we get rid of this, you will be able to do it.

101
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,690
Then try it.

102
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,080
What?

103
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,300
Cut it off nicely, right about here.

104
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,150
You're serious?

105
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,700
Let's give it a try and see

106
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,500
if getting rid of this will really get rid of my feelings as well.

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,260
You really want to do this?

108
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,070
Promise me not to go, "Oh!" in the middle of it, okay?

109
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,980
You think that even if I cut it off,

110
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,960
nothing will change, right?

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,990
I am desperately hoping for that.

112
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,990
Let's stop now.

113
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,860
Why cut off a perfectly good hand when there is nothing certain?

114
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,330
Fine. Fight against the dragon and get broken into pieces.

115
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,600
If even a wrist remains, I will bury it well.

116
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,350
I'll be living elsewhere for the time being.

117
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,580
Even if you get bored, endure it.

118
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,890
I'm glad I got a monthly subscription.

119
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,490
If I had gotten an annual subscription, there would be no one to watch it.

120
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,710
It would have been such a waste.

121
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,430
Son Oh Gong.

122
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,430
She called.

123
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,470
It's been quite a long time since you called my name.

124
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,150
I don't see any danger, so did you call me as a substitute driver?

125
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,020
I called you to do something for me.

126
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,680
Put this thing way up there in the sky among the other stars.

127
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,570
- This thing?
- You can't? You've always been bragging about how you'll do everything for me.

128
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,660
But you can't even do something as simple as that?

129
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,080
I did it. Confirm it when you go out later.

130
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,280
Liar.

131
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,700
There is something I can do, too. Want to see?

132
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,660
It's cool,

133
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,060
but let's just use our hands to ladle the soup.

134
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,570
That's too ordinary.

135
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,240
Son Oh Gong, I like eel.

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,970
You can make a mountain out of eels, right?

137
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,250
And with the fish cake broth, you can make an ocean, right?

138
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,670
If you ask me to, I will try it,

139
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,800
but is the place you want to live in anju (snacks eaten with alcohol) land?

140
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,610
Anju land sounds good.

141
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,010
Roast chickens flying around and pigs' feet walking around everywhere.

142
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,180
You have a lot of alcohol in Sureumdong,

143
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,010
so should we make that into an anju land and live there together?

144
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,050
Until we drink all the alcohol there

145
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,530
and finish up all the anju,

146
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,400
I wish I could live there with you.

147
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:27,430
To be honest, I didn't dislike you even when you chased me around to eat me.

148
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,680
Would a handsome guy like him really eat me?

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,200
I thought that, too.

150
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,040
Ever since you followed me around, telling me you love me,

151
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,480
I have been going out of my mind

152
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,170
because I was way too happy.

153
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,930
I liked the ice cream we ate together,

154
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,830
and the cotton candy was sweet,

155
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,650
and deokbokki was happiness to me.

156
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,590
When the Geumganggo disappears,

157
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,860
you said we can't see each other again, didn't you?

158
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,170
What should I do?

159
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,950
I like you so, so much.

160
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,980
♫ Please just go the way you were going ♫

161
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:48,630
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

162
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:57,860
♫ Even though I knew this would be farewell ♫

163
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,730
♫ Why am I like this ♫

164
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,300
This time, a very powerful person decided to

165
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,260
put his support behind me.

166
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,290
Really?

167
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,230
If you get rid of my obstacles and he opens the path up for me,

168
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll be able to go up to the highest peak this time.

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,700
I did what you wanted,

170
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,690
but too many people died around you.

171
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,360
Don't you think people would be suspicious?

172
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,040
Who would know? It wasn't done by a human.

173
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,890
But you know. Are you really okay with it?

174
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,800
What needed to be done was done. That's all.

175
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,000
Just tell me about the ritual you said you would have here.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,400
I'll prepare whatever you need.

177
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,910
Fine.

178
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,610
Why are you going to help summon the dragon for Kang Dae Seong?

179
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,890
Because I'm going to catch it and get rid of it.

180
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,060
A dragon is a divine being.

181
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,770
You think what comes out of here is something decent?

182
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,720
Sam Jang is stronger than you as I thought.

183
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,680
Even without seeing it herself,

184
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,840
she knew how wicked this place is.

185
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,580
Wicked?

186
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,940
The dragon that comes out of here is not a divine being but an evil spirit.

187
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,970
It's the darkest of the dark.

188
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,720
It's a black dragon? There's no way.

189
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,180
The dragon I summoned radiated golden light.

190
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,720
He betrayed me in the end, but the person who became a king from the dragon

191
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,960
gained power and had a peaceful reign.

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,500
But that was you in the past, and now you're an evil spirit.

193
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,550
That's why you don't even sense the wicked energy filling up this place.

194
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,790
Since it's just like you.

195
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,260
You still think you went and found Kang Dae Seong yourself, right?

196
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,730
No. That evil man Kang Dae Seong

197
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,680
drew you, the evil spirit, to him.

198
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,160
He killed Jeong Se Ra.

199
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,800
That's why I came to him.

200
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,830
Son Oh Gong was right.

201
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,290
That's right.

202
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,100
Whether it's people or machines, we all die.

203
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,780
CEO.

204
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,060
You drank yesterday, right?

205
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,410
How did you...

206
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,220
The hangover soup is here.

207
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,180
Here.

208
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,390
Secretary Son, no, Chairman Son, no...

209
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,660
the Mansour (indicates vast wealth) Son called this morning.

210
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,510
And he wanted to know what you would like as a hangover soup.

211
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,640
He asked me, so I said you would like beansprout soup for hangover soup,

212
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,420
and he had M Group's breakfast staff send this over.

213
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,580
Really?

214
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,330
But Mansour Son still doesn't seem to be quick on the uptake.

215
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,900
If he was going to send it over,

216
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,310
he should have sent two portions when there's two of us.

217
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,790
You have it.

218
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,430
Me?

219
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,600
I just said it without meaning anything by it.

220
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,890
Mansour Son sent it for the sake of your health, so you should enjoy it.

221
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,370
I'll have a sip for a taste, though. Sit down. Sit.

222
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,350
He used to bring you ice cream only.

223
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,370
But he improved. It was so bad that when I see ice cream,

224
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,230
I think of Mansour Son first instead of my kids.

225
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,750
I told you I'd get everything you like for you.

226
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,460
Strawberry ice cream, green, a movie,

227
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,350
and me.

228
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,760
Now I won't be able to eat ice cream anymore either.

229
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,950
I like this cotton ball. It's good.

230
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,890
- Is it good?
- It's spicy.

231
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,770
Cotton candy, too...

232
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,870
Or deokbokki either...

233
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,390
Oh, CEO, why are you crying instead of eating?

234
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,050
I won't take your food.

235
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,430
C- CEO...

236
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,580
The tone of the voice just changes.

237
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,900
Oh, really?

238
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,630
Jeez, what is that?

239
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,780
It's nice not having anyone disturbing me on my day off.

240
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,690
Because of that piece of rock rascal, the sofa is totally sagging.

241
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,640
Should I go clean my bull?

242
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,760
The rascal who made you into a clothes hanger won't be around soon.

243
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,850
Aren't you happy?

244
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,650
It's so boring since he's not around to annoy me.

245
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,200
If this kid is gone,

246
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,520
will that disappear, too?

247
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,710
If only the bull is here, it'll feel a little empty.

248
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,800
Are you home?!

249
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,700
It's you, Secretary Ma.

250
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,050
I thought you'd be alone, so I brought you food.

251
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,560
Yes. Leave it in the kitchen.

252
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,720
Were you cleaning it?

253
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
Well, I was cleaning my bull anyway, so ...

254
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
The monkey statue fit in well here.

255
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,890
Once it's gone, it'll feel a bit empty.

256
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,690
Right? Huh? It would be better to leave this here even if it's an eye sore, right?

257
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't like it that much, but for the sake of the interior design,

258
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,200
let's try to save the monkey, huh?

259
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,810
- Is the peddler not here?
- No.

260
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,060
It's a relief she's not here.

261
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,180
That kid will give you whatever you want in exchange for cash without a receipt.

262
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,190
Did you come looking for some kind of medicine again?

263
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,820
- I heard you found the medicine for me.
- Yes.

264
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,320
The side effect is severe. Don't sell it anymore.

265
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,480
Did you come to ban the medicine?

266
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,100
There's something I'm looking for.

267
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,900
Are there any more Geumganggo here?

268
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,060
This is an older model of the Geumganggo. You wear it on your head,

269
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,970
and if you don't obey the one who put it on your head, it gives you pain.

270
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,130
But since the basic idea is supposed to be similar,

271
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,810
maybe we'll be able to figure out how to unfasten the Geumganggo.

272
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,210
Then I'll put it on.

273
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,240
No. It's too dangerous for you.

274
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,340
I'll do it, and if anything seems strange, take it off me.

275
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,600
Will you be okay?

276
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,070
Here. Go put it on.

277
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,630
Oh dear. Look at this. Oh, oh.

278
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,310
Okay, it's activated.

279
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,730
Doesn't it hurt?

280
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,300
Not at all. Now you give me an order.

281
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,360
How can I give you an order?

282
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,620
That's an order. Give an order.

283
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,950
Then raise your right hand, Ma Wang.

284
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,030
I won't. I'm going to raise my left hand.

285
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,240
Are you okay?

286
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,030
This is quite painful.

287
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,470
Does the rascal feel this much pain, too? Do it once more.

288
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,930
Excuse me, would you please walk?

289
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm going to run.

290
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,200
Oh, it hurts. It hurts.

291
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,060
I can't take it off. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

292
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,650
Ma Wang, please stop.

293
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't do it. Don't.

294
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,140
Ma Wang.

295
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,520
Secretary Ma, take take take take take take it off please.

296
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,870
- Yes, yes.
- Please take it off. I beg you.

297
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,650
It hurts enough to make my eyes pop put.

298
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,570
I am sorry.

299
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,110
By my power alone, I wouldn't be able to unfasten it.

300
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,770
If that is so, the Great Sage will never break free from the power of the Geumganggo and will die.

301
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,190
Hey, Secretary Ma. You try it on once.

302
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,860
Yes.

303
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,290
That's it. Right.

304
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,700
- It's activated.
- Secretary Ma, raise your right hand.

305
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,080
Yes.

306
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,320
- You should raise your left hand, not your right.
- Yes.

307
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,420
"Yes?" I'm saying do the reverse, the reverse.

308
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,280
Instead of obeying, you should respond with the opposite.

309
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,450
Yes, I understand.

310
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,720
Sit down.

311
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm sorry. I'm not used to disobeying your orders.

312
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:38,010
I order you to disobey my order which says to obey my order.

313
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,340
Sit.

314
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,410
I don't know what to do.

315
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,930
Secretary Ma, if you keep on doing that, we can't test it.

316
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,760
I'm sorry. Huh?

317
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,570
How did it fall off?

318
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,310
It fell off by itself.

319
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,750
What's happening? Is it already broken?

320
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,180
- Try it on once more.
- Yes.

321
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,630
Oh, this is broken. Broken, huh?

322
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,980
That grandson sold me a defective item again. That little ...

323
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,110
Although I can wake the dragon with my own power,

324
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,550
I can't call him out of the world. I need Sam Jang.

325
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,410
Before it comes out, I'm going to get rid of it. She's not going to do anything.

326
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,370
You just need to do as much as you can.

327
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,890
Are you saying we should do it without her knowing about it?

328
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,290
That's how it will be. You do it all. That's why I spared your life.

329
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,990
I didn't spare your life because I like you, so don't think about talking nonsense.

330
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,890
I won't. You're saying that you're going to deceive your woman and work in secret with me, just the two of us.

331
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,160
I like that.

332
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,900
It's exciting to be meeting secretly. I won't get caught.

333
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,300
Be careful not to get caught. Leave.

334
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,970
I heard from Sa Oh Jeong that you left home too.

335
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,880
Are you staying at the penthouse of this building?

336
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,430
Why? Do you want to go up there?

337
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,570
I'd like that.

338
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,010
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

339
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,380
- Did you lie there thinking about that for 1,200 years?
- What?

340
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,000
Unless you only thought about that consistently for 1,200 years to the point that it became a grudge,

341
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,370
I wonder how else you could be so insistent in flirting with me. That's all.

342
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,050
- That's not so.
- Isn't it? Then did you think about other things as well?

343
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,900
I said it's not so.

344
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,790
Not thinking about anything else for 1,200 years, how many days is that...

345
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:45,110
Wait... what... thirty... Wow, I can't even calculate it.

346
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,050
To resolve that much resentment and sorrow, how many times will you have to do... Wait...

347
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,710
You're going to be very busy.

348
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,130
It's not about that.

349
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,900
For that long, I've been wanting a partner who would be beside me forever.

350
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,900
Because I was lonely.

351
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,300
So, what ... are you saying the reason you became an evil spirit was because you were lonely?

352
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,260
Then you should have chosen someone who wouldn't make you lonely.

353
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,800
You chose the wrong person.

354
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,110
See, I have no intention of resolving an evil spirit's resentment and sorrow.

355
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,740
I'm a priestess, not the likes of an evil spirit!

356
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,540
Are you alright, CEO?

357
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,230
Yes. I'm sorry.

358
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,860
I made myself look ridiculous in front of you.

359
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,860
Thinking about your mood today, I wasn't going to bring this up, but...

360
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,290
this is such a big deal that...

361
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,990
What is it?

[Hanbit Real Estate - CEO's Office]

363
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,430
Did you buy that piece of land in Bicheon City?

364
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,920
- Why do you ask?
- I think Kang Dae Seong is going to win.

365
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,420
The party leader of the party Kang Dae Seong joined died a few days ago.

366
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,610
It's a given that it's going to be Kang Dae Seong now.

367
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,900
You bought that land, right?

368
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,740
I see. A person around Kang Dae Seong died.

369
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,120
He comes from a great family, is capable, and young.

Oh, that's right! When we got in that accident you got his business card, right?

373
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,530
He said to contact him.

- Yes, of course.

Long time no see.

What have you been doing by that person's side?

384
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,070
Something you don't need to know.

385
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,870
You sent an evil spirit and hurt someone, didn't you?

386
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,820
And that's how you killed the person around him, isn't it?

387
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,830
Why do you keep asking me things I won't answer?

Why did you go to that person's side?

This body isn't hers anymore.

- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

and help the person that killed her?

403
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,990
You truly are a filthy rotten evil spirit.

The car's fine.

I wanted to come see one more time what kind of person you are.

Since I understand everything now, it's fine.

As you've said, I've gotten stronger now.

What is this?

414
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,230
You said she was someone I need, but she seems even stronger than you.

We don't need her.

We met at the General Store, right?

Your head hurting means that you're coming to realize the things you need to know.

You were the one that called me to come see the vision in the bad omen jar, weren't you?

What do I need to do?

424
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,760
You only need to empty yourself of what's precious to you.

425
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,780
Something precious to me?

426
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,970
It's not something any human could do.

427
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,070
Because you are Sam Jang, you should be able to.

428
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,850
At the General Store I bought another Geumganggo.

429
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,040
This is an older model.

430
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,780
What is this? Do you wear this on your head?

431
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,350
What a horror I almost would have gone through if I had to wear this.

432
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,870
I belatedly thank you, Ma Wang, for getting the upgraded version.

433
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,090
Don't thank me.

434
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,860
That thing's defective. Secretary Ma tried wearing it, but it fell right off.

435
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,560
I feel bad for buying a non-defective item for you.

436
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,400
Can one of these be defective?

437
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,980
Hey, does yours not come off at all?

438
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,440
In the beginning, I've tried using soap and held it under hot water to pull it off.

439
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,550
I've even tried banging it on a rock, but it wouldn't come off.

440
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,600
And now, I don't want to take it off.

441
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,490
You need to think this through.

442
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,830
What if you see Sam Jang after it comes off,

443
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,340
and you think, "Who is this? She's not my style. She's really ugly."

444
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,150
If that happens, it would be so unfair!

445
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,710
Shouldn't you make up your mind up to die after making sure first?

446
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,480
Why? You want me to stay alive?

447
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,760
- Ma Wang, do you love me?
- Gosh, this nut job.

448
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,050
Hey, it's because it makes me uncomfortable, that's all.

449
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,380
Because of me, a thug like you deciding to die

450
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,050
over love really doesn't sit right with me.

451
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,270
It's herbal medicine Secretary Ma obtained. Shove it in your mouth.

452
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,350
What's with you?

453
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,520
Tell your dog secretary thanks. I'll eat it well.

454
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,740
This is defective. Give me a refund.

455
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,720
I don't have any money. I spent it all on in-game purchases.

456
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,680
You spent all that in such a short amount of time?

457
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,610
I give you a pass for your gutsiness.

458
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,710
There are no defectives at our store. Try it again.

459
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,590
I told you it doesn't work.

460
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,100
You try wearing it then.

461
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,420
I don't want to.

462
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,930
Then hand me my money.

463
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:17,410
Huh? Come on.

464
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,110
Make sure you take it off for me quickly, okay?

465
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,910
Oh? Oh?

466
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,430
Tell me how to get the Geumganggo off Son Oh Gong.

467
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,250
I don't know that.

468
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,210
See? That's defective. Give me my money back.

469
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,340
I don't have the money, I used it all— Ouch!

470
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,410
- It works?
- Take it off quickly!

471
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,220
You, where did you hide the money?

472
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,560
I don't know— Ouch! Ow!

473
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,870
It's inside that jar.

474

Oh, this kid...

475
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,510
So this does work, huh?

476
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,770
Hey, why do you whine so much? It didn't hurt that much.

477
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,570
It hurt so much that my eyes nearly popped out.

478
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,300
Since it works again, I'll take it with me.

Ah, seriously.

- Ahjussi?
- What about it?

482

There are no demons who call me Ahjussi.

Ah, it's Ma Wang, right?

Can't I call you Ahjussi anyway?

485
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,250
Fine, just call me Ahjussi.

Take care. And stop stealing.

487
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,850
Ah, seriously. I was told that I wasn't just a demon.

488
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,550
I was told that I was half deity.

489

It's a place my sister treasured.

Son Oh Gong called me here.

You're aware, right? That we are now on the same side.

494

I know.

495

There's a lot to talk about. When will he come?

496
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,720
The Great Sage won't come.

497
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,490
He told me to relay to him what I hear from you.

498
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,550
I was going to tell him about meeting Sam Jang.

499

What should I say?

500

Why are you giving me water in this cup when you have so many other cups?

501

All the things you see here are things my sister treasured.

I don't want you touching them.

She said there are things needed for the ritual to summon the dragon.

504
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,130
They were placed at the altar during the ritual a long time ago.

505
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,360
They are things which symbolize the subjects who revered their king.

506
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,810
A rock which lights the world,

507
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,060
a bell which rings throughout the world,

508
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,480
and a sword that rules the world.

509
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,490
These three things.

510
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,620
In this world, they would be scholars, journalists, and those involved with the law.

511
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,380
Those who revere their king, I'm curious to see who they are.

512
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:09,750
There soon will be a centennial celebration of Kang Dae Seong's Korea Foundation.

513
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,310
If you go to the banquet where all the consular representatives gather, you should be able to see.

514
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,500
But, you know, what would those subjects

515
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,630
do when it's revealed to the world how bad Kang Dae Seong is?

516
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,200
Will they still come to his banquet?

517
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,510
The centennial celebratory cultural event will be held here.

518
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,960
Your ritual will close out the event.

519
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,130
Will I be able to see the dragon then?

520
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,290
Ordinary people can't see it.

521
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,590
They'll probably think it's the wind or the clouds.

522
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:57,090
It's a shame. I would like to see the dragon that will choose me.

523
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,990
We need a door for the dragon to come through into this world.

524
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,690
You said to put up a stone gate here, right?

It shouldn't be too hard.

News?

We've uncovered a record that a person who's known to be the great-grandfather of

529
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,940
Professor Kang Dae Seong, the founder of Korea Foundation which is about to celebrate its centennial,

530
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,320
was awarded a Medal of Honor from the Emperor of Japan.

Is it true that your great-grandfather received a Medal of Honor from a Japanese emperor?

Is the disappearance of the museum director related to this?

People are asking for an investigation into the suspicion.

541
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,080
That's right. It's only a suspicion at this point,

542
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,850
so we just have to make sure no one talks about it for too long.

will the black dragon disappear?

Are those people Kang Dae Seong's stone, bell, and sword?

632
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,990
I thought that if we got rid of that man, the black dragon will disappear, too.

633
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,930
I guess not.

634
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,830
Even if Kang Dae Seong disappears,

635
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:22,570
they will find another Kang Dae Seong to put in his place,

636
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,250
and through that person,

637
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,760
the black dragon will surely come out into the world again.

638
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,490
Since there are plenty of evil people in the world for the black dragon to choose from.

639
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,400
I've seen enough. Let's go.

640
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,890
Damn.

641
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,400
I can't go.

642
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,030
Is something wrong?

643
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,830
Sam Jang just arrived.

644
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,040
I see.

645
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,560
I smell the lotus scent.

646
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,460
I didn't expect to see you here, Jin Seon Mi.

647
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,710
She came in Chairman Woo Hwi's place.

648
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,250
Is that so?

649
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,490
Please excuse me for a moment.

650
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,560
Why did you bring her here?

651
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,900
Ma Wang told me to tell you.

652
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,330
Sam Jang is looking for the evil spirit herself.

653
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,110
He said it will be hard to keep it a secret any longer.

654
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,330
Is there a valley with a huge cliff that's connected to a river in Bicheon?

655
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,330
Why are you so curious about that place?

656
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:51,820
I'm looking to buy it. I'm in real estate.

657
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,130
You want to buy a valley?

658
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,590
- That's my family—
- Hey.

659
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,940
Go see Chairman Yoon Dae Sik right now.

660
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,130
Sure. Let's talk about this another time.

661
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,240
You want to buy land? Are you doing business as the CEO of Hanbit Real Estate?

662
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,650
Yes. I want to go find the place I saw.

663
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,080
You heard from Winter General that I had a vision of a strange valley, right?

664
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,440
That person, to Bu Ja—

665
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,100
No, he killed Jeong Se Ra.

666
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,130
That was the start of it.

667
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,600
That guy killed Jeong Se Ra, and then you made her into Bu Ja.

668
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,910
And then the evil spirit of Ah Sa Nyeo took her over.

669
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,800
That bastard really attracted evil spirits to himself.

670
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,370
The evil person I was looking for is Kang Dae Seong.

671
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,990
The evil spirit which will possess that bastard

672
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:08,110
will come out of the valley that you saw.

673
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,100
In order to catch it, I'm waiting.

674
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,100
So I found the right thing.

675
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,740
I keep telling you, but it really wasn't me who was crying before.

676
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,950
I know. I know, I know.

677
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,860
Why? You think I put something in there?

678
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,740
I don't do petty things like the monkey.

679
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,530
And with Bu Ja inside you, would I really hurt you?

680
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,450
Eat this with it.

681
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,280
That wine goes well with the cheese.

682
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,010
I heard you bewitch women with your powers, but I won't fall for you.

683
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:03,470
I can't do that right now.

684
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,680
This isn't tasty at all.

685
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,780
You said you were a priestess, right?

686
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,290
My status was as high as a king.

687
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:20,870
You're actually not at the level to be having a drink with me.

688
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,830
PK, thank you for your patronage.

689
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:26,830
Are you enjoying the wine?

690
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,180
Yes, thank you.

691
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,730
Would you like some more cheese?

692
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,030
Well, about that, my friend doesn't think too highly of it.

693
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:38,790
Is that so? I shall provide you with something else then.

694
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,810
In the past, too, they all prostrated themselves to me like that.

695
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:57,090
Great Priestess, would you please clink glasses with this lowly pig?

696
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,930
Yes, I will give you permission to toast.

697
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,480
This is where I was asleep.

698
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,780
Why would you want to see this?

699
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,190
I was curious.

700
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,130
In order to know who you are, I need to know where you come from, too.

701
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,740
Why would you want to get to know me better?

702
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:44,850
I would like you to protect Bu Ja's body like this by becoming good.

703
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,390
Stop doing evil.

704
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,520
If you keep at it, Ma Wang or the Great Sage will get rid of you.

705
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,100
And I don't want to see that happen.

706
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,270
It's a sarcophagus. You laid in this tight space for 1,200 years?

707
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,490
Yes.

708
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,610
It must have been sad.

709
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,130
You said you were betrayed.

710
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,890
How sad and angry you must have been.

711
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:22,110
I get why you became bad like this.

712
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:28,050
Yes. I'm being a little bad because I'm angry.

713
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,660
It's not that I've become an evil spirit.

714
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,820
You can just be nice from now on.

715
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,250
You said you were a priestess.

716
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,970
I like that you don't make me look pitiful.

717
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,380
Is the evil spirit that strong and dangerous?

718
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,000
Is that why you didn't tell me about it?

719
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,990
Yeah, it's strong.

720
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,260
Ma Wang fought against it a while back,

721
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,080
and he got scared just looking into its eyes.

722
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,200
Then it must be really strong.

723
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,020
Don't worry. I'm much stronger than Ma Wang.

724
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,240
Ma Wang said differently though.

725
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,650
Ma Wang did? I'm much, much stronger than him!

726
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,700
What are you looking at? Ah, that mean cow.

727
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,410
They've been looking at you since earlier. You've become famous.

728
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:33,750
It's bothersome. Watching TV the whole day and chasing after you was much better.

729
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,460
You can't even go, "Ta-da!" and disappear either.

730
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,070
It must be uncomfortable getting around.

731
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,290
I'm doing pretty well though.

732
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,730
It turns out that dealing with humans is nothing special.

733
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,440
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

734
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,940
Watch where you're going.

735
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,320
Yes.

736
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:02,090
Humans don't talk like that to their elders.

737
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,820
He would be only 80 at most.

738
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,330
Do you know how old I am?

739
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,250
Never mind. I don't want to talk about age differences with you.

740
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:17,700
If you want to pretend to be a human, you should watch your basic manners.

741
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,460
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

742
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,650
Please bring a glass of champagne for this lady here.

743
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,170
Yes.

744
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,800
See that? I can do everything if I set my mind to it.

745
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,610
Hello. We were introduced to each other at the social club recently.

746
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,180
Yes.

747
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:45,000
This is my daughter, and she studied cooking in Paris

748
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,230
and will soon be in charge of our company's food business department.

749
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,200
Thank you.

750
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,140
Drink this.

751
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,090
Should I watch my manners?

752
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,330
Just act like your usual self.

753
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,980
Hand it over; it's not yours.

754
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,950
What sort of manners is that?

755
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:12,700
I have shitty manners. Want to see more?

756
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,240
Let's go.

757
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,980
The scent is nice.

758
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,420
All the humans gathered here smell foul.

759
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,830
Having them assembled here makes it nearly impossible to endure.

760
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,570
That's why I was surprised when you came in.

761
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,190
I didn't see you for just a few days,

762
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,050
but your scent has become stronger.

763
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:55,710
Ma Wang said so as well. I guess it's true.

764
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,910
Going around to look for things and coming all the way here. You've changed.

765
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,690
I'll be changing more from now on.

766
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,650
I met with the peddler.

767
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,290
She told me about the things that I have to do.

768
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,600
What?

769
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,600
She told me that I'll have to choose to empty out something that's very precious to me.

770
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,410
So I thought long and hard about what that could be.

771
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:29,070
Why would you think about it? Are you a dish? Empty out what?

772
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,290
It's probably my feelings.

773
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:37,570
Since what I'm full of right now is the love I have for you.

774
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:44,990
Because of that, I've been hesitating while worrying.

775
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:50,860
If I empty it all out, I think I'll be able to carry out my duty.

776
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,710
So I'm going to empty it all out.

777
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:05,210
That's fair. Mine will disappear and you will empty yours.

778
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:09,390
What the white heron told me about me being special

779
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,400
and my ability to save people...

780
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,420
I've decided to believe that.

781
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,420
Since I'm that great of a person,

782
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,360
I should be able to empty out my heart as well.

783
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,190
So you came all the way here to tell me that you're going to dump it all out in one go?

784
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:32,000
Fine, empty it all out. And make sure you wash that dish properly.

785
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,480
You...

786
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:45,590
I don't care if you throw everything onto the pavement or into the sewer,

787
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,370
but don't do it in front of me.

788
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,610
I'm the one who gave you all I have to fill you up that much,

789
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,860
so I would look too pitiful.

790
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,250
Do it well where I can't see you.

791
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,720
♫ When I saw you ♫

792
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,280
♫ I think only about you ♫

793
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,060
♫ When I love you ♫

794
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,080
♫ Did you miss me ♫

795
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,880
♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

796
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,850
♫ I will ♫

797
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,070
Shall I show you stars?

798
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,120
♫ I wish you next, just as we are ♫

799
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,310
♫ Can we go back ♫

800
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,290
♫ When I saw you ♫

801
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,330
I have to empty out my feelings

802
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,960
so that I can live while looking at the stars.

803
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,990
♫ Always behind of you ♫

804
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,920
Wow, this...

805
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:12,770
Why is it that the General Store's grandson and I couldn't remove it,

806
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:16,560
but Secretary Ma could so easily?

807
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,300
Is it made for men?

808
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,270
I'm back, Ma Wang.

809
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,500
Sam Jang met with the Great Sage.

810
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,600
Did she catch on?

811
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,600
About the Great Sage intending to die in her place?

812
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,380
Not yet.

813
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,570
But wouldn't she find out in the end?

814
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,810
Before Sam Jang finds out,

815
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:57,760
it would be nice to figure out how to take this off.

816
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,790
Secretary Ma, let's try it once more.

817
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,370
Okay.

818
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,450
You've come, Great Sage.

819
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,930
You met Sam Jang, didn't you? Why did you go see her?

820
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,100
Since she's a special and precious human.

821
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,070
Why did you meet her and blabber to her about emptying out or whatever?

822
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,780
What are you planning to fill it up with after emptying it out that you spewed out all that nonsense?

823
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,700
Sam Jang is a bowl.

824
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,880
A bowl of good that will contain the evil spirit born from this world.

825
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,780
So... will you only be satisfied if you contain the evil in the bowl and break it to pieces?

826
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,030
It's not something I can pressure to make happen.

827
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,490
That's something Sam Jang will have to choose at the end.

828
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:44,690
That child is a human who's special enough to choose that kind of sacrifice.

829
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:47,270
Just please let her stay alive.

830
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,600
That sacrifice, I'll make in her place.

831
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:56,730
Sam Jang has made the arrogant and haughty Great Sage choose to sacrifice himself.

832
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,990
You put that Geumganggo on me.

833
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:08,040
Who... are you?

834
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:15,420
Son Oh Gong, it seems you no longer need to be restrained by the Geumganggo.

835
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,970
The Geumganggo probably has no power anymore.

836
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:38,260
I don't think this stays stuck to me.

837
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,640
Jeez, I wonder why.

838
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,150
This is put on to gain obedience.

839
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:51,310
It is perhaps unnecessary because, from the start, I am absolutely obedient to you?

840
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,440
That's it!

841
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,660
Ah, so that was it!

842
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:09,790
Because from the start, you had no intent to disobey the Geumganggo,

843
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,250
so it just fell off.

844
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:23,630
Then, Son Oh Gong's Geumganggo can be taken off too?

845
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,470
You're saying I can take this off myself?

846
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:29,620
You don't regard the Geumganggo's love as a restraint anymore,

847
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,910
and you have no will to free yourself from it.

848
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:35,700
So why would you still need a shackle for restraint?

849
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,550
You yourself escaped from the control of the Geumganggo.

850
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:54,670
In that case, the deadly fate and heaven's plans...

851
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:58,270
could all come to pass differently.

852
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:02,100
♫ It was probably destiny ♫

853
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,480
♫ It was probably pre-destined ♫

854
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:10,380
♫ Even including when we first met ♫

855
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,390
♫ It can't be changed ♫

856
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:22,220
♫ When love is never ending ♫

857
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:29,320
♫ Like the night when even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds ♫

858
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,570
♫ My heart is turning black ♫

859
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,940
What should I do?

860
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,560
Seeing you like this,

861
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,610
you're even more beautiful.

862
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:49,130
♫ I am afraid you might forget me ♫

863
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,800
♫ If it were destiny, I will accept it ♫

864
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:02,610
♫ If so-called love becomes a sin ♫

865
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:05,980
♫ I will be able to see you again ♫

866
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:10,520
♫ If you truly love ♫

867
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,530
♫ If we were truly destined ♫

868
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:23,340
♫ If we were truly destined ♫

869
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,000
Great Sage, nut job!

870
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,190
I finally figured it out.

871
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,460
I figured out the Geumganggo's secret.

872
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:53,130
Now you can take this off...

873
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,120
You've already taken it off.

874
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,070
It just came right off.

875
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:06,160
How do you feel now?

876
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,970
Have you seen Sam Jang? How was it?

877
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:14,540
First, I defeated this.

878
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:19,410
My feelings didn't disappear like they weren't my own.

879
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:25,260
You're still in love with her.

880
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,520
I wonder since when I was able to take this off.

881
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,440
From when you threw away the sauces, I thought you were changed.

882
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,800
Was it then? Now, I definitely won't be able to guess when it was.

883
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,610
Why do you care to know when you were changed when the result is so obvious?

884
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,370
Only Sam Jang is going to happy.

885
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:53,210
What are you doing?

886
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,410
Why are you putting it back on again?

887
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,060
For her sake.

888
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,360
Sam Jang has always been curious about whether your love is real or fake.

889
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,710
If it's real, she'll really like that.

890
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,900
I saw the white heron's last choice.

891
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:22,050
Without that, it's too painful for me to endure this long life alone.

892
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:27,910
In case Jin Seon Mi is left alone, I won't leave any love behind with her.

893
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:32,060
After everything is over and when I am safe,

894
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:38,400
at that time, I'll take this off myself and show her.

895
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:43,340
Even you try being darn cool,

896
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,790
you're just a thug, a nut job!

897
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:54,940
Where did you hide the sword you were given?

898
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:58,580
Why? Now you're looking for the sword too?

899
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,890
Do you love me that much?

900
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:03,700
Forget it. Don't tell me.

901
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,800
Gosh, I wasted a lot of money buying a geumganggo to experiment with.

902
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:15,280
You hid that sword in Sureumdong, didn't you?

903
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:20,800
So you sealed off Sureumdong so no one could go in, right?

904
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,720
Ma Wang, I was even able to defeat this,

905
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,160
so I will also be able to defeat a dragon.

906
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,430
You said you were with Ah Sa Nyeo?

907
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,890
Bu Ja's mom died, and I saw her crying.

908
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:53,180
Maybe she's gradually turning into Bu Ja

909
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,820
since she's using Bu Ja's body.

910
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:58,150
Be careful of Ah Sa Nyeo.

911
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,740
Although you might not like it, Winter General,

912
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,690
I felt sorry when I talked to her.

913
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:08,550
After I comfort her, I will make her my younger brother again, just like Bu Ja was.

914
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:11,550
That makes no sense. She's a really bad woman.

915
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,520
Gosh, what do you know?

916
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,030
Right now, she's together with the guy who killed Bu Ja.

917
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,760
- What?
- When Bu Ja was looking for the human who killed her,

918
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,010
Ah Sa Nyeo possessed her.

919
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:26,650
After that, she's been by his side helping him.

920
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,140
She's a really bad evil spirit.

921
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,770
You're saying this is the house of someone named Kang Dae Seong?

922
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,230
Why are you here with him?

923
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:45,340
I chose him.

924
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:49,010
Even though she knows that he's the one who killed Bu Ja,

925
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:52,240
she chose him?

926
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,750
I'm going to kill them.

927
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:06,330
That person and Ah Sa Nyeo, I'm going to kill them all!

928
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,590
Why did you come?

929
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:29,050
Why did you throw this?

930
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,410
You told me you would empty your feelings yourself.

931
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:35,980
But I happened to see you doing it alone sadly on the rooftop of a building.

932
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,930
Why do you throw it away as you please?

933
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:42,490
Yes. You can do as you please. Whether it's throwing it or pouring it.

934
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:47,600
Because I was piling them neatly in order, I have a lot of stuff to get rid of.

935
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,020
Still, what did you say? Not to dump stuff in front of you?

936
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:57,960
So did you come to complain to me that you have a lot of stuff stored?

937
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,360
Do you know how much I have to get rid of? You bad jerk!

938
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,230
I didn't know you had accumulated so much.

939
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,560
Yeah. So that's why I'm going to spill everything on you.

940
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,510
Without throwing it away on the street or abandoning it in the corner of the room while crying,

941
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,680
I'm going to vent everything on you.

942
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:20,100
Yes. Do it. If you feel so wronged, do as you please.

943
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,190
Because I will endure and listen to you.

944
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,580
Do it.

945
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,520
