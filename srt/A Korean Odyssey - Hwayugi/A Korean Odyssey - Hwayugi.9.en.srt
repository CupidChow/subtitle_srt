00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,680
How did I end up in this situation with that rascal?

6
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,390
When the bell rang, he was there.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,120
Soulmate?

8
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,070
Is he really my destined husband?

♫ Your barbed words stabbed me and ♫

Can I trust this bell?

25
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,480
Is it true that he is my soulmate?

26
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
How could you pause all of a sudden in the middle?

27
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,070
I almost lost the evil spirit!

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,480
Ma Wang, stop playing the piano. It's all over.

29
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,720
Ma Wang, I told you to stop.

30
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,240
Ma Wang!

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Ma Wang! Have you lost it? Gosh, seriously.

32
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,500
You don't even know how to play the piano! I said we should just play a CD.

33
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,920
It's been such a while since I played the piano, so I lost myself in playing.

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,430
You said it was your first time though.

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,640
Was it that obvious?

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,770
The time is up for the rental dress. Please take it off quickly.

37
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,240
Yes.

38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,530
Why is it so drapey and poufy? It must be very uncomfortable.

39
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,010
Hey, Secretary Ma. How come you gave her a dress like that? No one wears that kind of style these days.

40
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,530
Sam Jang herself chose this dress.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,790
I thought this was the prettiest.

42
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,410
If you put air in your sleeves, you would fly away.

43
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,720
This style was trendy 30 years ago.

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,260
When you actually get married, I'll have to choose your dress for you.

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,260
It's so tacky. It's hard to look at.

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,760
The trend these days is for the dress to be see-through and flowy.

47
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,950
Nobody wears this kind of stuff nowadays.

48
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,480
Why are you guys like this?

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,510
She looks pretty, even in this garbage.

50
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,450
You're pretty, pretty. No matter what you wear, you're pretty.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,030
This isn't even a real wedding. Who cares what kind of wedding dress I wear?

52
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,520
That's enough. Since the wedding ceremony is over, we should go eat.

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,820
When you go to a wedding, you eat beef rib soup. Ma Wang, let's eat beef rib soup.

54
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,360
- I'm a bull. How dare you suggest to eat beef rib soup?
- Ah, what about beef stew?

55
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
- Forget it.
- Beef meat soup.

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
- That's also beef!
- Alright, alright!

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,090
- Then beef head soup! Decided!
- Eat it by yourself!

58
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,200
Let's go! Come quickly.

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,230
I reserved a local restaurant!

60
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,290
- Ah, what a rude thug! Seriously.
- Let's go eat.

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,460
- But beef head soup is good.
- Ah! Seriously!

62
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,660
What if he really is my soulmate?

63
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,580
What are you doing?

64
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,430
Do you like that dress that much?

65
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,350
You want to get married?

66
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,460
No! What do you mean marriage? Whom would I even marry?

67
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,660
You already got married twice! To me.

68
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,050
Once today and last time.

69
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,920
Last time?

70
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,560
How was that a wedding?

71
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,330
You can get married to me again. I'm in favor.

72
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,820
Come quickly.

73
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,630
I'm not going. Who said I was going to marry you?

74
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,230
I'm telling you to come quickly so we can go to the restaurant. We need to eat before leaving.

75
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,750
You can marry me too.

76
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,940
No matter how many times you become my bride, I'll always accept you.

77
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,260
Hurry up.

78
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,590
I must have gone crazy.

79
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,760
I feel like I can hear the bell ringing.

80
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,150
Ma Wang, then is Sam Jang's suffering over?

81
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,200
Ah, she says that she's come to her senses.

82
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,580
Since I no longer have to worry about what will happen after the Geumganggo is taken off,

83
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,050
I don't have any expectations, and I feel at peace.

84
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,240
Since she has no expectations from that rascal, and she feels at peace,

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,560
she picked that kind of dress to wear.

86
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,210
If she had dressed prettily, I would have been suspicious.

87
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,000
Even though she was dressed that way, the Great Sage said she was pretty.

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,990
That's because that rascal's Geumganggo creates an unconditional love.

89
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:04,510
"The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a single being even to God,"

90
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,220
"that is love." Victor Hugo said.

91
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,140
For the Great Sage with the Geumganggo, Sam Jang is his whole universe and God.

92
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,770
Exactly. Did Victor Hugo wear the Geumganggo as well?

93
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,950
How did he know that so exactly?

94
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,210
He must have been in love.

95
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,780
Isn't that why you understand the love as well, Ma Wang?

96
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,230
Because you had a person who was your whole universe and God?

97
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:42,520
That woman who was my universe and God is probably living somewhere in this world.

98
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,070
This time around, what kind of painful fate must she be enduring?

99
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,050
[Police]

100
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,860
Pig, is this our first date?

101
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,910
Since our relationship is now public, you want to flirt in front of everyone for show, huh?

102
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,040
Octopus, we are breaking up here.

103
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,290
Out of all of the men here, pick one that is good enough.

104
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,590
Let's move you over to him.

105
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,350
If you need more energy to do so, I will help you with it.

106
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,490
Just come out of this body.

107
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,880
Why? You don't like this body?

108
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,240
I like it. I also was interested in Alice's body.

109
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,560
Of course, I could have dated her casually.

110
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,030
However, I have never had a scandal.

111
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,940
Are you scared your popularity with other women will drop?

112
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,080
No. I'm angry because you ruined an opportunity that I've been saving very preciously.

113
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,150
An opportunity?

114
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,210
There's a girl whom I cherish as a little sister.

115
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,790
There's a reason she needs to become very famous.

116
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,140
But you ruined her opportunity.

117
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,580
A girl you cherish?

118
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,590
The zombie? Were you going to make a scandal with the zombie?

119
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,600
Anyhow, I need to take care of your matter first.

120
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,540
Pick out a man.

121
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,060
I will find a much better man than that pig and possess that man's body.

122
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,340
They'll be out soon.

123
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,220
I don't want to do this kind of work.

124
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,990
I think it would be good for our Oh Gong to stay out of it this time.

125
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,260
You have to be by my side.

126
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,160
Oh, they're coming out.

127
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm here to pick them up in place of Han Byeol's father.

128
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,580
Yes, I was notified.

129
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,370
Hello, kids.

130
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,250
I heard Uncle Jonathan would come.

131
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,940
I'm going.

132
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,630
Oh, Ahjusshi Jonathan was supposed to come,

133
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,150
but something came up, so Auntie Real Estate came instead.

134
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,830
Okay.

135
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
What?

136
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,410
This is Uncle Oh Gong.

137
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,720
Who said I'm an uncle? I don't want to be called an uncle.

138
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,660
Don't call me uncle.

139
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,890
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,980
Noona, then what should I call him?

141
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,200
Secretary Son.

142
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,520
Take care of the kids for an hour here. I have to go to the bank.

143
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,500
Then can I temporarily seal the kids' lips for an hour?

144
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,370
- I dare you to.
- You will regret this.

145
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,390
It's possible that your company's only employee might resent you and quit.

146
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,980
Then I will be really sad.

147
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,610
Just one hour.

148
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,540
I'll be back soon.

149
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,350
I'll just watch over you kids.

150
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,060
Don't ask me for anything.

151
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,660
I know that it's a bothersome task to watch someone else's kids.

152
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,600
We won't ask you for anything, Secretary Son.

153
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,730
Hey, what are you drawing?

154
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,510
Is that a cucumber?

155
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,950
It's a dinosaur.

156
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,790
How is that a dinosaur? It looks like a cucumber.

157
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,690
It's a herbivore dinosaur. A brontosaurus.

158
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,810
It must be a cucumber that the herbivore brontosaurus is eating.

159
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,110
Let's redraw it.

160
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,430
What are you going to draw again?

161
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,900
Please don't concern yourself about it, Secretary Son.

162
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,670
Is it a dinosaur again? Geez.

163
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,950
What kind of dinosaur is that?

164
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,560
A brontosaurus.

165
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,980
Again? Hey, the brontosaurus is the only dinosaur you know, right?

166
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,300
You don't know any others.

167
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,280
If you know any others, then tell me. Tell me, tell me!

168
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Hey, little kid next to her.

169
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,970
The only dinosaur your sister knows is this long cucumber like brontosaurus.

170
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,030
Right? Did they only teach you this one thing at your preschool?

171
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,520
You didn't study properly, huh?

172
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,660
Why are you crying?

173
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,490
Stop it. Don't cry.

174
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,520
I got it. I got it. I will show you a dinosaur. A dinosaur.

175
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,830
If I show you a dinosaur, you can't cry.

176
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,970
Okay, look here.

177
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,080
Wow!

178
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Did you have enough?

179
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,350
They must be kids from the same preschool.

180
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,050
Let's go.

181
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,220
Where did they go?

182
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,140
Oh? What brings you to my house?

183
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,390
Hyungnim asked me to come and make some snacks for the kids.

184
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,370
Is that so?

185
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,140
Since I'm here, would it be alright to clean the refrigerator also?

186
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,820
I don't think I'll be able to sleep at night if I just left it.

187
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,780
Okay.

188
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,610
Thank you.

189
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,880
The chairman of a company that manufactures refrigerators

190
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,520
is cleaning my refrigerator?

191
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,080
Oh, Jeo Pal Gye.

192
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,700
I'm here as PK today.

193
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,140
Hyungnim Oh Gong asked me to sign autographs and sing a song for the kids.

194
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,870
I have to get to my Singapore concert, but I'm late.

195
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,670
I'm going then.

196
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,150
PK came to my house to sing a song?

197
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,580
Bu Ja, you came as well.

198
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,740
Yes. Son Oh Gong asked me to come and draw with the kids.

199
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,480
Thank you.

200
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,420
But where is that punk?

201
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,370
Kids aren't a good match for me.

202
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,350
Why did they suddenly cry? They startled this monkey.

203
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,170
We don't get along.

204
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,750
I am going to do somersaults at home.

205
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,750
Han Byeol, we should go home.

206
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,490
I don't want to go. I'm not going home.

207
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,490
I don't want to go either.

208
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,500
We saw a brontosaurus,

209
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,260
and we saw the Chairman and PK also!

210
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,810
You were only watching TV all day long, huh?

211
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,000
I didn't see them on TV. They were real.

212
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,600
We also saw an unni whose eyes pop out.

213
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:03,090
Kids, you should hurry home. Your mom must be waiting.

214
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,740
We're not going.

215
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,560
We're not going.

216
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,340
Uh oh, our Han Byeol needs to stop being stubborn and go home.

217
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,380
This Auntie Real Estate is really scary.

218
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,270
You're going to get in trouble. That's enough. Come here.

219
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,020
I'm going to marry Secretary Son and live here.

220
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,350
Han Byeol, marriage is for soulmates.

221
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,470
I want to do that.

222
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,180
No, you definitely can't do that.

223
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,170
Someone else is your soulmate.

224
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,560
You can't marry him. Never.

225
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,620
But why are you so scarily opposing a child's marriage?

226
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,610
I'm also against this marriage as her father.

227
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,610
Let's go, Han Byeol. Come here.

228
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,470
Let's go.

229
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,000
You can marry me too.

230
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,250
No matter how many times you become my bride, I'll always accept you.

231
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,130
Soulmate. Could it be for real?

232
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,090
One of the death bells has disappeared.

233
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,560
I heard that the grandson of the peddler lost it.

234
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,110
By death bell, are you talking about the unlucky black bell?

235
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:34,980
Right. It lets you know who is the worst fate for you in your life.

236
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,500
It would be dangerous if it fell into the hands of a human.

237
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,990
If we found it, we may get some points for it.

238
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,350
So you're going to ask Sam Jang to find those kinds of missing items as well?

239
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,690
Me? For something so trivial, I'll ask Secretary Ma to find it.

240
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,320
Gosh.

241
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,180
Don't make Sam Jang touch that unlucky thing.

242
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,270
I got it. Gosh.

243
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,620
[The Sun and the Moon]

244
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,610
Oppa, I'm hungry.

245
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,430
911 emergency rescue team. An emergency!

246
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,470
Be quiet!

247
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,920
An urgent patient.

248
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,680
I told you not to be noisy!

249
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,120
Run away to the room!

250
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,860
I told you not to be noisy!

251
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,800
Father, I was wrong.

252
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,440
Do my words don't seem like words to you?

253
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,490
- I told you to be quiet.
- Oppa. Oppa.

254
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,860
Father, spare me.

255
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,110
Oppa.

256
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,210
Oppa. Oppa.

257
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,770
Oppa.

258
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,340
A fierce tiger chased after a girl and her brother.

259
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,830
The siblings prayed for help.

260
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,550
At that moment, a golden rope came down from the heavens.

261
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,980
It's a rope.

262
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:13,710
[The two kids held the rope and went up to heaven.]

263
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,630
Soo Jeong.

264
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,590
Lee Soo Jeong!

265
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,780
Soo Jeong!

266
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,850
Lee Soo Jeong!

267
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,680
Lee Soo Jeong!

268
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,030
[The Sun and the Moon]

269
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:10,930
The heavenly deities say that the souls of kids have been disappearing a lot recently.

270
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:17,440
I guess an evil spirit that steals children's souls has appeared.

271
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,730
I thought so too, so I want to ask you to take care of it but...

272
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,840
will you be all right with that?

273
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,520
Why wouldn't I be?

274
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,800
By any chance, are you worried that the evil spirit might be Princess Iron Fan?

275
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,240
Princess Iron Fan was also an evil spirit that ate up the souls of children, wasn't she?

276
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,680
She was already caught and is being punished for it, is she not?

277
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,560
I know that. Of course, it's not Princess Iron Fan.

278
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,450
But I'm simply concerned that this might unnecessarily remind you of that incident.

279
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:07,780
If you're that concerned about it, then when I catch the evil spirit,

280
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,700
be sure to give me a lot of points for it.

281
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,470
Bringing up Princess Iron Fan really fires him up. Give me some more tea.

282
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,760
There is none left. I don't wish to give you any. Please leave.

283
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,790
What a faithful dog.

284
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,310
Even that famous dog Patrasche (from Dog of Flanders) wasn't as loyal as her.

285
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,050
Jeong Se Ra is still alive, has lost her memory after the accident,

286
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,930
and is currently living as a trainee for Lucifer Entertainment?

287
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm sorry we didn't tell you earlier that she disappeared.

288
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,550
That's okay.

289
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,930
I'm sure you both must have been surprised when her body went missing.

290
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,930
In any case, what happened on that day was all a misunderstanding then, wasn't it?

291
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,190
You've both worked hard.

292
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,480
There won't be any reason for us to see each other in the future.

293
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,880
Still, it's a relief.

294
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,550
He didn't ask us to give him back our payment.

295
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,350
As expected, he is different because he's highly educated.

296
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,960
For me, something doesn't feel right. Let's lie low for the time being.

297
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,530
Make it so that I won't be able to see those two anymore.

298
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,770
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

299
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,770
She's totally safe and sound.

300
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,450
But she was dead for sure.

301
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,370
Did I mistake her as dead because I had been drinking?

302
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,600
What are you going to do about that girl?

303
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,090
I'm going to need to get another proper look at her.

304
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,550
Hey, do you think that is your bed?

305
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,470
Why are you always coming in here and lying there?

306
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,860
This is much more comfortable than the veranda.

307
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,070
This bathtub wasn't made for you to relax here. Get out of there already.

308
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,390
I don't want to.

309
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,280
You don't want to? You little—

310
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,540
Sure, stay right there. I'll just pour some hot water and boil you alive!

311
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,150
I'll make it piping hot and just pour it on you!

312
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,250
Because you are mean like this, Sam Jang doesn't like you.

313
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,800
Who said she doesn't like me?

314
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,840
- I just know it.
- What would a zombie know?

315
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:16,650
I woke up with her blood. Elder Soo Boo Ri said I am connected to her.

316
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,920
Really?

317
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,380
So you just know how she feels?

318
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,350
Probably. Since we are connected.

319
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,450
Come here. Look at me straight.

320
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,610
When you look at me, what comes to your mind?

321
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,960
Son Oh Gong, you are handsome.

322
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,360
I know, but I don't want to know your opinion. What does Sam Jang think? Sam Jang.

323
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,400
You... have no clue, right?

324
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,330
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,500
That's fine. It can happen.

326
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,550
Sit there. Just stay there.

327
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,920
Which side was the hot water? I'm going to cook you up real good.

328
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,530
She likes you.

329
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,440
She likes you, Son Oh Gong.

330
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,920
I can tell just by looking at her.

331
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,230
Are you tricking me just because you don't want to be cooked?

332
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,200
If I turned into a steamed zombie, Unni will be sad.

333
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,950
If Unni's sad, then doesn't that make you sad as well?

334
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,350
You two are connected as well.

335
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,510
Even a zombie can learn how to brown-nose as it ages.

336
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,580
You're saved from being a steamed zombie.

337
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,810
Please turn off the lights when you leave.

338
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,120
Take a shower on the second floor. The zombie is sleeping in the bathtub.

339
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,450
I poured so much money into that bathtub but it's turning into a coffin for a zombie.

340
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,580
So why on earth did you bring such a zombie when you can't handle her properly?

341
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,950
I clearly told you that you could burn her.

342
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,030
But you're the one that keeps raising her in that refrigerator!

343
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,690
How can I burn a kid after we took her in and have started taking care of her?

344
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,500
You have neither a sense of responsibility nor compassion. Such a thug.

345
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,040
Why are you acting like a nice guy by cursing me? If she's that much of a bother then you can just throw her away.

346
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,410
Unlike you, I don't throw things away just because they're bothersome.

347
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,540
Oh, is that so?

348
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,350
Then tell me again how a guy with such a strong sense of responsibility left Princess Iron Fan to end up like that?

349
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:26,860
Ma Wang, I'll take the zombie out to the veranda.

350
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,960
Take a bath.

351
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,550
Forget it.

352
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,450
I shouldn't have brought up Princess Iron Fan.

353
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,360
Ma Wang, the most valuable liquor in my entire collection saved in Sureumdong

354
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,070
isn't this one, but it's still pretty valuable.

355
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,520
Because we were needlessly fighting over that zombie, Princess Iron Fan came up.

356
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,070
Since it's come to this, should we just throw the zombie out?

357
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,950
Don't bother. Don't blame Bu Ja for this.

358
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,390
If you're that sorry, then work hard to get me points

359
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,660
so that I can quickly become a deity.

360
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,850
Right. You need to become a deity quickly so you can save Princess Iron Fan.

361
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,190
She wasn't just Princess Iron Fan; she used to be a deity.

362
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,200
I was the one who turned her into the monster Princess Iron Fan.

363
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,350
Because she met me, her fate changed.

364
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:41,550
Yeah. Why would a deity date you anyway? Such bad luck.

365
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,910
There probably is another woman with just as much bad luck as her though.

366
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,400
There's Sam Jang, whose fate changed after meeting you, isn't there?

367
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,310
The reason human Jin Seon Mi became Sam Jang is your fault, no?

368
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,890
So because of that I've got Geumganggo on me and am protecting her by her side, am I not?

369
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,720
Sam Jang said her wish is to become an ordinary person.

370
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,260
She had to put the Geumgganggo on you and catch evil spirits with you.

371
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,580
Instead of being Sam Jang, who can summon Son Oh Gong,

372
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,660
she wants to be an ordinary human who can both get married and have kids.

373
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,350
But you made it impossible for her to ever live like that by turning her into Sam Jang.

374
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,770
So you don't need to laugh at me.

375
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,520
You are also a very bad guy. Reflect on it.

376
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:36,110
Geez, you can't even soothe yourself with alcohol since you are not allowed to drink.

377
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,420
Right?

378
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,100
An ordinary Jin Seon Mi?

379
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,690
Thank you for looking after my kids.

380
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,570
This is a meal certificate for a snack-bar.

381
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,590
I didn't buy it. I won it as a prize. I heard the food is yummy there. Please go and have some.

382
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,290
It's okay. Please go with your family.

383
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,370
It's more work if we eat out since we have to take the kids.

384
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,870
On top of that, my kids only eat the deokbokki (spicy rice cake) I make.

385
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,860
I envy you.

386
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,430
Because of my deokbokki?

387
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:25,210
I envy people like you the most. People who have ordinary and happy lives with their family.

388
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,110
That's nothing.

389
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:32,170
You can also date someone and marry a guy after that.

390
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,170
Living like that is very difficult for me.

391
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,980
Why is it so difficult?

392
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,690
Then firstly, why don't you ask a guy out to eat deokbokki with you?

393
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,470
I'm not sure if that would be okay.

394
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,420
I will call him and ask him. Where is my phone?

395
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,700
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

396
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,380
Ah...

397
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,810
You don't need a phone to call him.

398
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,140
[Jonathan]

399
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,590
Oh my! When did you come?

400
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,280
Around when you mentioned that your kids only eat the deokbokki you make?

401
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,840
Who were you planning to call just now?

402
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,320
It's nothing.

403
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,550
There's no way that you weren't calling me, right?

404
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,610
You came?

405
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:28,530
Yeah. Just as Lee Han Joo was about to call me to have deokbokki with you, I came.

406
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,160
Then, will you go with me to eat deokbokki?

407
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,570
Sure.

408
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,650
Okay. I'll get my coat and be right back.

409
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,950
Right. Right. I was about to call Jonathan.

410
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,640
I was. I was. What are you going to do?

411
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,160
Just because of that, you don't have to look like you're ready to throw a punch at me.

412
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,960
What is there to be envious about?

413
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,890
- What?
- She just said she was envious that you could live an ordinary life.

414
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,850
Are you envious of my ordinary life as well?

415
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,490
No way. Not at all. Never.

416
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,480
Then you should let her go.

417
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,120
You can't make my CEO happy, ever.

418
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,250
My tummy.

419
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,800
Deokbokki looks spicy. I should have ordered a mild one.

420
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,030
They said this one is the yummiest.

421
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,380
Let's try it first.

422
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,130
It feels really weird that we're sitting and talking about deokbokki instead of an evil spirit.

423
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,000
Isn't this what you wished to do? This is an ordinary thing to do.

424
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,410
You're right. I like it.

425
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,320
- You like these kinds of things?
- Yes.

426
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,370
Then let's keep going like this.

427
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,790
This one looks too spicy for me, so eat it all and bring me a mild one.

428
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,160
You brought this, saying this looked the yummiest.

429
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,440
I can exchange this for the mild one at that table, but I won't do it to be ordinary.

430
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,810
You eat this up and bring me a new one.

431
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,860
Okay.

432
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,700
- Is it tasty?
- It is spicy.

433
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,930
Where are we going?

434
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,810
We don't have any destination. We are just taking a walk like others.

435
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,990
- So we just keep going like this?
- Yeah.

436
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,060
No, wait, this is not walking in an ordinary way.

437
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,100
Everyone walks like this.

438
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,220
You should also not look forward, but at your phone while walking.

439
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,110
♫ At your words, I lose my strength ♫

440
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,090
♫ Whatever you do ♫

441
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,670
♫ I can't stop my laughter ♫

442
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,970
Everyone walks like this.

443
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,900
What are you looking at me for? Look at your phone like an ordinary person.

444
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,070
♫ To me, you become my world ♫

445
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:33,200
♫ Now you let me breathe ♫

446
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,290
♫ I will always be by your side ♫

447
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,140
So we ate something delicious, we took a stroll, and I took you home.

448
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,170
Thanks.

449
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,980
In this situation, you need to make a decision.

450
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,970
Out of the ordinary relationships, which one should we be?

451
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,180
A friend would come in, play, and leave.

452
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,440
A family member would come in, eat, and leave.

453
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
A boyfriend would come in, sleep, and leave.

454
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,820
Don't you make a pass at me.

455
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,850
Yes, I'm making a pass at you.

456
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,150
But I became curious as I was doing so.

457
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,290
About what?

458
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,960
If we forget about the master and servant relationship caused by the Geumganggo, what are we?

459
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,960
If you're not Sam Jang, you have no reason to call me, the Great Sage.

460
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,300
If your special ability disappears, I will be gone from your side.

461
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,690
Will that really be okay with you?

462
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,830
Even if so, would you like it?

463
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,870
I'm leaving.

464
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,790
If your special ability disappears, I will be gone from your side.

465
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Will that really be okay with you?

466
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,900
Will she really be okay with that?

467
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,890
I was wondering...

468
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:49,890
It must be impossible for a human to have a demon as her soulmate, right?

469
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,590
- It makes no sense, right?
- Yes, it makes no sense.

I've never seen a human and a demon become a couple and live happily ever after.

472
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,130
I heard that a human found a demon as her soulmate, though.

473
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,480
That there is a couple who is fated by Birth Grandmother (goddess governing childbirth).

474

From where?

00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,690
I heard it from the grandson of the peddler.

What did he call it... love bell?

He said it rang.

Is that so? Did Birth Grandmother made a mistake?

480

Even so, even if it were a mistake,

481
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,860
if those two are fated to be soulmates, they will be soulmates until the end, right?

482
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,320
It cannot be undone, right?

483

Such a fated tie cannot be undone.

484

Whether the connection is fate or an evil destiny, it can never be untied.

It's a biscuit.

The kids followed the way the biscuits led.

Then, a house made of all sorts of sweets appeared right in front of them.

00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:22,250
Son Oh Gong is searching for an evil spirit that's taking away the souls of children.

629
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,360
Sam Jang or whatever, I don't like all of it.

630
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,370
I am the most pitiful person.

631
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,920
[The Little Match Girl]

632
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:36,410
As the hungry child lit the first match, in front of him appeared many delicious foods.

633
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:51,850
The lonely child lit the second match, and in front of him appeared his family whom he longed for the most.

634
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,030
Soo Jeong.

635
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,890
Take me with you.

636
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,640
Me too. I want to go with you.

637
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,490
Soo Jeong.

638
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:46,140
You can't do this. You can't go!

639
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:49,740
Looks like I'm going to have to read a different fairy tale.

640
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,090
It's dangerous here!

641
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,550
Get out of here quickly, and tell this man to come pick you up!

642
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,500
Quickly!

643
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,730
Ahjussi will come and pick you up.

644
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,350
Okay?

645
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,810
What are you?

646
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,770
I'm a bookseller who reads happy stories to children.

647
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:53,070
Then why did you steal those children's souls?

648
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,930
I didn't steal them.

649
01:00:54,930 --> 01:01:00,240
I allowed those terribly unhappy children to live in happy fairy tales.

650
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,440
Where are all the children you took away?

651
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,860
The children's souls are trapped inside of the books.

652
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,550
We'll have to open all the books to find the trapped children.

653
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,990
Where could the owner of this bookstore be?

654
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,850
In order to find the evil spirit, you should call Sam Jang.

655
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:37,450
She's probably absolutely despising the fact that she's Sam Jang right now though...

656
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:48,220
I can recognize the souls of unhappy children with just one glance.

657
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:53,460
All of those children were desperately praying that I take them away.

658
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,660
All of the kids called me.

659
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:59,660
Don't lie. Who called you?

660
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,490
You also know all too well, Seon Mi.

661
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,400
You used to call me, too.

662
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:14,140
I could recognize your extremely unhappy younger self at a single glance.

663
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,380
Just how lonely and unhappy that child was...

664
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,880
you know it well.

665
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,410
Shall I take that child away for you?

666
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:40,460
As long as that child is gone, then you won't have to struggle anymore.

667
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:49,080
I'll take away that child with such a special ability who made you unhappy.

668
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,240
[Jin Seon Mi]

669
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,990
[This belongs to a ghost.]

670
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:25,430
Can you really... take her away?

671
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:32,350
Of course. I came with a fun fairy tale book.

672
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,040
Shall I read the book that's just for you?

673
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:14,010
Goodbye.

674
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,390
Look here! Come to your senses! Look here!

675
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,570
Huh?

676
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:40,490
What's going on?

677
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,600
What is it?

678
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:56,070
I can't feel Sam Jang's drop of blood which has been wandering through my body.

679
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,420
Sam Jang...

680
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,760
has disappeared.

681
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,740
Son Oh Gong.

682
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,570
Something is off.

683
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,320
What is wrong?

684
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,370
She called for me?

685
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,490
Sam Jang did?

686
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,900
Something's extremely off.

687
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,550
You came.

688
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,620
What are you? Where is Sam Jang?

689
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,710
It's Sam Jang.

690
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:06,510
This woman is no longer Sam Jang.

691
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,390
I asked where is the person who called me.

692
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,700
I was the one who called you.

693
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,240
What?

694
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,460
What are you?

695
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:24,660
I'm the new owner of the Geumganggo.

♫ Go away, go away ♫

701

♫ I want to get away from you ♫

702
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:01,850

[Hwayugi]

01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:11,390
Is the owner of the Geumganggo changing?

706
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:14,990
Is that bookseller the new owner of the Geumganggo?

707
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,230
Then, the one Son Oh Gong loves now...

708
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,180
Son Oh Gong.

709
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,920
is not Jin Seon Mi

710
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,720
Son Oh Gong.

711
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,900
but rather that bookseller.

712
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,110
There's only one person who owns this Geumganggo.

713
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:30,090
From now on, your heart is going to love me.

You're mine now.

Damn it. I can't hold back anymore.
