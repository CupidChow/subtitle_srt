[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,700
A long time ago, when humans believed in the heavens and the heavens cared for the humans,

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,850
a monkey was born from a boiling hot rocky volcano.

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,300
The monkey was very strong and had a bad temper.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,290
He caused chaos here and there.

8
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,710
The heavens had no choice

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,440
but to make the monkey a deity to placate him.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,260
The monkey who became a deity

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,440
gave himself the title the Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven as he pleased.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,140
The Great Sage, the Equal of Heaven?
[Final Episode]

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,340
That's right.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,680
Then the monkey lived happily in heaven?

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,910
No. He committed a crime so he was punished.

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,860
Why?

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,270
In the rocky volcano where he was born,

18
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,490
the heavens placed a gigantic fire pillar through it,

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,030
so white smoke was coming out of it everyday.

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,380
Humans feared it because they were scared of seeing that.

21
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,030
They prayed to a stone monkey deity

22
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,660
to block the hole opened in a rocky volcano by the heavens.

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,160
The monkey became conceited and stole a long staff

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,680
used as a pillar in the dragon sea palace called the Magic Rod

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
to block that fire pillar.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,830
Did the rocky volcano stop producing smoke?

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,770
That's right. However, the heavens were extremely angry

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,410
at the monkey who blocked the fire pillar as he pleased.

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,780
The heavens captured this arrogant monkey

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,570
and locked him up in a prison called Five Elements Mountain.

31
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:17,180
Then the humans didn't help the monkey deity?

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,430
Afterwards, people didn't go to his temple.

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,860
No one remembered him either.

34
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,790
He was forgotten and was locked up for a long time.

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,940
Humans had no manners.

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,970
Humans by nature act differently when they have the urge to poop compared to after they poop.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,800
Why was he abandoned when he protected humans?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,880
Because he didn't do it to protect humans.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,230
He didn't love humans even the slightest bit.

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,930
It was an arrogant joke to make fun of the heavens and show off.

41
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,110
So the heavens got angry.

42
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,700
Is he still locked up inside of the Five Elements Mountain?

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,470
He already made his escape out of there.

44
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,460
After that, he got a truly painful punishment.

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,470
And right now, he is alone, living a lonely life.

46
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,390
Where is he all alone?

47
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,150
He is staying in a home with a very beautiful garden called Sureumdong.

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:32,830
By the way, wouldn't you like to see this stone monkey once?

49
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,020
Okay, kids. Have a good trip.

50
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,990
I will reward you with a lot of toys.

51
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,090
[Sureumdong]

52
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,670
I hope they can bring Son Oh Gong

53
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,010
out of Sureumdong.

54
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,270
On his wrist, he wears a pretty bracelet called the Geumganggo.

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,420
If you ask him to take it off and bring it to me,

56
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,790
I'll give you all the toys you want.

57
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,310
How dare you come into my garden without my permission?

58
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,490
Get out.

59
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,950
Get out!

60
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,290
I thought you were a mouse, but you're a human child.

61
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,900
How did you get in here?

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,010
Mr. "You pass" told us to come back with your bracelet.

63
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,610
It's Ma Wang's doing, again?

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,410
Go and tell him to stop sending bothersome things in here since I have no intention of leaving here.

65
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,250
Go.

66
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,230
Hey.

67
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,800
You dropped your dinosaur.

68
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,860
Hey, you dropped your umbrella.

69
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,510
Please protect me.

70
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,100
Then, we made a contract.

71
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,740
Fairy, please don't go!

72
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,420
Are you alright?

73
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,550
You... do you know me? Have we met before?

74
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,520
Does it hurt a lot?

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,590
Go, kid.

76
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,530
As his whole body got broken, his memory was also shattered into pieces.

77
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,680
Sometimes, when a fragment of his previous memories pops up,

78
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,750
it leaves behind severe heart pain for a reason that he does not know.

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,020
In that state, he shut himself in Sureumdong and has no intention to come out.

80
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,660
All of his memories of Sam Jang have become fragmented

81
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,970
and Sam Jang is longer in this world. So why is he still like that?

82
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,400
- The Geumganggo is still as is.
- It's because he has no intention of removing it.

83
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,420
No, rather, the Geumganggo has a tight grasp on his heart and won't let go.

84
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,610
Anyway, thanks to the Geumganggo,

85
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,570
he is still alive.

86
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,560
The moment his whole body was shattered,

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,810
only his heart which was bound by the Geumganggo was left unharmed.

88
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,500
What saved the rascal who should have died was the Geumganggo.

89
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,940
His softened heart, which we thought would become his biggest weakness,

90
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,600
brought his broken body back to life.

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,450
That's what's strange.

92
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,380
According to the Heavens' plans,

93
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,780
the Geumganggo should have disappeared the moment Sam Jang died.

94
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,500
It seems like there isn't anything that the heavens know for certain

95
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,090
nor are there any plans that go according to their will.

96
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,570
Even the death bell's fate was cut off by their own will.

97
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,120
When Sam Jang chose to fulfill her summons,

98
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,040
there was only one thing she asked for.

99
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,120
I will accept it all.

100
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,220
But I cannot make him kill me.

101
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,200
If I have to empty everything, then until everything is emptied, including my life,

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,500
please make sure to hold Son Oh Gong back so that he absolutely can't come to me.

103
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,260
Son Oh Gong hid the sword

104
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,490
and Sam Jang was stabbed by the sword of the wicked.

105
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,040
In that way, the death bell's fate was put to an end.

106
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,770
Anyway, the Great Sage needs to return to the heavens now.

107
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,130
But in his current state, would it be alright to take him there?

108
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,360
Try taking him there once.

109
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,090
If you take Oh Gong back to the heavens, when he is not in his right mind... holy moly!

110
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,430
You will get to see many interesting things!

111
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,240
It would be unreasonable, right?

112
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,490
That's why when we discussed the means of removing the Geumganggo in the heavens,

113
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,330
there's one idea that I've come up with.

114
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,840
- What would that be?
- Calling the owner of the Geumganggo to remove it.

115
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,390
When you say the owner of the Geumganggo...

116
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:24,420
Sam Jang. No, Jin Seon Mi. We will temporarily summon her from the underworld

117
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,330
for the duration of just one day so that she can remove the Geumganggo.

118
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,600
I don't know if that idea was chosen though.

119
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,490
I want this one.

120
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,370
It smells good. Delicious.

121
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,050
Son Oh Gong.

122
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,340
Son Oh Gong.

123
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,490
Another bothersome intruder must have come in.

124
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,100
What are you? You're not human.

125
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,970
It's really still there as before.

126
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,290
How did a minor evil spirit like you enter Sureumdong?

127
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,110
It seems your temper has gotten worse.

128
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,010
It seems a minor evil spirit is joking around not knowing exactly who I am.

129
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,060
The Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

130
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,480
How dare you act up despite knowing who I am? Do you have a death wish?

131
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,470
I'm already dead, so how can I die again?

132
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,560
What are you? Do you know me?

133
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,950
I know you very well.

134
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,180
I was the one who put the Geumganggo on you.

135
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,950
I came to take it off.

136
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,860
Jin Seon Mi won't be able to take off the Geumganggo

137
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,210
because the owner of the Geumganggo is Son Oh Gong himself

138
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,240
who has put it on himself again through his own strength.

139
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,590
And the heavens don't know that.

140
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,290
But why didn't you reveal this information to him?

141
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,140
Then he wouldn't call Jin Seon Mi, now would he?

142
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,300
Because Jin Seon Mi also doesn't know the secret behind the Geumganggo, she came to take it off.

143
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,230
Even if he meets Jin Seon Mi, he won't be able to recognize her since his memory is fragmented.

144
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,220
He needs to realize the fact that he can take off the Geumganggo himself.

145
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,390
For that to happen, he has to piece together his fragmented memory.

146
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,650
And Jin Seon Mi is the only one who is capable of doing so.

147
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,930
There is only one day for that opportunity.

148
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,450
You put this on me?

149
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,980
That's right, I did.

150
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,710
Since I am now dead, I will take it off and leave.

151
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,680
You will be at peace.

152
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,220
How dare a minor evil spirit play tricks on me?

153
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,630
Did Ma Wang send you? Is it the heavens?

154
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,420
Why is everyone so eager to take this off?

155
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,630
- You said you were hurting.
- My heart is hurting.

156
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,210
When it hurts like crazy, I'm able to barely endure it due to the Geumganggo that is connected to it.

157
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,890
You're mistaken. You are hurting because of the Geumganggo.

158
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,680
It won't hurt if you don't wear it.

159
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,080
- I'll take it off for you.
- You said you put it on, right?

160
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,980
What happened afterwards?

161
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,440
An enormously happy occasion close to a miracle happened.

162
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,840
Me falling in love with you.

163
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,320
Thanks to that, I came to love you like crazy.

164
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,550
How about it? Can you believe me now?

165
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,920
Will Jin Seon Mi be able to piece together the Great Sage's memory

166
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,450
and take off the Geumganggo in one day?

167
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,760
His temper has gotten worse so he probably won't even let her touch it.

168
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,760
When I went to Sureumdong and laid a hand on it, I almost became roast pork

169
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,770
I also occasionally drop by just to give him his meals.

170
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,530
He barely speaks.

171
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,970
Is it really good for the Great Sage to piece together his memories?

172
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,290
I'm afraid that those memories will increase his pain.

173
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,900
If those memories are remorseful, it will be more difficult.

174
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,580
The Jade Dragon, I mean, is it Alice?

175
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,880
It seems like you're all okay now.

176
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,180
I saw the article about you working on a new project.

177
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,740
But what brings you here?

178
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,120
They say I collapsed on set and lost my recent memory.

179
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,160
But I don't understand the things I did recently.

180
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,210
Well, that is... I chased Alice around and it became a scandal.

181
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,000
Alice didn't like me so we broke up quickly.

182
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,810
But for this to be me, there's a really strange picture.

183
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,340
Prince is drunk again.

184
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,580
Octopus, stop moving limply!

185
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,290
Bu Ja, support her.

186
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,550
Yes, Jeo Pal Gye.

187
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,470
Here, here. Hold, hold, hold.

188
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,260
Hold her, hold her.

189
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

190
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,060
Prince, your cellphone.

191
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,640
- Bring it.
- Summer Fairy, let's take a photo together.

192
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,990
Take a picture of us to send to the dragon sea palace.

193
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,630
Prince, the Dragon King will get mad.

194
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,510
- Now.
- Hey, you octopus with a nasty personality.

195
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm taking the photo. Now then.

196
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,930
Hurry up already.

197
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,480
Now, say pig.

198
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,810
Pig.

199
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm the only one left.

200
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,200
PK?

201
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,790
Ugh, the rotting smell.

202
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,670
All my power disappeared.

203
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,320
Is it because Sam Jang died?

204
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,420
I keep rotting but I can't even die.

205
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,390
Gosh.

206
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,620
[Downfall of Kang Dae Seong! Korea Foundation's black money moved academic, media, and legal circles]

207
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,720
That evil man Kang Dae Seong drew you, the evil spirit, to him.

208
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,850
I really am an evil spirit.

209
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,450
It'd be better if someone could burn me.

210
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,280
I just used the foundation's money temporarily. It wasn't embezzlement.

211
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,260
M Group stabbed us in the back. I definitely received their promise for sponsorship.

212
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,880
All of you also saw him at the party.

213
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,820
Are you still talking about that young man?

214
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,360
After the party that day, no one could meet him.

215
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,130
Everyone is wondering if we were fooled by you.

216
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,280
Where do you think all that money went?

217
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,390
Among the dead reporter's personal items was a medal of merit

218
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,630
from the Japanese Emperor which reveals Korea Foundation's pro-Japanese deeds.

219
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,270
We can't cover it up any longer.

220
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,630
On the day she died, I got rid of it from this house with my own hands.

221
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,400
So how can that come out of there?!

222
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,050
Now, now. Professor Kang, have a glass of alcohol while you cool off.

223
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,080
We can't all fall apart like this.

224
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,300
Back then, I should have put her in the container and thrown it into the ocean.

225
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,620
Throw it out!

226
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,390
Load this sarcophagus up in a container and throw it out in the middle of the ocean.

227
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,130
Yes, sir.

228
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,770
Before the heavens could punish him, they took care of it among themselves.

229
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:07,270
In that way, they will kill each other and be ruined.

230
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,260
As the black dragon created from collected stagnant evil disappeared,

231
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,730
the world's energy was purified.

232
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,610
It's due to Sam Jang's huge sacrifice.

233
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:26,430
I hope the next dragon is a golden one that sparkles like a gold nugget.

234
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:32,020
Jin Seon Mi has to take off Oh Gong's Geumganggo quickly.

235
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,230
There isn't much time.

236
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,810
You said you chased me around like crazy because you loved me?

237
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:52,040
That's right. I put this on you and kept you near me so you couldn't run away.

238
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,370
Now I'll take it off for you.

239
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,080
Forget it.

240
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,010
There's no way I would've been trapped by a lowly human

241
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,740
and be unable to run away just because you put this on me.

242
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,080
I really was detaining you.

243
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,250
How so?

244
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,490
I always told you I loved you and that you were handsome.

245
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,820
I chased you around and flirted with you.

246
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,960
You did such pathetic things? You must not have any pride.

247
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,940
That's right. I also activated this.

248
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,110
So I really am the owner.

249
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,080
Activate? How?

250
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,110
Then try activating it again.

251
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,420
Then it will clearly determine whether you are truly the owner or not.

252
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,300
I told you I flirted with you.

253
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,870
It was all done by me. I'll take it with me.

254
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,960
Activate my ass.

255
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,310
You're saying that you activated the Geumganggo like that?

256
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,640
This won't be enough to activate it.

257
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,520
Does it hurt?

258
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,950
Get out. Stop spouting nonsense and get lost.

259
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,740
Get out!

260
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,780
Just looking at you hurting makes me tear up.

261
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,650
If this isn't love, what else could it be?

262
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,060
Come out from here.

263
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,240
If you come out from here, I will make you believe that what I'm saying is true.

264
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,110
I'll wait outside for you.

265
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,940
He needs to come out. There's not much time left.

266
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,680
It is a star that allows you to enter the human world for exactly one day.

267
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Please be sure to take off the Great Sage's Geumganggo.

268
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,710
You're the one that's locking me up now.

269
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,340
I'd like it if you disappeared.

270
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,850
It looks like everything that minor evil spirit said is actually true.

271
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,260
Come out from here.

272
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,730
What?

273
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,020
Hey... this is the brat's clothes, right?

274
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,180
Looking at how it's hung on here even more rudely,

275
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,390
it's definitely his doing.

276
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,270
Son Oh Gong!

277
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,560
Hey, you've crawled out of there now?

278
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,910
Yes. The bathtub in this house is nice.

279
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,320
It's familiar. I must have used it often.

280
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,650
That's right. You've never cleaned up after taking a bath,

281
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,430
so there used to be soap all over the floor.

282
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,410
More than once, I slipped there and almost cracked my head open.

283
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,710
- Do you remember?
- Is that right?

284
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,870
That must be true. It's exactly how I left the bathroom today.

285
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,710
This thug, you haven't changed a bit. You even hung this on my bull statue.

286
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,360
You don't care to respect the person you live with.

287
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,470
Just because you don't pay for it, you've turned it up like crazy.

288
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,680
This hot heat from the boiler!

289
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,520
It's good to see you, Son Oh Gong.

290
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,570
Ma Wang, were you the one who sent the minor evil spirit?

291
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,430
- A minor evil spirit?
- Yeah.

292
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,430
A minor evil spirit came saying she will take this off.

293
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,150
Ah, you met her?

294
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,270
Does she just look like a minor evil spirit to you?

295
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,340
She asked me to come out, so I did.

296
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,120
That's right. That woman is not just a minor evil spirit.

297
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,860
You know that woman too, Ma Wang?

298
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,100
I heard she followed me around like crazy because she loved me.

299
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,030
Is that right?

300
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,640
You find it, Son Oh Gong.

301
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,330
When you put the pieces of your memory together,

302
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,310
you will be able to take off this Geumganggo.

303
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,100
Lee Han Joo must be cleaning up here because I died.

304
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,320
It'd be nice if this place would continue to exist.

305
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,250
If I show myself, he'll be shocked.

306
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,570
[Hanbit Real Estate]

307
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,580
CEO, I thought you were just going to visit your hometown.

308
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,810
Huh, no one's here.

309
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,840
CEO?

310
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,820
Lee Han Joo.

311
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,130
Han Joo. Han Joo.

312
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,860
It's too scary. I have to faint.

313
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,070
I have to faint. Faint, faint!

314
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,140
I have to faint. Sheesh!

315
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,400
Han Joo, I'm sorry.

316

Sheesh, I hit myself too hard.

317
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,850
I must not have woken up completely from fainting.

318
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,200
You're done fainting.

319
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,850
Wake up and let's talk, Lee Han Joo.

320
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,150
Wait... Why are you here, Chairman?

321
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:41,680
Lucifer Entertainment was supposed to take care of Jin Seon Mi's estate, but we're a little late.

322
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,830
Ah, that's right. You're my CEO's agency.

323
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,640
She was just going to visit her hometown.

324
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,790
How did she get into a car accident?

325
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,730
There wasn't even a proper funeral.

326
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,340
Jin Seon Mi is resting in peace. Don't cry.

327
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,180
I'm sure she wants her co-worker to live well.

328
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:16,850
Jin Seon Mi wanted Hanbit Real Estate

329
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,540
to be taken over by you.

330
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,250
- Excuse me?
- Secretary Ma, the contract.

331
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,400
[Transfer of Property]

332
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,450
When you sign here, this building's second floor, Hanbit Real Estate, will be under your ownership.

333
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,500
And the rest of the inheritance will be given to charity.

334
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,890
Wait... She's giving this to me?

335
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,890
She wants you to continue to be a good person.

336
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:55,460
And she'd like to see you crying happily when Han Byeol gets married.

337
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,950
CEO.

338
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,980
CEO.

339
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,960
CEO.

340
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,230
I miss you.

341
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,860
Ma Wang.

342
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,370
I'm not crying.

343
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,400
I must have gotten dust in it. My eye stings.

344
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,180
Your eyeglass lenses are black because we're outside, so I can't really tell.

345
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:50,220
I told Son Oh Gong to go to the place where he goes most often.

346
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,980
So he'll probably run into Jin Seon Mi's soul at home.

347
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,450
What?

348
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,650
It's not time for flowers to bloom yet. Where do you think these flower petals came from?

349
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,210
Ja Eun liked cherry blossoms.

350
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,100
That she was reborn as a flower in this lifetime...

351
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,650
is she telling this news to me first?

352
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,920
♫ I don't even remember when it began ♫

353
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,520
♫ When I went to you ♫

354
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,350
♫ Your heart which kept me from sleeping ♫

355
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,280
♫ Made my heart fall though the floor ♫

356
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,810
Stubborn wench.

357
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:50,940
♫ Although your smile is so bright it hurts ♫

358
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,260
♫ I never felt that way ♫

359
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm the Great Sage, the equal of heaven.

360
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,650
I'm not someone who should be cleaning up after a mere human all day.

361
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,710
I got caught in an unbelievable situation.

362
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:16,110
♫ The tough days you waited for me ♫

363
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,100
You really... came to save me?

364
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,990
No. I came to eat you.

365
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,550
Minor evil spirit, everything you said must be true.

366
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,510
You held onto me but I pushed you off.

367
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,650
- So that's why you put this on me?
- That's right.

368
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,700
It seems like I was very mean to you.

369
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,250
It figures. That's how I am normally, so I'm not that sorry.

370
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,330
- However, why does it hurt?
- Son Oh Gong.

371
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,880
I only have one day.

372
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,820
Is that a star that lives for only one day?

373
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,860
You said you liked me a great deal and chased after me,

374
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,910
but you're only here for a day to wrap things up?

375
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,790
I did like you a lot.

376
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,410
I liked you enough to hang stars in the sky.

377
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,380
How could a minor evil spirit like you hang stars in the sky?

378
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,520
There isn't much time, so let's take it off quickly.

379
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,010
Forget it.

380
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,510
I thought you believed me. What do you mean by "forget it"?

381
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,210
You said you have one day. One day is really long.

382
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,860
It's not even lunch time.

383
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,750
- I need to go explore some more.
- Where?

384
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,070
I'm hungry. What should I eat?

385
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,040
You said you followed me around relentlessly.

386
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,500
Then you should know what I would eat.

387
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,820
My memory is gone. Lead the way.

388
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,590
Alright. There's still time left in the day.

389
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,130
Here.

390
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,480
I liked this sort of thing?

391
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,960
You liked it, so I brought you here everyday and bought it for you.

392
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,170
- It looks spicy.
- You liked it because it's spicy.

393
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,940
If I eat this and don't like it at all, I'm getting rid of all the spicy rice cakes in the world.

394
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,510
If spicy rice cakes cease to exist, it's all your fault, minor evil spirit.

395
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,180
That's right, you could do that. I was playing around. Don't eat it.

396
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,410
Spicy rice cakes can't cease to exist.

397
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,280
It's really spicy, right? Are you mad?

398
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,260
It's not bad.

399
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,580
That's a relief. You don't like spicy foods.

400
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,390
It's true. I don't like it.

401
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,360
But it does feel good chatting like this with you.

402
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,380
Perhaps it's because I feel sorry for all the bad things I've done?

403
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,830
But I'm not that kind of guy.

404
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,060
It's a relief that spicy rice cakes are safe.

405
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,400
I'll go back and get the milder ones that you like.

406
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:49,550
That's right. Let's fill up the whole day and do everything I like before leaving.

407
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,190
I feel sorry towards her?

408
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,680
Is that why it hurts?

409
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,350
Ma Wang, you're here.

410
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,080
- Your grandma isn't here today either?
- No.

411
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,460
Why would a hard working person like her

412
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,220
not report about the Geumganggo to the heavens?

413
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,440
Instead of coming here for nothing every time,

414
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,180
call me before you come.

415
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,170
Do you want me to give you my number? Do you want to open a chat room with me?

416
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,270
At this rate, you're going to open yourself up to informal speech with me.

417
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,140
It's mushroom porridge.

418
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,420
Yes. I'm eating it since I'm hungry,

419
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,580
but this restaurant's mushroom porridge isn't good.

420
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,580
The mushroom porridge from Yeouido is the best.

421
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,780
Grandma Sim Tong's Porridge House in Yeouido?

422
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,990
You know about it?

423
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,540
I'm a regular there. Their pine mushroom porridge is delicious.

424
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,890
That one is expensive. The pine nut porridge is good too.

425
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,650
For pine nut porridge, you go to Daebang-dong.

426
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,840
In Yeouido, you get pine mushroom porridge.

427
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,090
Then next time, come with pine mushroom porridge please.

428
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,050
You have a big mouth but you have excellent taste.

429
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,800
Okay, let's open a chat room.

430
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,960
When your grandmother comes back, contact me quickly.

431
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,660
- Cool, right? I took it.
- You did?

432
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes. There was a night when a whole bunch of stars fell in one swoop last time.

433
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,620
It was so cold that day but Grandma called me

434
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,240
and told me to go outside and show my respect to the falling stars.

435
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,920
She said she'd kill me if I didn't.

436
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,730
She said to give your respect to the falling stars?

437
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,860
Yes. I was asked to take a photo as proof so I took it and sent it.

438
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,850
I thought I was going to freeze to death,

439
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,000
but the picture is kind of cool, right?

440
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,450
The stars which fell that day were

441
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,020
the stars of the fate of a woman I know.

442
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,440
Give me your number.

443
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,020
The flowers bloomed, right? I see that you saw it, too.

444
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,820
Huh?

445
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,650
I saw it today too.

446
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,760
I stayed at the arcade all night and when I left in the morning,

447
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,200
the petals were flying in the air.

448
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,650
Flowers must already be blooming somewhere.

449
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,630
Isn't it amazing?

450
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,790
Your number?

451
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,930
You...

452
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,540
What is your name?

453
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,560
Hong Hae Ah.

454
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,850
Hong Hae Ah. You can save it as that.

455
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,950
Is the child's name...

456
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,530
Hong Hae Ah?

457
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,370
If you find him and his existence becomes known,

458
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,120
he'll become a target of the heavens.

459
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,860
They'll do whatever it takes to get rid of him.

460
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,940
- You've worked hard.
- Yes, you've worked hard.

461
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,890
- Did the shoot finish well?
- Great! Good job.

462
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,390
Good work.

463
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,830
There's a strange rotting smell in the dressing room.

464
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,630
Did someone eat something and not clean up after?

465
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,410
It smells so bad.

466
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,490
It was fine when I left.

467
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,490
Well, let's clean it up.

468
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,210
Oh, it really does smell disgusting.

469
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,680
I told you so.

470
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,040
Oh, the stench.

471
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,160
What is that?

472
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,570
Who are you?

473
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,100
- Do you know who it is?
- I don't.

474
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,010
Just a moment.

475
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,750
This is my friend. She must have come to see me for a short while.

476
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,200
We need to talk so would you excuse us for a moment?

477
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,010
Okay.

478
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,660
I didn't do that for you.

479
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,970
They all know how Bu Ja looks.

480
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,460
It's because I don't want Bu Ja to appear as a weird person.

481
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,300
I came to steal some energy beads.

482
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,200
Will you give me some?

483
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,730
- Wait.
- Are you an idiot?

484
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,090
It's not on your behalf.

485
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,290
Then on her behalf,

486
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,520
will you burn me?

487
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,790
After Sam Jang died, I keep rotting like this.

488
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,950
I don't even have the strength to capture and eat something.

489
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,210
Burn and get rid of me.

490
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,940
Here seems to be fine.

491
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,020
Now, I beg you.

492
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,210
Please don't struggle.

493
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:06,010
Bu Ja totally disappeared before she became an evil spirit.

494
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,900
The only one left in this body is me.

495
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,690
I know.

496
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,110
I'm not struggling because of you.

497
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:20,300
♫ Even though it's painful, I'm not going to hurt ♫

498
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,140
♫ And I'll grit my teeth like this ♫

499
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:30,830
♫ I'll hold back my tears. Don't worry ♫

500
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,240
Should I relay the final words

501
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,980
Bu Ja left for you?

502
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,070
I liked you.

503
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:51,830
♫ I'm fine. I'm used to seeing you leave ♫

504
00:44:51,900 --> 00:45:01,400
♫ Here where I watch you going far away is my place ♫

505
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,950
♫ But then why do I only want to keep calling out to you ♫

506
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:16,820
♫ Why don't you turn around just once ♫

507
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:24,170
♫ Anyway, it's already been decided ♫

508
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,370
Now there aren't many hours left.

509
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,330
I don't know if she'll be able to take off Oh Gong's Geumganggo.

510
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:33,770
For Jin Seon Mi, whether or not she takes off the Geumganggo,

511
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,910
she won't be able to hear the truth now.

512
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:38,730
She wanted to know.

513
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,830
She can know.

514
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,310
If Son Oh Gong pieces his memory together,

515
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,050
Jin Seon Mi will be able to hear Son Oh Gong's sincerity.

516
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,010
How?

517
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,770
I'm not telling you.

518
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,930
There were many things you didn't tell me also.

519
00:45:57,930 --> 00:45:59,630
Why would I tell you?

520
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,610
There's nothing I'm hiding from you now.

521
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,250
Ask me anything!

522
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,720
Then, I'll ask you one thing.

523
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:17,670
Has Ja Eun reincarnated as a flower?

524
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,520
I need to stretch.
("O" symbolizes yes.)

525
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,090
I see.

526
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,390
Now then, Ma Wang, you should also

527
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,210
tell me what you mean by Jin Seon Mi being able to hear the truth.

528
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,310
In the past, Son Oh Gong already

529
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,260
took off the Geumganggo on his own.

530
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,950
If he pieces together his memory, he will take off the Geumganggo and

531
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:09,770
he will be able to tell Jin Seon Mi what he wanted to say.

532
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,300
It's something you liked. Try it.

533
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,250
You said you chased me because you liked me to death.

534
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,740
Spicy rice cakes, cotton candy.

535
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,390
These are the only things I liked?

536
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,650
- There were many places we visited together.
- Where?

537
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,490
We went to the library and the museum.

538
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,210
- We also went to the bookstore.
- To study together?

539
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,200
No. To catch evil spirits.

540
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,770
We also went to a club and the supermarket.

541
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,560
We even went to a love motel.

542
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,740
I don't think we went to dance, buy groceries, or make love.

543
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,840
Right, we caught evil spirits.

544
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,470
So all that chasing because you liked me to death ended up

545
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,700
not as dates but catching ghosts together?

546
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,200
That's right. If you bring up memories of evil spirits as the central point,

547
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,460
you will be able to remember a little.

548
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,790
Forget it. So you're saying the only place I liked

549
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,760
as I ate cotton candy is here?

550
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,270
To be honest, this is also...

551
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,460
I got it, forget it. We probably came to catch an evil spirit.

552
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,230
Son Oh Gong.

553
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,200
Son Oh Gong.

554
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,480
Son Oh Gong!

555
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,040
Son Oh Gong. Son Oh Gong. Son Oh Gong.

556
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,400
Protect him.

557
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,170
Son Oh Gong.

558
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,950
Are you okay?

559
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,710
This is the first time

560
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,970
several things popped into my mind so vividly.

561
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,910
You really did a good job of ordering me around, didn't you?

562
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,690
You protected me.

563
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,700
I did? You?

564
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,490
Whenever I was scared, struggling, or in danger,

565
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,470
when I called your name,

566
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,010
you would always come because of a contract we made.

567
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,850
Do you now believe that I am the owner of the Geumganggo?

568
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,040
Want me to take it off?

569
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,450
How can I believe you who ordered me around to catch evil spirits?

570
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,640
It would be good to take it off at this point.

571
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,880
I don't have much time either.

572
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,610
It's good for you to remember up to this point.

573
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:39,970
Why? If I remember all, is there some memory that is

574
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,600
extremely embarrassing, awkward, and shameful?

575
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah. There is. Because I even hung a star in the sky for you.

576
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,280
Good thing that I put it up there.

577
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,480
What?

578
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,630
Just watch the stars.

579
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,020
Okay.

580
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,990
Right... I should make love.

581
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,830
What are you doing? Making my heart flutter...

582
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:22,110
You can marry me too.

583
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,600
No matter how many times you become my bride, I'll always accept you.

584
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,240
You just got here? I missed you.

585
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,290
♫ Even if you are a little late, it's okay. I understand ♫

586
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,300
Everyone walks like this.

587
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,700
I'm scared.

588
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,580
Like that other time, I might hurt you again. I'm scared.

589
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,080
Just hold onto me tightly. Then we'll be fine.

590
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,350
I want to keep loving you.

591
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,610
This is of my own free will.

592
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:54,420
When I'm scared, suffering, or in danger,

593
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,710
I'll call for Jin Seon Mi.

594
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,690
♫ Would you see me somewhere ♫

595
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:06,640
♫ Have you lost me, whom you wanted to see ♫

596
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,740
What's wrong? Did you remember something?

597
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,840
♫ I long for you, the only one who cannot be replaced ♫

598
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,920
There's something you're not telling me, right?

599
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,100
Are you sure that it was only you who liked me and chased me around?

600
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:28,840
♫ Each day, even if it hurts, I'll believe in you ♫

601
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,320
I think it was me

602
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,340
who loved you so much that I put a star in the sky for you.

603
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,290
What's going on?

604
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,770
You're only like that because of the Geumganggo.

605
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,150
It's not real.

606
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,360
That's why I came to take it off.

607
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:01,760
When that disappears, your pain will also disappear.

608
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,940
Okay.

609
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,330
Fine, try taking it off.

610
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,720
It won't come off.

611
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,800
Why won't it come off?

612
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,060
I put it on you. They said only I could take it off.

613
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,290
You're wrong. Are you sure you got it right?

614
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,070
Me being in pain...

615
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,260
are you sure it's because of the feelings that this created?

616
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,110
Are you sure my feelings can disappear with it?

617
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,500
I don't know.

618
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,490
Honestly, I don't know either.

619
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:14,090
Because I've not once seen your true feelings without the Geumganggo.

620
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,860
I honestly don't know whether your pain is a real pain

621
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,100
or a fake pain because of the Geumganggo.

622
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,220
You volunteered to take this off when you didn't even know a thing about it?

623
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,040
Because that's what I believed.

624
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,670
I believed that when that disappeared, your feelings would also disappear.

625
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,780
Well anyway, you failed.

626
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,800
You couldn't take this off.

627
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,180
The day is almost over.

628
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,150
Go well.

629
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,370
Why won't the Geumganggo come off?

630
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,890
She couldn't take it off?

631
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,300
That woman couldn't take it off. She actually didn't know anything.

632
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,790
Because you haven't pieced together all your memories, it can't be taken off.

633
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,500
I remembered a lot of things. I was sorry towards her and...

634
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,600
happy with her. That's what I remember.

635
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,300
But I keep feeling pain.

636
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,320
Of course, you're in pain.

637
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,960
You can't not be in pain

638
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,410
because that woman died.

639
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,990
Among your broken memories, that's the most important one.

640
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:04,430
Son Oh Gong, if you've come this far, go until the end.

641
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,920
If you find it, you'll be able to take off the Geumgganggo.

642
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,710
The sword I have to use to kill Sam Jang...

643
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:34,010
Don't ever come out into this world again.

644
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,710
Please lend me that sword.

645
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,570
I want to end this already.

646
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:50,560
Without that, it's too painful for me to endure this long life alone.

647
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,490
If one disappears and one ends up alone,

648
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,070
I think the one left behind will be sadder.

649
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,090
♫ It can't be changed ♫

650
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:11,610
It will be more painful as the time left to live is indefinitely long.

651
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,270
♫ Like the night when even the moonlight is hidden behind the clouds ♫

652
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,750
Because there is the Geumgganggo, I'm reassured.

653
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,800
♫ My heart is turning black ♫

654
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,050
It's a relief that when you're left by yourself,

655
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,390
♫ I am boxing up the longing in the pouring rain and letting it go ♫

656
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:33,080
love won't be left behind.

657
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,040
♫ I am afraid you might forget me ♫

658
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,770
Jin Seon Mi.

659
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:45,250
♫ If it were destiny, I will accept it ♫

660
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:52,170
♫ If so-called love becomes a sin ♫

661
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,760
♫ I will be able to see you again ♫

662
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,330
Jin Seon Mi.

663
00:56:56,330 --> 00:57:01,090
♫ If you truly love ♫

664
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,500
Because you heard her last words, your heart must be even more distressed.

665
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,780
Would it have been better if you didn't know?

666
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,220
No. I won't think like that.

667
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,700
If that's how Bu Ja feels about me,

668
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,800
even though I am sad, I'm happy.

669
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,690
If it's the other case, I feel pity for her.

670
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,920
The day is ending soon.

671
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,360
Soon Sam Jang will be going back to the underworld.

672
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,410
Yeah.

673
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:36,510
Sam Jang will be leaving without knowing the Great Sage's true feelings.

674
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,450
She heard them once.

675
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,800
On a very cold day when it snowed for a moment,

676
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,000
there was definitely a time when she heard his true feelings.

677
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,790
You came back.

678
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,790
I wanted to see you one more time before I left.

679
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,820
So I'm glad.

680
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,820
Jin Seon Mi.

681
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:28,650
You remember my name?

682
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:36,320
Yes. I also remember your last words to me.

683
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,020
You said it was a relief that there was the Geumgganggo.

684
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,560
You said that when I'm left alone,

685
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,720
it's a relief that love won't be left behind.

686
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:52,340
With those same feelings,

687
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,580
I hid something from you.

688
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,250
If you want to ask me something, ask me now.

689
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,130
Even though you didn't want to leave anything behind...

690
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,320
still, just ask.

691
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,510
Please ask.

692
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,430
Am I... pretty even now?

693
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:44,380
Yeah, you're pretty.

694
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Because I love you.

695
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,150
♫ When I saw you ♫

696
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,740
♫ I think only about you ♫

♫ When I love you ♫

698

Nothing disappeared.

699
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,890
♫ Did you miss me ♫

700
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,620
I love you.

701

♫ Even if my feelings change ♫

702
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,160
♫ I will ♫

703
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,390
Time's up.

704
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,520
I have to go back.

705
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,120
♫ Can we go back ♫

706
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,440
I'm leaving you behind by yourself. What should I do?

707
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,260
I won't send you off just like this.

708
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,230
Jin Seon Mi.

709
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,310
Don't move. I have something for you.

710
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,490
♫ Close your eyes ♫

711
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,920
♫ Just seeing the back of my head leaving ♫

712
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,080
♫ When I leave you ♫

713
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,750
♫ Are you with me ♫

714
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,730
♫ Even if the world hates us ♫

715
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:25,380
Now you have one of the Great Sage Son Oh Gong's golden-gaze fiery-eyes.

716
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,350
♫ Can we go back ♫

717
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:35,350
You gave me one of your eyes?

718
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,780
Jin Seon Mi, listen well.

719
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:40,600
I will come find you.

720
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,460
No matter where you are or how you've changed,

721
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:48,620
I will be able to recognize you now.

722
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,770
Remember my name.

723
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,350
I will definitely find you.

724
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,710
I will wait for you.

725
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:02,890
If I call for you, you'll come no matter where I am.

726
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,110
I definitely won't forget your name. I'll wait for you.

727
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:13,140
We will definitely meet again.

728
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,210
♫ Can we go back ♫

729
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,940

730
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,270
Time's up.

731
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,860
♫ Always behind of you ♫

♫ Always behind of you ♫

733
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,490
Go.

734
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,790
♫ I will bury it in the fading memory ♫

735
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,860
♫ I'll live according to that memory ♫

♫ Always behind of you ♫

741
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,760
This is the shopping center I told you about.

742
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:38,410
This is the shopping center where every new renter sees ghosts, isn't it?

743
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,440
They can't endure longer than a month and leave.

744
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,690
I trust Hanbit Real Estate will take care of it.

745
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,370
I'm a successor with an instinct.

746
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:56,150
I will change it into a bright and clear shopping center.

747
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,430
- Please step out.
- Okay.

748
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,920
I heard the CEO of their real estate company changed.

749
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,450
That person can't see us.

750
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,700
Really?

751
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,510
We don't have to move.

752
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,960
Really?

753
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,750
There's nothing there, right? Umbrella, I only trust in you. I trust you.

754
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,160
Oh gosh.

755
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,460
I am too scared so I can't go back there.

756
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,400
You're a first-time customer.

757
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,760
Yes.

758
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,560
So there was a bar like this here.

759
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,580
This isn't an easy place to find.

760
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,980
I see it was because of that.

761
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,730
Oh, this?

762
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,950
This is my late CEO's umbrella.

763
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,350
I see.

764
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:37,780
My CEO was a very special person.

765
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,310
When she was around,

766
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:50,370
so many big shots visited our real estate office.

767
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:57,340
Lucifer Entertainment's chairman would come often to see her.

768
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,150
Top stars came a couple of times, too.

769
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,350
They were close.

770
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,520
One day, M Group's chairman came to see her too.

771
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:17,240
More than anything, the most mysterious and extraordinary human

772
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:24,270
was that man who loved my CEO.

773
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:40,110
Why would those people be around my CEO?

774
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:47,630
Maybe she wasn't human.

775
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,480
Maybe it's the opposite.

776
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,980
Only your CEO was human.

777
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,110
It's possible that the rest weren't human but demons.

778
01:06:57,110 --> 01:07:00,220
Why are you saying something so scary?

779
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,270
I went to a haunted house today.

780
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,840
I won't be able to sleep.

781
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,780
I have to get drunk. I have to get drunk. So scary.

782
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:24,200
I bought all of this land that was owned by the Korea Foundation.

783
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,790
This is a haunted place where evil spirits gathered and became stagnant.

784
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,370
Although I wiped this place clean, they'll gather again.

785
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,130
That's exactly what I went after.

786
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,930
I'm going to build a hotel here.

787
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,720
- Right above that cliff, very magnificently.
- A hotel?

788
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,140
There's something I learned by watching CEO Jin Seon Mi's business policy.

789
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,100
You have to showcase your special ability.

790
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,850
Imagine building a hotel here. A lot of evil spirits will show up.

791
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,360
I suppose so.

792
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,750
If I capture all of them, I'll rack up lots of points.

793
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,230
In one place, I can earn money through a hotel

794
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,090
and collect points through evil spirits.

795
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,680
Ah, holy moly.

796
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,550
I knew you had a crafty mind

797
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,970
when you started the entertainment business and sucked up human energy through energy beads.

798
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:11,600
A hotel that receives evil spirits? I'm not going.

799
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,700
Come by once in a while. Once in a while.

800
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,740
I'll save a room with a large bathtub and three parking spaces for you.

801
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,950
Depends on how well you build the hotel.

802
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:23,370
If it turns out to be shabby, I won't go. Build it nicely.

803
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,510
My path to become a deity by racking up points one by one

804
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:31,130
somehow became grand after you guys interfered.

805
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,170
That's not it. Did we interfere in Sam Jang's grand path?

806
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:39,020
Although it's a path that I was forced into against my will,

807
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:46,130
in the end, being here with you feels nice.

808
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:54,350
The fact that the darkness here is gone and it has become bright is because of you.

809
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:58,640
Amazing. You looked cool.

810
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,780
See, that's why I can't regret it even if I want to

811
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:07,430
because you completely fell in love with me.

812
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,950
You're going to be so bored without me. What are you going to do?

813
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,370
What? Are you going somewhere?

814
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,800
I should continue on my way.

815
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,840
There is someone waiting for me, so I need to go.

816
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,570
Okay. Go on your way.

817
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:29,640
I should continue on my way.

818
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,130
For that child.

819
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:39,360
Ma Wang, let's meet again in the middle of our journey.

820
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:02,200
[Secretary Ma]

821
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,320
Where is he right now?

822
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,060
He set up a sale booth on the corner of Chinatown.

823
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,960
Okay. Don't raid him yet. Just watch over him.

824
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:19,220
This little rascal.

825
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:33,580
Gosh, you're here to catch me again?

826
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:36,280
Yes, every time I catch you,

827
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,380
I get quite a few points.

828
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,700
I only brought a few pathetic amulets to sell today.

829
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,180
- Close your sales box.
- Aren't you busy?

830
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:49,710
When there are plenty of evil spirits, why are you only after me?

831
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:55,950
Instead of stealing things from the shop to sell, find a job.

832
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,780
What?

833
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:02,130
I'm thinking of ending my entertainment business and building a hotel.

834
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,940
Go ask your grandma.

835
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:07,490
If she says it's okay, come and work for me.

836
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,240
What would you have me do?

837
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,700
- Clean the bathrooms.
- I don't want to.

838
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,980
Did you eat? There's a porridge restaurant ahead.

839
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,460
If you're going to buy me pine nut porridge, I've already eaten.

840
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,930
If you're going to buy me pine mushroom porridge, I haven't.

841
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:22,490
- Of course you have to eat pine nut porridge.
- I don't want to.

842
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:24,420
- Vegetable porridge.
- I don't want to!

843
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,540
Why are there so many things you don't like?

844
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:31,210
- Then how about abalone porridge?
- No!

845
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:34,160
Hey, who do you take after?

846
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,040
Grandma says I take after my dad a little.

847
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,250
Your dad must have been a very handsome man.

848
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,400
Really? I don't think so.

849
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,260
Looking at you, I can tell he must be handsome.

850
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,570
I don't know.

851
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,030

858
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,520
You've come.

859
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,020
Where's Son Oh Gong?

860
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:29,910
Yes. He said he is going on a trip, so he packed up his stuff and left.

861
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,490
I see, he left.

862
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,250
Seeing that he took his statue with him,

863
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,020
he must have gone to a very far place.

864
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,360
He says he's going to the underworld to get Jin Seon Mi.

865
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,320
To the underworld? The land of the dead?

866
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:53,920
Gosh, how much chaos is this thug going to create in the underworld?!

867
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,920
Gosh, really.

868
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:11,420
That's right. Give it a go.

869
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,530
The Great Sage, the nut job!

870
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:41,710
Wait.

871
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:46,090
When you're struggling, scared, or in danger, and you call my name,

872
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:51,020
I will always run to you and protect you.

873
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,070
Because I love you.

874
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:56,880
♫ The more I try to push you out, the more I think of you ♫

875
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,300
♫ Even if I close my eyes, I see you clearly ♫

876
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,430
♫ Let me out ♫

877
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:08,370
♫ Why don't you let me go ♫

878
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:12,000
♫ You wanna hold me down ♫

879
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,820
♫ Go away, go away ♫

880
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,520
♫ I want to get away from you ♫

881
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,230
♫ I am getting closer as though I were drawn ♫

882
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,840

883

♫ Leave me alone for just a while ♫

886
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:49,460
♫ Give to me a little time ♫

887

♫ Like a shadow in front of me ♫

888
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:58,580
♫ I can't break away from you, I still long for your breath ♫

889
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,670
♫ Let me out ♫

890
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:04,570
♫ I can't leave ♫

891
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:08,290
♫ If you see me ♫

892
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:12,050
♫ No way, no way ♫

893
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:16,510
♫ You gotta let me out ♫
