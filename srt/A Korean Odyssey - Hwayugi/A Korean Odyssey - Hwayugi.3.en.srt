[Oh Yeon Seo, Lee Hong Gi]

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,830
So... you called me after all.

5
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,180
You really came.

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,070
Wow. Did you do all this? Amazing.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,520
Thanks to me being amazing, you didn't die.

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,700
I warned you. That your blood is dangerous.

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,090
I was told I had to be in danger for you to come protect me.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,420
You came to protect me this time, right? Son Oh Gong.

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,010
If you're going to call me, then call me properly by my full name, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,930
Wow. You're really amazing, Son Oh Gong.

13
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,980
This is driving me crazy. I really can't restrain myself.

14
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,430
You still want to eat me as food?

15
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,370
Oh, that foolish human being has let out Son Oh Gong again.

16
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,640
If the Great Sage eats Sam Jang, he will gain tremendous power.

17
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,590
Woo Ma Wang, there are human workers in this building. Please calm yourself.

18
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,500
If the Great Sage eats up Sam Jang, it's over for us. Let's just run away!

19
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,880
Shut up!

20
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,440
Son Oh Gong! That crazy bastard!

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,320
He has the Geumganggo on him!

22
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,190
Sam Jang has put the Geumganggo on Son Oh Gong!

23
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,390
Is that so?

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,740
Why are you like this when you have the Geumganggo on?

25
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,730
I'm not your food anymore. Don't be like this.

26
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,590
Stop, Son Oh Gong.

27
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,900
Stop. Enough. Stop!

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,640
- What a relief.
- No, there's a huge problem.

29
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,280
You said that what happens after the Geumganggo is put on will be disastrous, right?

30
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,160
I really think... a horrible misfortune has occurred, a calamity.

31
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,320
What happened?

32
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,900
I'm in love with you.

33
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,150
Thanks to this, I think I'm crazily in love with you right now.

34
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,320
What do you think? Something terrible has happened, don't you think?

35
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,840
Before, the Geumganggo was fastened around the head

36
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
to give tremendous pain in order to gain control.

37
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,710
But there was a limit to how much you could control through physical pain.

38
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,710
Then the Geumganggo I found for Sam Jang is a new model so therefore, it's something different?

39
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,120
That Geumganggo is for this.

40
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,600
This meaning... it's fastened around the heart?

41
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,360
That's right. The power that the Geumganggo puts into effect is that of love.

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,570
Love? Love?

43
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,390
Love. Beautiful confinement, blissful obedience.

44
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,430
It's the constraint of love you can't ever breakaway from.

45
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,850
Then while wearing the Geumganggo, Son Oh Gong has become the slave of love protecting Sam Jang?

46
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,620
What are you going to do about me now, huh?

47
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,550
[Episode 3]

48
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,150
I have to go right now to put Pal Gye in his place,

49
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,700
but I can't leave since I keep wanting to see you.

50
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,520
I don't care what happens to you. It's not my fault.

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,830
How is it not your fault? You were the one who gave me this!

52
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,150
You gave it to me and activated it by kissing me, didn't you?!

53
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,970
I didn't know that was going to happen.

54
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,380
Didn't know? How am I supposed to believe that? Prove it.

55
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,420
- How?
- Do it one more time.

56
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,680
Then I'll tell you whether you kissed me knowingly or not.

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,550
Let's go.

58
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,760
I reject. Stop trying to trick me.

59
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,480
Fine. I tricked you. Can't you still do it though? I'll be good.

60
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,970
- Are you a pervert?
- I was being honest since you told me not to trick you. Why are you calling me names?

61
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,210
If you're going to call me names, then kiss me first!

62
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,410
Seriously... so embarrassing.

63
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,000
Huh? Hey, where are you going? Do it before you go! Hey!

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,620
Hey, you must think I'm trying to trick you into kissing me, but rationally, I want to sew my mouth shut, too.

65
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,850
But what can I do?

66
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,150
I fell in love.

67
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,600
It's awful.

68
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,560
Even though you're glaring at me, I still find you beautiful.

69
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,690
What are you going to do with me? Can you handle it?

70
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,180
Can you withstand this love? No, right? If you can't, take this bracelet off.

71
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,830
Why should I take it off for you?

72
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,010
So you're going to deal with it? Then give me a kiss.

73
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,240
Nut case.

74
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,460
I'm the one who's going more crazy!

75
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,030
Even after you offended me by calling me a nut case, I'm still tagging along. Think about how I feel!

76
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,500
Why should I think about your feelings?

77
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,620
Whether you love me or not, that's your issue.

78
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,710
You can't hurt me, and you'll protect me if I'm in danger.

79
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,530
I've got nothing to lose.

80
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,360
Since I don't love you, I couldn't care less.

81
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,620
What's wrong? Are you hurting somewhere?

82
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,310
I've been hurt by someone I love, so of course it hurts.

83
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,860
And here I thought you really were hurt.

84
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,890
Were you worried?

85
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,910
- What do you mean worried?
- But you worried.

86
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,180
Tell me you worried. I think it'll stop hurting then.

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,530
Well, you were locked up and came out looking terrible.

88
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,460
So I just wondered if you got hurt and were in pain, that's all.

89
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,490
I'm the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, Son Oh Gong.

90
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,190
An average pain is just a tickle at best.

91
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,790
Fine. You said you were really strong, right?

92
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,580
No, not just strong.

93
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,830
This is the body of a deity who ate the Queen Mother of the West's peaches of immortality and Daode Tianzun's longevity pill.

94
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,590
I don't feel things like pain.

95
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,430
Oh, it's cold.

96
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,630
Oh... Hey, hand over your scarf.

97
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,530
Give it. It's so cold.

98
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, it's cold. So cold.

99
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,160
You said you didn't feel pain.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
It's excruciatingly cold for me!

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
I was born from a volcanic rock. How cold must I be here when I used to live in a volcano?

102
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,750
And you say you're a deity who ate the peaches of immortality and the longevity pill.

103
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,140
How can you take something from a human who never got to have any herbal medicine while growing up?

104
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,300
Oh, it's so cold. So cold...

105
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,170
Why are you looking at me like that? No, you can't.

106
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,930
If I give you this, too, I'll freeze to death.

107
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,960
I think...

108
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,240
I've definitely become strange.

109
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,400
Giving this back to you even though I'm this cold...

110
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,380
does this make any sense to you? Huh?

111
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,760
Do you think it makes sense?

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,130
My heart hurt all the while I was locked up.

113
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,310
And after returning, as soon as I saw you, I clearly realized...

114
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,380
I was hurting because I wanted to see you so badly.

115
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,110
You should know without seeing my heart, right?

116
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,700
If this isn't love, then what is?

117
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,480
This is a burden to both of us.

118
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,220
So just take this off.

119
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,180
If I take it off, you won't come even when I call for you.

120
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,220
I won't take it off.

121
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,990
It can't be helped then.

122
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,620
I'll come running like a dog whenever you call for me. Go home.

123
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,170
This is a crappy situation.

124
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,380
I'm a monkey, not a dog. What happened?

125
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,900
This embarrassment is making me feel even colder.

126
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,070
No... I can't let down my guard.

127
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,090
I can't be careless.

128
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,590
Oh, dig here too.

129
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,870
Oh, my back.

130
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,130
Hey, hurry up and get to it.

131
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,220
- Hurry.
- We need to dig more on that side.

132
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,950
It's hardened like ice. Oh!

133
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,110
Oh, my back.

134
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, over here too.

135
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,880
Oh.

136
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,580
The roots are in the way.

137
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,470
Hey. Wow.

138
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,900
Hey.

139
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,990
Come on.

140
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,630
Let me drink some water.

141
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,320
Seriously.

142
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,140
Burying a corpse is what I hate most in this world.

143
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,390
- Really.
- Oh, my back.

144
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,450
- Hyungnim!
- What is it?

145
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,550
- The corpse has disappeared.
- Huh?

146
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,240
Hey, where did it go?

147
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,060
This girl... you think she wasn't dead?

148
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,220
What are you saying? From being dead, the corpse was hardened.

149
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,970
- I know.
- For now, let's leave.

150
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,500
Leave. Leave.

151
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,520
Hyungnim, we have to tell the client that the corpse disappeared, right?

152
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,810
If we do, then we'll become corpses. We'll say we buried her well.

153
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah, we buried her, right?

154
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,360
Buried who?

155
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,700
Me?

156
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,550
Oh, no!

157
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,670
So where are we going?

158
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,210
I'm a bit drunk, so...

159
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,740
will you drive?

160
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,460
I'm a newbie driver.

161
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,940
Do you want to practice driving with me? How about doing it in Yangpyeong?

162
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,380
Okay.

163
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,590
Wow, amazing. This is really thoughtless.

164
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:53,020
You have to post these kinds of things online and humiliate them.

165
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,980
I'm going to take the photo so that you can see the plate number crystal clear.

166
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,790
What kind of plate number is 5050?
(Pronounced "oh gong oh gong")

167
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
Oh Gong? That's the car of Oh Gong.

168
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,650
Oh, that shocked me!

169
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,420
Wow, 5050 is really thoughtless!

170
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,930
Oh, wow. Amazing.

171
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,060
Today, in the Gangnam district of Seoul, a large wild boar appeared and put the citizens in a state of fear.

172
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,390
Currently, the wild boar has disappeared, and the police are trying to track it down.

173
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:08,220
This Jeo Pal Gye has betrayed you tremendously, Hyungnim Son Oh Gong.

174
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,330
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,540
Pal Gye, I didn't trust you that much anyway, so I don't feel that betrayed.

176
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,100
I feel wronged. The one who burned the demonic picture...

177
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,150
oops, it was Ma Wang! Right, Sa Oh Jeong?

178
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,290
The one who gave the Geumganggo to Sam Jang was also Woo Ma Wang.

179
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,640
Of course. Since it's not something a human being can get their hands on.

180
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,010
Are you going to fight Ma Wang?

181
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,980
I owe him from long time ago in matters regarding Princess Iron Fan, so we'll call it even now.

182
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,810
It's a relief that the two of you aren't fighting.

183
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,080
But still, I can't let him sleep tonight in peace.

184
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,140
I should send some annoying dung flies his way.

185
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,940
It's been a hundred years.

186
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,430
It's been a long time.

187
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,170
Who told you that I found Sam Jang?

188
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,680
Jae Seok, you got the wrong info. Concentrate on your shoot.
(Yoo Jae Seok)

189
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,040
What do you mean just a bite? I told you that I don't have such thing!

190
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,050
Oh, Hyungnim is calling me from China. Bye. Jeez.

191
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,770
Hello, Hyungnim Seong Chi.
(Stephen Chow)

192
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,440
Why? I don't have Sam Jang.

193
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,710
I don't know.

194
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,550
Sorry, hold on a minute.

195
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,670
What is this? Even Jolie is bothering me! Seriously!
(Angelina Jolie)

196
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,460
Chairman. Chairman.

197
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,480
Chairman, there's a big problem.

198
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,180
What is it?

199
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,300
What happened?

200
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,840
Sa Oh Jeong spread the news that you caught Sam Jang.

201
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,410
Not Sa Oh Jeong but that idiot Son Oh Gong probably put him up to it.

202
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,530
This really has become very bothersome.

203
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,340
I've gathered all of them in the basement's conference room for now.

204
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:23,700
Since this already happened, should we catch Sam Jang and eat her up together?

205
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,200
Secretary Ma, stop drooling. Is your jaw out of its socket?

206
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,650
I apologize.

207
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,700
Ma Wang, there's a peacock...

208
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,630
A peacock?

209
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,430
Oh, Gong Jak, what brings you here?

210
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,650
I heard you've caught Sam Jang.

211
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,790
I came to help you out with a bite.

212
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,600
Weren't you in the middle of a shoot overseas?

213
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,780
Yes, I was in the middle of shooting a chase scene during sunset in the desert of Dubai.

214
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,120
I don't have much time. The staff is waiting.

215
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,610
Before the sun sets, I'll just have one bite then leave.

216
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,840
Gong Jak, I have no intention of cooking Sam Jang and sharing with others.

217
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,100
Go back.

218
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,290
So you're saying you want to eat her all by yourself?

219
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,230
Alright. Eat all of her by yourself.

220
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,280
And give me just a bite.

221
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,090
I told you I don't have it. Go back. The sun's setting in Dubai.

222
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,800
Ma Wang, but you and I are especially close.

223
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,150
Because my powers have weakened, my feathers are not like how they were before. They're getting dull.

224
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,060
Ah, seriously. I got it.

225
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,380
This is my favorite.

226
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,700
Eat this and go back.

227
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,460
[Green grape candy]

228
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,350
Ma Wang! Just one bite!

229
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,720
Gong Jak! Why are you like this?

230
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,830
Here, sit. Sit. Gosh, seriously.

231
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,230
- Ma Wang! Ma Wang!
- Gosh, what are you doing?

232
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,040
- Why are you being so cold-hearted?
- I just gave you a piece.

233
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,060
I'll give you the fan. Huh?

234
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,000
What did you say?

235
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,830
Where are you going?

236
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,470
Ma Wang, you're back.

237
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,270
I've already washed up, so you can use the bathroom now.

238
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,700
I love our house so much.

239
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,690
The bathroom is huge, and the parking spot is huge too. Amazing.

240
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,680
This is not our house; it's mine.

241
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,320
Why are you so uptight?

242
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,210
You must be really tired. A lot of troublesome guys flocked to you, didn't they?

243
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,810
Thanks to you. Why exactly did you spread such news?

244
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,640
I found Sam Jang, but strange pests keep lingering around her.

245
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,120
So for the sake of protecting my prey, I've turned all their attention toward you.

246
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,730
So you sent the dung flies swarming around your food to me?

247
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,300
As expected, everyone went swarming to you, huh? It must have been annoying.

248
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,190
But is she really still your prey?

249
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,930
From what I hear, you've put on a dog collar and became a dog serving its master.

250
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,970
Thanks to you. I wonder why you bought her this bracelet exactly.

251
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,260
Because you found Sam Jang.

252
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,870
I bought it for her so that you can't eat her.

253
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,390
Oh wow, look at it. It's so dazzling.

254
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,330
How is it wearing the Geumganggo?

255
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,120
It's horrible. I tried to persuade her to take it off but she's too stubborn.

256
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,780
If she still won't later on, I'll have to ask you for a favor.

257
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,110
What?

258
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,920
Please kill her and get rid of her.

259
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,290
I'll ask you at a crucial moment.

260
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,510
And please take this coat for dry cleaning.

261
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,300
It's something I treasure.

262
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,880
Ah, this one as well.

263
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,170
That—

264
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,590
No, with Geumganggo... there should be love.

265
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,120
Hey. Hey. Hey.

266
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,000
Hey, you...

267
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,190
Are you really hoping for me to get rid of Sam Jang?

268
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:10,140
Is this Geumganggo working properly? Is this a fake?

269
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,400
- What is this?
- It's a seasoning I made for when I would catch and eat Sam Jang.

270
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,200
But why... are you crying?

271
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
When I think about how it would have been had I really eaten Sam Jang,

272
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,000
the tears just come by themselves.

273
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,330
Are you that frustrated that you couldn't eat her?

274
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,460
But then again, you did spend three days and nights boiling down this sauce so that you could eat Sam Jang deliciously.

275
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,050
The prey is right in front of you, yet you cannot eat it!

276
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,870
Of course, it must feel unfair.

277
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,400
The sense of loss for the predator who's lost his prey right in front of his eyes—

278
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,670
Ma Wang. Had I eaten her, then she wouldn't be in this world anymore, right?

279
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,340
Just thinking about it makes me feel like my heart is ripping to shreds!

280
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,380
Ah, so... that is why you're crying?

281
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,880
Just imagining it makes my heart hurt so much.

282
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,530
If I were to actually lose her,

283
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,580
it would be so painful.

284
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,750
Hey, hey, if your heart is ripping apart, why are you putting that seasoning away?

285
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,530
Give it so I can throw it away.

286
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,770
Why would you throw it away?

287
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:35,300
A day will come when I can take this damn Geumganggo off and eat Sam Jang deliciously.

288
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,390
And when that day comes... When that day comes!

289
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,300
Oh, it's so sad for me.

290
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,960
Geumganggo has a hold over the heart,

291
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,760
but the devilishness is still alive? Ah, that idiot...

292
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,670
He's prepared so much seasoning!

293
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,830
Wow, how much sauce is he trying to use to stuff his mouth?

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,770
I told you I'd run to you like a dog if you called.

314
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,450
You acted so proud earlier that at this late hour,

315
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,780
I didn't think you would be calling me to bed.

316
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,660
What, what do you mean I called you to bed?

317
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,890
I didn't call you.

318
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,250
Yes, you did.

319
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,290
I didn't think you'd come just because I said your name.

320
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,840
That's not it. I can only come when you desperately think about me and call my name.

321
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,550
You've definitely been thinking about me all along, haven't you?

322
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,040
From now on, I won't.

323
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,100
Unless it's a seriously dangerous situation, I won't call you.

324
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,780
I don't want to bother you or trouble you.

325
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,400
So go back now.

326
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,050
I don't want to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

327
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,700
What are you doing? Stop that.

328
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,210
- What is this?
- Is something there? An evil spirit?

329
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:56,140
It's empty. Do you live your life not eating anything at all?

330
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,890
I eat out. I don't need to fill it up when I'm eating alone here.

331
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,960
As you know, I don't have any family, friends, or lovers.

332
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,170
From now on, you have me though.

333
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,170
When you need me, call. I'll wait for you to call me.

334
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,090
No. I'm only going to call you if I need you to save me from death like we agreed.

335
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,100
Then what do you want me to do? Die because I miss you so much?

336
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,090
Why would you miss me?

337
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,440
Because I love you this annoyingly!

338
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,610
If you don't like it, feel free to take this off.

339
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,270
No.

340
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,930
This is really driving me crazy.

341
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,390
This damn Geumganggo!

342
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,660
I'm annoyed to death, but I miss her already.

343
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,310
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,610
It's Hanbit Real Estate visiting.

345
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,980
You remodeled the whole place, I see.

346
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,920
Wow, it's nice. It looks great.

347
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,950
But is the noise from upstairs so bad that you need to give up this place?

348
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,450
Yes.

349
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,500
I took it upon myself to look into it a bit,

350
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,890
and I was told the upstairs apartment is unoccupied.

351
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:04,610
I hear thump, thump, thump, thump all day from my ceiling, so how can it not be from upstairs?

352
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,220
That's really odd. I was told it was unoccupied.

353
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,170
That's true. There is a sound coming from above.

354
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,310
See?

355
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,820
Wow, the noise is really bad.

356
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,980
They told me it was empty upstairs. Who's up there?

357
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,260
It's not coming from above. It's from this apartment.

358
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,580
This apartment? What's here?

359
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,420
The air in here? Oh, it stopped. How come?

360
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,000
Again! Again!

361
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,270
Lee Han Joo, step outside.

362
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,360
Of course I have to go out.

363
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,740
Son Oh Gong...

364
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,170
You should have called me like that.

365
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,240
Oh, I forgot that you'd come if I called you.

366
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Damn it, too bad. It could have been a great opportunity for you to die without me knowing.

367
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,020
I came since I missed you but lost an opportune moment.

368
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,560
Too bad. I guess you want me to die already.

369
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,690
I've been doing just fine all this time with my umbrella. I won't die from an evil spirit like that.

370
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,000
- Don't get angry. If you do, it hurts me.
- What?

371
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,310
If the person you love gets upset, obviously it hurts you. You can't get angry.

372
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,110
If you're going to get upset, then take this off of me.

373
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,910
I won't get angry, so stop butting in while I'm working

374
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,710
and don't follow me around unnecessarily. Leave.

375
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,060
Leave? Leave?

376
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,750
Seriously, how can you tell me to leave so easily?!

377
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,630
That really hurts.

378
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,440
He really comes to protect me.

379
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,840
Chairman, do you like it?

380
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,660
Yes. I really like it. Good job.

381
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,770
If I knew he was going to get out that easily, I wouldn't have betrayed him like that.

382
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,780
Pal Gye.

383
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,850
Because you have no loyalty to start with, even if you betrayed him, it wouldn't be that upsetting.

384
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,850
If you say that, too, I'll be disappointed.

385
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,130
Since I'm very loyal at least to you.

386
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:51,160
Pal Gye, a pig that's fat out there is fat in here, too.

387
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,700
Secretary Ma, don't you think this color makes me look a bit fat?

388
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
No. You look perfect.

389
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,160
You have a figure that could never be seen on a human.

390
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,030
That's true.

391
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,190
But these foolish human beings think they can become like me if they only make an effort.

392
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,450
And then they totally hurt themselves by going overboard.

393
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,790
Even among celebrities, if they're too perfect, it becomes apparent that they're evil spirits.

394
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,030
People will catch on soon to Hyung Jae Seok, too.
(He's referring to Yoo Jae Seok.)

395
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:24,390
He's okay. He's been going around saying that he's a grasshopper for years, but no one believes him.

396
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,980
Even if he turns into a grasshopper on Infinity Challenge,

397
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,970
people will probably just laugh it off.

398
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,930
- Really?
- Grasshopper!

399
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,290
Then should I try turning into a pig during my concert for fun, too?

400
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,600
If you do that, then in front of that actress you like,

401
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,780
I'll turn you into a real pig, too.

402
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,160
No, it's okay. It's not fun.

403
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,630
But Chairman, where are you going dressed up in new clothes like that?

404
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,620
Are you going to a business lecture of some sort to suck out the life force of some chaebols?

405
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,290
I'm going to wear this to a contract-attached appointment that's more important than that.

406
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,460
- A contract? With whom?
- Sam Jang.

407
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,640
Ma Wang, the thing you put in here is Sam Jang's blood, right?

408
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,320
Can't you give this ring to me?

409
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,130
The smell is nice.

410
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,730
We should've eaten up Sam Jang while we were there that day.

411
00:35:51,390 --> 00:36:00,480
Pig, do not covet that which isn't yours.

412
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,180
CEO, your meal has arrived.

413
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,840
Thank you.

414
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,190
Well then, I'll be heading home to eat. Enjoy your lunch.

415
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,190
You're eating all alone?

416
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,230
You surprised me.

417
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,880
- Are you an outcast from the society?
- No, I'm not.

418
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,340
Oh right, you have to actually have people around you first for them to be able to outcast you.

419
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,100
I didn't call you, you know?

420
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,180
I know.

421
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,970
It's just that even when I crushed a boulder, what bloomed was a flower.

422
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,020
What?

423
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,910
From now on, call me. When you're eating, call me.

424
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,060
I won't leave you alone and stay with you.

425
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,550
You better call me. I'll be waiting for you to call me.

426
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,710
I bet you're going to be super focused on me now since I said I'll be waiting.

427
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,040
Even lifting the spoon will probably remind you of me.

428
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,340
I won't think or call you, so go.

429
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Then let's see each other the next time you have a meal.

430
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,590
It's rice and beans. Enjoy it.
(Standard prison meal)

431
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,910
He can do all kinds of things...

432
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,700
Why are you here again? I didn't call for you.

433
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,810
I didn't come here for no reason.

434
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,790
I came to drop something off while passing by.

435
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,700
- What?
- It seems like you have no intention to invite me, so at least eat with this companion.

436
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,530
- What is that?
- This is Son Yook (six) Gong. (He is Son Oh (five) Gong.)

437
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,530
I'm speechless.

438
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,290
Is it childish? It makes your skin crawl? You can't handle it, right?

439
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,410
Then just take this off.

440
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,220
If you don't, then I'll bring Son Chil Gong and Son Pal Gong, too.
("Chil" is 7 and "Pal" is 8.)

441
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,310
The cheesiness is really driving you crazy, right?

442
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,050
Leave.

443
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,410
So unnecessary...

444
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,060
Well. Let's eat.

445
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,020
♫ My heart beats because of your stare ♫

446
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,520
♫ Because of your gestures ♫

447
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,740
♫ I'm getting tossed and turned ♫

448
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,480
Hey, Yook Gong, why isn't your Hyungnim Oh Gong coming?

449
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,570
I ordered two sets for nothing.

450
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,450
Should I call him? Since throwing it away would be a waste.

451
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,960
Never mind.

452
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,950
♫ To me, you become love ♫

453
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,970
♫ To me, you become my world ♫

454
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:20,920
♫ Now you let me breathe ♫

455
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,790
Wow, this sausage side dish is amazing. Want some?

456
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,260
I don't want to. Why should I? How much will you give me?

457
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,250
Hyungnim.

458
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,520
Thanks.

459
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,970
You always go somewhere during lunch time. Aren't you going today?

460
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,400
I'm not.

461
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,690
That stubborn girl won't call me, so I've decided to be stubborn, too.

462
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,520
Don't you think perhaps by now she's hoping that you'd come by?

463
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,060
There's no way. I'm not going, no. Not anymore.

464
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,760
This is nice and cold and refreshing.

Our Lucifer Entertainment is going to sign an exclusive contract with her.

Of course, I helped you, yes.

A trainee who unfortunately got eliminated in a girl group creation project,

00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,550
Ms. Jeong Se Ra, has now been missing for five days.

The police, having yet to find any leads,

00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,260
have released missing person's flyer including Ms. Jeong's picture and personal information.

Hyungnim, the fact that this girl's corpse disappeared absolutely must be kept secret.

636
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:04,520
On that day, you and I took her deep into the mountains and buried her.

Hello Uncle, Aunt.

640
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,230
You could have just sent the money to my account. Why'd you have to come here in person?

641
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,730
It's the fee for Grandmother's memorial table. I should at least bring it in person.

642
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,060
No matter what, you're not taking one step onto my property.

643
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:33,550
I know, Uncle. For now, here's the money you asked for.

644
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,080
I didn't even touch it.

645
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,490
It didn't get defiled, so you can use it without worrying.

646
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:46,000
Be that as it may, send it directly to the account next time.

647
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,870
Also! This is Grandmother's favorite popcorn. Please make sure to put it on her memorial table for me.

648
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,660
That's nothing for you to concern yourself with.

649
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,760
The salt!

650
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,050
Do you really need to be so fussy about this?

651
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:04,140
Don't you know what kind of child she is?

652
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:08,330
She stole the lives of her own parents and neighbors ever since she was born.

653
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,750
She even ate up the life of my own mother who raised her.

654
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,730
Throw more.

655

Alright, alright.

Unni, my dad threw salt on you again, didn't he?

661
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:06,670
How could he do that when you provide so much financially each year?

I guess. We are your only blood relatives.

Exactly.

Unni, to tell you the truth, I'm going out of my mind.

666
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,190
Why? Is there a problem with the baby?

667
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:33,970
No. My husband used the credit card again.

668

When we're already so tight on money with his birth coming up next month...

Thanks for the food, Unni.

That would be ₩26,000 please.

Okay.

679
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:20,380
I should have asked her to put this on the memorial table for me.

No, Mi Joo.

She said she'll pay for us, right? What a relief.

What's that smell? Were you drinking?

01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,520
My customer poured me a glass. Just one glass.

690
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,700
It went well.

691
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,570
This is great.

- Just hold on. This is...

Stop it. Stop it...

Are you alright?

01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,150

01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,600
What's wrong, Unni Seon Mi?

699
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,860
Don't open the door. She seems to have gone mental.

700
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,420
You said she was strange from the start.

701
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,890
Get out, Mi Joo. Mi Joo!

702
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,820
Get out of there! Out!

703
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,250
She's completely nuts.

704
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,830
Let's just go.

705
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,910
You can't go!

706
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,420
Stop! Get out!

707
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,610
Get out right this second! Get out!

708
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,890
What the heck? How did this happen?

709
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:05,730
Did you do this?!

710
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,380
Are you a total nut job?!

711
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,670
And who are you?

712
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,980
An evil spirit fastened itself to your ill will and carelessness.

713
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:30,360
Because of the evil spirit that you attracted, your child who hasn't been born yet

714
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,260
and an entire family on their way to an amusement park were almost murdered.

715
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,930
First off, I'll do away with that evil spirit.

716
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:02,720
Don't ever drive after stuffing yourself with alcohol again.

717
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:09,270
And if you yell without any manners at that woman again, you will die then.

718
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,860
I called the police; you call the insurance company.

719
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,340
And why didn't you call me? How long do I have to keep showing up on my own?

720
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:25,690
How long do I have to keep showing up on my own?

721
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,740
I'm leaving.

722
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,420
From now on, I'm only going to come when you call. Like the police and the insurance company.

723
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:45,160
Unni! Who's that guy that acts like a gangster? Did you call him here?

724
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah. He came for my sake.

725
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,380
What are you going to do about all this?

726
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,750
He busted someone else's car and hit a perfectly fine person.

727
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,120
Take responsibility.

728
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:58,200
Mi Joo, all this time I've had nobody on my side.

729
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,810
When I was scared, lonely, and even upset, like I am right now, no one was there for me.

730
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,610
So I lived my life putting up with acting like I was fine all the time.

731
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:12,220
But now I have someone to call. It's very reassuring.

732
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,010
So what are you going to do?

733
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:16,480
I am not going to hold back anymore.

734
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,130
You all were the ones who made this mess.

735
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:22,530
I've nothing to take responsibility for so don't call me again.

736
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:30,250
And also, you're a really selfish and shameless brat.

737
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:40,020
So if we were to reorganize our hierarchy,

738
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,530
Sam Jang is below Ma Wang,

739
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,190
and Oh Gong is below Sam Jang.

740
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:50,280
Then that would make Hyungnim Oh Gong below me.

741
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,120
How exactly is the Great Sage is below you?

742
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,940
Oh Gong is below Sam Jang, and my place is right next to Sam Jang.

743
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,250
I'm going to go out with Sam Jang, you see.

744
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,540
Does Sam Jang know that you're going to be going out with her?

745
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,720
Of course she doesn't know that yet.

746
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,860
This little! I thought you were... you were lying!

747
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:13,180
The plan will start in full-swing hereafter.

748
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,530
Have you come after making a decision?

749
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,850
I have something I want to ask.

750
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:23,900
Ask away.

751
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:29,780
You said that you'd become a deity if I used Son Oh Gong to catch evil spirits, correct?

752
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,550
Then if I continue to do such work, can I become what I want as well?

753
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:37,040
- What do you want to become?
- A normal person.

754
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,700
You are Sam Jang. Do you dislike being a special person?

755
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,040
I hate it.

756
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,920
Sam Jang is a human who's been entrusted with a summons for the sake of the human race.

757
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,260
If that summons is finished, then your uniqueness will also come to an end.

758
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,260
Can you find out for me what that summons is?

759
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,290
That's your business, not mine, so figure it out yourself.

760
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,540
I'm busy enough as it is.

761
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,880
So now tell me your decision.

762
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,970
Why are you in such a rush? Is becoming a deity that urgent?

763
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,530
Every day counts for me.

764
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:18,450
I'm in agony for every day I'm made to wait.

765
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:23,660
You must be shouldering the burden of someone waiting for you to come to their rescue.

766
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,670
You really are quite unique. You've got good intuition.

767
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:37,210
You pass.

768
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:41,320
You told me that when I met you for the first time when I was younger.

769
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,530
That's right. This is just like then.

770
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:49,350
All you have to do is be careful of Son Oh Gong.

771
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,640
Back then, you released that brat from his imprisonment in the Five Elements Mountain.

772
01:10:52,640 --> 01:11:04,490
But this time, making the mistake of releasing him from Geumganggo's binding is absolutely not allowed.

773
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,820
Yeah. Let's have Han Byeol practice that one.

774
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,040
Right, right.

775
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,980
No, I'm totally in a loyal servant mode right now.

776
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,460
I'm a total brown-noser, yeah.

777
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:33,380
This brown-noser will be heading home as soon as he delivers a package to his CEO's house.

01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:37,640
Make her practice it! Tingle, tingle~ Love you. Bye.

779
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:46,080
Loyalty. Loyalty. Loyalty.

780
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,890
I wasn't going to do this type of stuff anymore...

781
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:53,270
So tiring. This thing is ridiculously heavy.

782
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,890
It's so hard to make a living.

783
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:18,310
Why did I have to be born as a man?

784
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:59,080
What's in there that is so darn heavy?

785
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,230
There could be perishables inside.

786
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:07,770
Then I'd need to put them in the fridge... Ugh, so bothersome!

787
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,100
I really go above and beyond the call of duty.

788
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,740
I go so far as to take care of all these things for her. Oh my God!

789
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,690
So frustrating!

790
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,520
See, see?! I knew there wouldn't be anything perishable in here. Damn it...

791
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,030
I donated blood yesterday.

792
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:09,730
I'm dizzy. Dizzy.

793
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:27,060
A possessed corpse? This house is infested with all sorts of junk.

794
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,950
It looks like it hasn't been long since she died. She died one hell of a rough death.

795
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,860
[CEO Jin Seon Mi]

796
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:46,820
What the heck? You came here on purpose for Sam Jang?

797
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,500
Son Oh Gong.

798
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,810
She called.

799
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:58,520
Be a good girl now. I've got to go toot my horn about catching you.

800
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:11,800
Why did you call? It doesn't seem like we're in a dangerous situation here.

801
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,820
I want to drink, so stay by my side.

802
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:19,920
You know that I'm banned from drinking yet you dared to call me here to wave it in my face?

803
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,960
You told me not to be alone.

804
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:32,970
Being alone is scary, lonely, and depressing.

805
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:35,990
I called you to be together.

806
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:39,710
I can call you in such times, can't I?

807
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:44,330
Anytime. Because I love you.

808
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,840
I'm getting used to those words now since you keep saying them.

809
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,230
Don't get used to it.

810
01:15:57,230 --> 01:16:01,520
Reject my love and then, for the love of all things good, take this off.

811
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,240
Open this for me.

812
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,530
Anytime. Because I love you.

813
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,360
Why would you bring them as your drinking entertainment? Why are you giving that away?

814
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:41,890
I bought these to put on my Grandmother's memorial table, but I couldn't give them to her.

815
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:45,470
Grandmother... Ah!

816
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,990
You said you and your grandmother lived together, just the two of you, didn't you?

817
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:52,210
I live together with just my grandmother.

818
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:55,240
I'll introduce you to her.

819
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,420
You remember that?

820
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,990
A long time ago, I wanted to bring you to my grandmother, but you ran away.

821
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,800
Those times were good, because I could run away.

822
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,780
Those times were good.

823
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,330
Because my grandmother was next to me then.

824
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:28,220
Say, "Grandmother, please enjoy."

825
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,470
Try it.

826
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:36,380
Grandmother, please enjoy.

827
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,310
Where did it go?

828
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:52,870
To a house in Buamdong with a black front gate and persimmon trees.

829
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,240
My uncle's house?

830
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,290
Did you really send it to my grandmother?

831
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:02,900
Yeah.

832
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,680
What is this?

833
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,730
Why is popcorn—

834
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,690
Honey, Honey, what's going on?

835
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,320
What's wrong with the wall?

836
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,670
What's going on?

837
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,230
Oh, Honey, oh my!

838
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:25,920
Stop it! What's going on!

839
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,290
What's happening?

840
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,500
Why is this happening?!

841
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,920
I sent it all.

842
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:40,970
Thank you.

843
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:44,420
If you're grateful, take it off.

844
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,200
I'm sorry, but now I really can't take it off.

845
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,480
I made a contract with Ma Wang.

846
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,580
I had to pay him back for the Geumganggo.

847
01:18:55,750 --> 01:19:00,300
I need you to uphold the contract.

848
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:16,100
You must be shouldering the burden of someone waiting for you to come to their rescue.

849
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:26,390
I'm sorry, but just a bit... please wait a bit longer.

850
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,530
Just a little bit longer.

851
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,350
So you sold me off to Ma Wang.

852
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,820
He told me that Sam Jang has a summons,

853
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:45,580
and if I complete it, I might be able to become a normal person.

854
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,890
So until that time, please protect me by my side.

855
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:55,280
To be honest, for the past few days, whenever I thought of you coming to my aid,

856
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,950
I wasn't lonely and felt reassured.

857
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:04,120
It felt like having family, a friend, and a lover.

858
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:12,670
In any case, I actually really like that I have you.

859
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,580
I hate to put a damper on those happy feelings of yours,

860
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,110
but us being bound by this is a misfortune.

861
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:24,260
You didn't forget that, did you?

862
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,080
Even right this second, it feels like something very, very unfortunate is about to happen.

863
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,460
It couldn't possibly not be in here, could it?

864
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,360
My contract still hasn't ended yet. Drat.

865
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,600
Where'd it go?

866
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:15,120
Thank God. After drawing blood, I can't seem to focus.

867
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,100
Lee Han Joo is in danger?!

868
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,290
Yep. He's probably going to get torn to shreds.

869
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:24,260
How could you just let that happen?

870
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,820
You need to go and save him!

871
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:30,260
Why should I? Our contract says I only need to protect you.

872
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,140
Whether other humans die or not has nothing to do with me.

873
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,990
I almost lost good money.

874
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:45,100
I almost did.

875
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,620
Why are my shoelaces undone? Is someone longing for me?
(superstition)

876
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:00,530
My little Han Byeol must be thinking of her daddy.

877
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:15,420
Sam Jang, do you want me to save other humans?

878
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:19,260
Sure. I'll do it for you. In exchange...

879
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,270
take this off.

880
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:35,290
♫ The more I try to push you out, the more I think of you ♫

881
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,380
♫ Let me out ♫

882
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,200
♫ Why don't you let me go ♫

883
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,860
♫ You wanna hold me down ♫

884
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,650
♫ Go away, go away ♫

885
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:52,430
♫ I want to get away from you ♫

886
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:56,160
♫ I'm getting closer as though I were drawn ♫

887
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,640
♫ Even while I know it ♫

888
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,160
♫ Woo woo woo woo woo ♫

889
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,970
Sam Jang's tears...

890
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:05,390
- Son Oh Gong.
- Will you be able to bear them?

891
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,190
- Help me.
- Why should I?

892
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:10,560
Son Oh Gong, the Great Sage, the equal of heaven, protect me until the end.

893
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,850
I love you, Jin Seon Mi.

894
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:17,900
At least it will be amusing to watch the monkey flail around from being in love.

895
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,300
What's that?

896
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,490
Will there be an enormous calamity in the human world?

897
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,990
Wake up, Lee Han Joo!

898
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:25,660
As you know, I'm not a nut job that's gently crazy, no?

899
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,300
Great Sage!

900
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,720
♫ I still long for your breath ♫
