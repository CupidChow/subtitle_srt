00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,680
Dad, Mom.

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,430
I'm going on a world tour.

5
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,750
Everything you gave me

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,400
doesn't belong to me.

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,680
I didn't take them away.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Let them return to their rightful owner.

9
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,040
What does Chuchu

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,560
want to do?

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,840
She just left.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,040
What about the plan we set up?

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,830
Lin Dong,

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,510
send a few more people to find her.

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,120
She didn't take any money with her.

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,280
How will she survive?

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,760
Don't worry,

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,670
she won't be in any trouble for a while.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,150
But there's one thing

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,840
you need to know.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,390
She went to see someone before she left.

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,840
- Who?
- Yu Chuxin.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,870
Did Yu Chuxin say something to her

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,280
and she ran away?

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,430
I'm worried

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,430
that she might have said
something to Yu Chuxin.

27
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,120
What should we do then?

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,150
I've sent someone

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,080
to follow Yu Chuxin.

30
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,480
There will be news soon.

31
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,030
(Paternity Test)
Since it's a fact that Zhang Sufang

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,950
is Chuchu's mother,

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,280
and there is also Chuchu's
Paternity Test Authorization,

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,870
this will make Zhang Sufang admit.

35
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,870
This is just an old Scandal.

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,920
It's not enough to shake her foundation.

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,430
Even if we expose this, she still

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
holds the most shares.

39
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,480
In the eyes of those shareholders,

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,080
I still don't carry as much weight.

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,760
The majority still side with her.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,390
Zhou Chuming,

43
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,560
if you, I, and Chuxin's shares
are combined

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,590
can reach half,

45
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,360
what choice would those
shareholders make?

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,670
Where would we get half?

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,430
The equity distribution is very clear.

48
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,510
The three of us together
have forty percent.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,760
That ten percent…

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
You're right.

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Grandfather left a Will.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
That ten percent was left for me.

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,750
I learned about this from

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,790
Mr. Wang, the Zhou family's driver.

55
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,520
Only Zhang Sufang and Mr. Wang

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,600
know this now.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
But they don't know

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,950
where exactly grandfather hid the Will.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
The trust fund won't

60
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,230
return the shares to you without it.

61
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,640
It's pointless.

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
So we need to find it before

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
Zhang Sufang and Lin Dong

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,850
make a move against us.

65
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,160
Based on what Mr. Wang said,
I speculated

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,230
that the Will is likely

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
still hidden somewhere in the Villa.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Chuming, is there any information
about grandfather

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,710
in the Chuming Group major events?

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,830
There is.

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,510
But how does it matter?

72
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,710
Perhaps

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,710
we can use some high-tech tools

74
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,550
to help us.

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
Let's split up and take action.

76
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,830
Zhou Chuming,

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,830
apologize to me for your Dad.

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,440
I'll tell you a special secret.

79
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,710
Zhou Yang, I don't want to
hear your nonsense.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,390
It's about your father's death.

81
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
Aren't you interested?

82
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,270
What do you know? Speak.

83
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,270
- Chuming.
- Chuxin.

84
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,760
None of your business.

85
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,950
This is between him and me.

86
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,400
I never intended for you
to repay your father's debt.

87
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,550
But I think you at least
owe me an apology.

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,760
My parents were at fault,

89
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,100
but they didn't deserve to die.

90
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,920
Your Dad, as his brother,

91
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,760
could have helped them,

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,800
yet he watched them

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,790
walk towards their doom.

94
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,230
As the son of Zhou Zheng,

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,710
the Heir of the Zhou family,

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,560
once believed it was my parents
who caused the family losses,

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
and despised me.

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
You even tried to drive me
out of the house.

99
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,240
May I ask,

100
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,150
what did I do wrong?

101
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,680
Is it so hard for you

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
to apologize?

103
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,550
I'm sorry,

104
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Brother.

105
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,670
Chuxin,

106
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,510
good for your man.

107
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Can you say it now?

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,150
I hope you won't act impulsively

109
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,510
after hearing it.

110
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,640
You must remain calm.

111
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,350
The night your Dad passed away,

112
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Mr. Wang was sent away by Zhang Sufang

113
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
to the hospital to get medicine,

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,030
and wasn't at home.

115
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
But not long before that,

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
Mr. Wang had got
the medicine for your Dad,

117
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,150
which was kept in your Dad's pocket.

118
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,160
I heard that Dad passed away
due to a sudden heart attack.

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,880
He didn't take his medication in time.

120
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,590
If Mr. Wang was right

121
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,200
that the medicine was kept close to him,

122
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,590
how could this have happened?

123
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,440
Was Zhang Sufang at home that day?

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,890
My mom said she was
feeling unwell that day.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,250
After taking a nap, she went to
the study to find my dad.

126
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,390
When she found out
Dad was having an attack,

127
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,080
she called for an ambulance.

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,910
But on the way to the hospital,

129
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,560
he passed away.

130
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,910
This happened a long time ago.

131
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,440
Even if Dad's death was related to her,

132
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,350
it'd be impossible
to leave any evidence.

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,590
Let's put this aside for now.

134
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,870
Once we get the Will

135
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,910
and bring them down,

136
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
we can find out the truth

137
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,350
from Zhang Sufang.

138
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
Now all clues point to the Zhou Family

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Old Residence.

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,910
There's no time to lose, let's go.

141
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,030
The chairman is looking for you.

142
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,870
Please cooperate.

143
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,760
Don't make it hard.

144
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,560
Today's emergency Board
of Directors meeting

145
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,870
is to resolve something

146
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,120
that concerns the Group's fate.

147
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,480
During the time Zhou Chuming

148
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,800
succeeded the Zhou Group,

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,710
not only did he fail to make greater
contributions to the Group,

150
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,040
but he caused scandals

151
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,390
due to conduct issues.

152
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,720
You're likely aware of it.

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
I suppose I don't need to

154
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
introduce them one by one.

155
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,360
A few shareholder representatives

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,200
even made efforts to help
with public relations.

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
The negative public opinion

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
has damaged the Group's image.

159
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,160
But Zhou Chuming and
his wife, Yu Chuxin,

160
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
still didn't restrain themselves.

161
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,470
The Group empowered them

162
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,720
to let them better advance
the first project

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
after the merger of the two companies.

164
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,510
But they put the project on hold,

165
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,200
and eliminated dissidents
within the Group,

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,350
and intervened in
personnel appointments,

167
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,680
causing turmoil

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
and complaints

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
among the Group.

170
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you

171
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
have any objections?

172
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,710
Chairman Zhang,

173
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,270
please continue.

174
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,000
According to the Equity Agreement,

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,070
to any shareholder causing
an impact on the Group's

176
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,440
reputation and Benefit

177
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,470
the board of directors has
the authority to repurchase its shares.

178
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,710
In light of your actions, on behalf of

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,270
the Board of Directors,

180
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,030
I formally issue you a notice.

181
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,950
By tomorrow afternoon,

182
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,910
the Board of Directors will
complete the share buyback from you.

183
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,430
Oh, and Zhou Yang,

184
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,200
effective immediately,

185
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,680
you're relieved of
your position as President.

186
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,560
As for the reason,

187
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,760
