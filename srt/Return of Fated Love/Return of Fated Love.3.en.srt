00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,920
When you spend too much time
with madmen,

4
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,670
you might really become one of them.

5
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,200
Yes,

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
thank you for turning me into a lunatic.

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
It was there.

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
She must have used something.

9
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,600
Ms. Su kept watch outside all night.

10
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,280
And you just went up and saw it too.

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
She slept soundly.

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
How could she come out?

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,430
It can be a nightmare.

14
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,670
She could.

15
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,510
She spent so much time with the lunatic…

16
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,720
Lunatic?

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,120
What lunatic?

18
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,310
Zhou Yang is a lunatic.

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,950
Anyway, you just don't believe me.

20
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,790
She's crazy, but I'm not.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,790
I am jade.

22
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't need to deal with such junk.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
I'll come back
after you've dealt with her.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Chuming.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,630
I thought about it all night.

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't feel right about her amnesia.

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,870
Dr. Liu is good at

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,160
psychology and psychiatry.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
He's served our family
for so many years.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
I think his judgment shouldn't be wrong.

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,320
With my many years of experience,

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,630
I don't think

33
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
it's that simple.

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Don't you feel that she

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
showed up at a good time?

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,270
It's good that she lost her memory.

37
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,550
There are some things
I don't want to bring up again.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,200
Alright, you don't need to
worry about this.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,200
I'll handle it for you.

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Zhou Yang.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,750
I broke my principles

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,110
for you this time.

43
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,470
Mrs. Yu

44
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,760
looks like she has amnesia,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
but actually…

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Fine, I'll say no more.

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,120
Liu,

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,550
if you truly have principles,

49
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,950
why work for the wealthy?

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,200
Why not go to a public hospital

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
and save lives?

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Your words are still so harsh.

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
I can't argue with you.

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,710
Where have you been?

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
You don't look

56
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,710
quite right.

57
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,830
How about this, come with me
for a full body check-up.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
It's not necessary.

59
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,790
I have a lot of things to do.

60
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm leaving.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,600
What do you have to do?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
Are you going or not?

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,760
Come with me.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Say it.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,440
I failed to watch her over

66
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,710
and let her escape.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,760
What else?

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,040
I shouldn't have fallen for her trick

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,550
and was scared out of the Zhou family.

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,760
I told you

71
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,310
to appease Zhou Chuming.

72
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,030
No matter what happens,

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,800
don't upset him.

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,870
You were played by a young girl.

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,590
You should have fought back.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,950
But what about you?

77
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,180
You threw tantrums

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,590
towards Zhou Chuming.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,000
Who taught you this?

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Chuchu.

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,030
You go sign the contract
with Shenghao Group.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,590
Chuxin.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,510
The Doctor asked you to wear

84
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,950
this monitoring bracelet.

85
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,430
If you have any issues,

86
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,670
we can detect them early

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,000
and help you.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
Let me put it on for you.

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,360
Thank you, Mom.

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,440
You're welcome.

91
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,950
By the way, I have a question.

92
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,120
You and Chuming's child
should be due soon, right?

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,200
So

94
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,030
was it a premature birth

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,320
or is it gone?

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
Child?

97
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,640
Did I have a child with Chuming?

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Why don't I remember?

99
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,920
(No signs of a growing belly.)

100
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,910
(Seems like it was gone long ago.)

101
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,190
Mom,

102
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,080
since you said we had a child,

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
how could it be gone?

104
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,350
Let's not think about it if you can't.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
You are young.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,870
There are plenty of opportunities.

107
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,000
The top priority now
is to listen to the doctor

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
and take care of yourself.

109
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh, right.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,310
Remember, don't step out of this door.

111
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,360
If anything happens,

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,710
just call Ms. Su.

113
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,120
Mom, I'll listen to you.

114
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
Good girl.

115
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,240
I'll take you back to your room.

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,030
Are you sure you want to do this?

117
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,600
We need to consider

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,500
all possible scenarios.

119
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,510
Come on.

120
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,100
(beats per minute)

121
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,030
Chairman Zhang, your coffee.

122
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,320
Ms. Su,

123
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,390
I heard your daughter got a full
scholarship for studying abroad.

124
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,230
That's great.

125
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,390
This should ease a lot of your burden.

126
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
No,

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,430
it's self-funded.

128
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,000
(She has the same expression)

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
(as Yu Chuxin.)

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,320
(No issues with expression and actions.)

131
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,640
(The heartbeat is also normal.)

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,710
(Could it be that I'm overthinking?)

133
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,080
Then maybe I was wrong.

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,120
And

135
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,070
the doctor said

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,270
Chuxin should have nourishing soup.

137
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,120
But she's now allergic to
yam after pregnancy.

138
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,070
Be mindful of that.

139
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,910
I'll leave first.

140
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,500
(Lin Rehabilitation Center)

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
Miss Lin.

142
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,790
I was stupid.

143
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,150
I don't know how she managed to run out.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,450
Please forgive me this time.

145
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,200
Wait for my news

146
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,830
and be ready to bring her back.

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
This is your last chance.

148
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,750
If anything goes wrong again,

149
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,120
you might as well die.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,800
Thank you, Miss Lin.

151
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,310
Chuxin,

152
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,630
the proud Miss Lin

153
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,040
was scared out of her wits.

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,320
It must have been quite a sight.

155
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,920
Lin Dong adheres to a wolf-like
education philosophy.

156
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,880
Last night, Lin Qingqing fled in panic.

157
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,470
She wouldn't have an easy time.

158
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,870
You need to be even more careful.

159
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,030
She'll only become more insane.

160
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,550
The tougher she gets,

161
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,280
the more flaws

162
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,110
can be exposed.

163
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,350
I said,

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,360
I want them to witness

165
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,230
how their wealth and status

166
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,830
are shattered into pieces.

167
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,140
Since

168
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,070
she dared to do those things,

169
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,180
she must bear all the consequences

170
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,520
and the most just sanction.

171
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm looking forward to it.

172
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,870
We can now start the next step.

173
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,040
Chuxin.

174
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,120
Chuxin.

175
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,840
I just made yam and pork rib soup.

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,400
It's good for your body.
