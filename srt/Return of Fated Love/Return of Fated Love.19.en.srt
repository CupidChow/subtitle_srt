00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,400
Add another one percent of mine.

4
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,550
Then we can dispose of you at will.

5
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,640
Zhou Chuming.

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,280
Mr. Zhou, Mrs. Yu,

7
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,230
if neither of you have any objections,

8
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,550
then from today onwards,

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,750
the Group will relieve you of your duties.

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,870
The New President will take office soon.

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,960
After you hand it over,

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,400
you can leave the Group.

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,600
Grandfather left me with the share

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,790
so that I can have some money

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,120
and wouldn't be driven away.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,080
I didn't expect it to be so useful.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,510
Zhou Chuming,

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,590
are you also surprised?

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
Zhou Yang,

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,800
let's have a chat.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,200
It feels good.

22
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,400
No wonder someone

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,230
strived to reach this position

24
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,030
regardless of his brother's life.

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,000
Zhou Yang, what do you mean?

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,430
What do I mean?

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,070
Zhou Chuming, do you think this position

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,560
should be yours?

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,120
Don't forget that

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,950
grandfather has more than one son.

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,750
My Dad is also one of the Heirs.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,030
Moreover, he is the eldest son.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,360
He should be more qualified
to inherit than your Dad.

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,390
What happened over a decade ago was secretive.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
Not many people knew about it.

36
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,650
Most of the people involved
have passed away.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,150
We are even less likely to know.

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,120
Secretive?

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,790
If you want to keep it secret,

40
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,000
you must not do it yourself.

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,790
Even as time passes,

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,160
it can't erase what they did
to my parents,

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,040
nor can it cover up the truth.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't know how Lin Qingqing
described it

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,920
in the information she gave you.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,830
But I hope you remain sane

47
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,850
and tell right from wrong.

48
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,520
Don't become a pawn used by others.

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,150
Of course, I won't
completely believe it.

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,830
In order not to let a single enemy go,

51
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,200
I followed the information
and investigated further.

52
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,080
Guess what I found out.

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,110
After Zhang Sufang got married here,

54
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,760
she was not capable of interfering

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,950
with the Group's business.

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,990
All the actions taken
against my parents were

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,710
done by Zhou Zheng,

58
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,480
your father,

59
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,520
my dear Second Uncle.

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
- You!
- Chuming.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,300
Business is like a battlefield.

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,200
It's all about fighting for
power and profit.

63
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,190
I've seen many cases like this.

64
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,990
I understand.

65
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,040
But Zhou Zheng shouldn't
be so despicable,

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,790
slandering my parents,

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,270
forcing them to leave the Group

68
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,160
and give up their inheritance rights.

69
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
He even wanted to send them to prison.

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,430
They were so forced

71
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,590
that they had to abandon me

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,430
and commit suicide.

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
Zhou Chuming.

74
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,600
This is the debt Zhou Zheng owes me.

75
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,760
Since he is gone, father's debt

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
should be repaid by the son.

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,710
I have to collect it from you.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
As for Zhang Sufang,

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,200
since she wasn't involved

80
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,710
and she's your stepmother,

81
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,320
I can let her off the hook.

82
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Zhou Yang,

83
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,510
there will be a fair judgment on that.

84
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,320
It's not for you to judge
whether my Dad is right or wrong.

85
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,150
But since you want to play,

86
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,080
go ahead.

87
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,080
I'll take it on.

88
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Alright,

89
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,200
you said it.

90
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,430
Zhou Zheng schemed

91
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,830
to take over the Group

92
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,390
and pass it on to you.

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Then I'll shatter your dreams

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
and you will get nothing.

95
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,440
No one should think about
taking this position.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
At worst, we'll both be ruined.

97
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,390
Anyway, I have nothing to lose.

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
But you better think it through.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,950
Can you risk everything
to play the game with me?

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,670
Do you dare?

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,760
I just installed a small surveillance.

102
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,600
You must have seen
such tricks before, right?

103
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,760
You told me on the phone
that you had a surprise for me.

104
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,680
It is a surprise.

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,760
But I don't understand
why you want to work with me.

106
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,640
I was immature before.

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,150
And I was resentful of my parents.

108
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,680
I didn't know the whole story.

109
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
So I even held a grudge against you.

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,880
Luckily, I uncovered the truth.

111
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,590
It was done by Zhou Zheng.

112
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,080
It has nothing to do with you.

113
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,080
So, I apologize to you.

114
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,590
As for the cooperation with you,

115
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
I've thought it through carefully.

116
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,560
Tell me, what are your thoughts?

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,040
Madam,

118
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,030
I've been observing you all these years.

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,880
Please don't be upset yet.

120
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,870
Listen to me.

121
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,870
I discovered

122
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,760
something interesting.

123
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
I think

124
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,150
you want to make Zhou Chuming a puppet.

125
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,710
After all, you're still young

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
and have ideals.

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
No need to flatter me.

128
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,080
Just say I'm ambitious.

129
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,200
I guess

130
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,120
you want to use Zhou Chuming

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,910
to completely control Zhou Group

132
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,710
and even turn it into yours

133
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,000
shortly.

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,950
I wonder if my guess is correct.

135
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,950
Grandfather was biased.

136
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
He gave everything to
Zhou Zheng and Zhou Chuming.

137
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,710
I don't want to accept this.

138
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,680
So I've competed with him

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,950
for everything since childhood,

140
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
including Yu Chuxin.

141
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,200
I don't really like her.

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,800
I just didn't want
Zhou Chuming to have her.

143
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
As for working with you,

144
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,590
it's because you can

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,590
make Zhou Chuming lose everything.

146
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
He won't get it,

147
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,880
but neither should you think you will.

148
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,590
I'm a person close to death.

149
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,560
Authority, wealth, love.

150
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,230
Why would I need them?

151
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,950
Although I don't agree with
your assumptions about me,

152
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,000
there is something

153
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,680
we can work together.

154
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,240
Mr. Zhou Chuming and Ms. Yu Chuxin
are temporarily

155
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,160
leaving their positions

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
due to personal reasons.

157
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,760
Effective immediately,

158
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,950
the position of President
will be assumed by Zhou Yang.

159
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,800
The Group will make
an internal announcement shortly.

160
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,350
However, the Board of Directors decided
not to make it public for the time being

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
to avoid speculation.

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,680
In short, I hope everyone will work with

163
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
President Zhou Yang

164
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,880
to achieve new heights of success.

165
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,260
(President Zhou Chuming)

166
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,030
President Zhou.

167
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,710
No.

168
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,000
Not President now.

169
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,150
Let me call you brother.

170
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,590
If you're upset, you can show it.

171
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,590
It can harm your health.

172
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Do you think you can

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,320
to turn things around?

174
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,650
Let me give you some advice.

175
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,590
Don't be naive.

176
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,760
Today it's just your position.

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
Tomorrow, you might not even be able to

178
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,360
keep your shares.

179
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,070
How about

180
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,710
you kneel and call me brother?

181
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,080
I'll leave you 1% of the shares

182
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,950
like grandfather did.

183
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,680
It can cover the rest of your life.

184
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Zhou Yang,

185
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
do you know

186
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,270
you look like a petty person now?

187
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,200
You're upset?

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,150
