=Episode 20=

3
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,920
You're upset?

4
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,870
Bite me.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,440
Come on.

6
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,510
Hit here.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
Chuming.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,640
It's time to go.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,840
Go back

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,800
and take good care of your things.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,750
The game between us has just begun.

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,110
Don't let me down.

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,480
I had long anticipated
this day would come.

14
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,840
I just didn't expect it to come so soon.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,920
Are we leaving with nothing?

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,800
Of course not.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,350
Although we've been
relieved of our positions,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
we still retain the rights
of executive directors.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,520
We only have dividends,

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,950
but can't participate
in the Group's decision-making.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,510
What is the point of this?

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,670
Chuming,

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,870
only by retreating

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,760
can we better save energy

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,510
and prepare for
a stronger strike next time.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,790
Actually, I realized long ago,

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,230
that Mom has always been
raising me as a puppet.

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,000
That's why I chose

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,080
to join Zhou Group as an intern,

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,080
hoping to see the big picture from it.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,670
I want to see to what extent is

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,950
Zhou Group in the charge of Mom.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
(Zhou Group)

34
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,230
(Should it be called Zhang Group now?)

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,030
(Mom,)

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
(even if you made me the chairman,)

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,390
(I can't command your family members.)

38
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,200
(A journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.)

39
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,480
(You taught me that.)

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,270
(I will make good use of it.)

41
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,900
(Talent Introduction Announcement)

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,620
(Zhou Chuming Yu Chuxin)

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,440
Your mentor is Yu Chuxin?

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,760
You're really lucky.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,320
She's much better than my mentor.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,390
What about my mentor?

47
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,800
Before I started my internship

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
at the company, did some research.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,240
Yu Chuxin

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,270
is the famous Silly Big Sister
in Zhou Group.

51
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,150
She's pretty and kind.

52
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,550
She takes special care of newcomers.

53
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,040
She has no flaws

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,870
except that she's a bit laid-back.

55
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,360
She's been unambitious for five years,

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,510
not seeking promotion.

57
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,670
She is the best guide for us newcomers.

58
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,200
Silly Big Sister.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,300
(Yu Chuxin)

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
Zhou Chuming,

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,270
I asked you

62
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,310
if they were calling me

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,440
that behind my back.

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,880
You lied to me and said no.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,830
Now you're confessing the truth.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,430
I haven't held you

67
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,080
accountable for hiding your identity and

68
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,650
tricking me into being your girlfriend.

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,960
Alright,

70
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,550
I admit my fault,

71
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,950
my Mrs. Zhou.

72
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,440
What a pity.

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
If I had been honest with you

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,670
and told you everything,

75
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,450
you probably would have given me
some advice.

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
It wouldn't have come to this.

77
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
Just as I was about to act against

78
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,900
the core members, my mom
took the initiative

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
and forced me to retreat.

80
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,990
Did we retreat?

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,800
Chuming,

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,990
don't forget

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,320
we're not just two people.

84
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Don't you want your box?

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,360
Wait for me.

86
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,270
Chuxin,

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,510
nice wall.

88
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,950
Shut up if you can't say something nice.

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
Chuming, is that

90
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,230
how you talk to your elder brother?

91
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,990
Let's take a step back.

92
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,920
Even if you don't want to
call me brother,

93
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,040
we're at least temporary partners.

94
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,510
Do you have to be so sarcastic?

95
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,390
I see.

96
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,960
Are you still upset about me

97
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,390
pointing out your poor acting skills?

98
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,550
It's the truth.

99
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,040
I told you, your mom...

100
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,750
Zhang Sufang installed a small
surveillance camera in your office.

101
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
If we didn't act well,

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,230
she'll suspect something.

103
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,480
Chuxin showed the pain of

104
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,390
being betrayed by a good friend
and classmate that day.

105
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,910
You're a couple.

106
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
Why is there such a big difference?

107
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,720
Alright,

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,640
didn't you say the Group has big plans?

109
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
What's going on?

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Zhang Sufang is planning to convene

111
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,470
the Board of Directors

112
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,030
and repurchase the shares in your hands

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,560
for major decision-making errors.

114
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,960
She wants to take over
Zhou Group for herself.

115
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,030
There is something I don't understand.

116
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,880
Chuming has treated her as his
biological mother and respected her.

117
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,000
She never thought of handing
Zhou Group over to Chuming.

118
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,200
In other words,

119
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
she intended to take over
Zhou Group from the very beginning.

120
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,270
But she doesn't have a child.

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,900
Even if she obtained the Zhou Group,
what would it matter?

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
Her health is not good either.

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,150
She can't always be busy with the Group.

124
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,850
Who could she give it to in the end?

125
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
Or is it

126
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,510
that she never considered this

127
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,800
and simply enjoys the thrill

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
brought by authority?

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,510
Does she want to leave it
to her maternal family?

130
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,430
This guy has

131
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,000
poor work ability.

132
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,850
But he's good at eating and having fun.

133
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,310
This guy punches in

134
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,320
and then leaves.

135
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
When you call him,

136
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,500
he's either on a business trip
or on his way to meet a client.

137
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,750
And here comes the most outrageous one.

138
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,470
He collects his salary every month,

139
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,200
but we've only seen him
on his first day at the company.

140
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,080
We haven't seen a trace of him since.

141
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,920
I forgot.

142
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Not long ago, Chuxin and I

143
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,680
removed him from the position
of Department Manager.

144
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,470
They are useless fools.

145
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,320
People like Zhang Sufang

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,200
would never hand over
what they painstakingly obtained

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
to that group of good-for-nothings.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
So what is she after?

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,850
She won't give it to her stepson

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,200
and the relatives are useless.

151
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,080
Does she want to emulate Wu Zetian

152
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,080
and return Zhou Group to Chuming after

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
experiencing the taste of authority?

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,710
There must be something
we've overlooked.

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Things are not that simple.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,150
Who will inherit the family business
that was seized?

157
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,320
Child.

158
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
Child.

159
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,320
Child.

160
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,580
(April 2)

161
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,560
Zhou Yang, Chuming,

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,430
give Lin Qingqing and

163
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,310
Chuchu's biological

164
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,680
mother's information to me.

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Now.

166
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,180
(Lin Group)

167
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
Found it.

168
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,630
I have it here too.

169
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,260
(Task Investigation Report)

170
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,620
(People's Hospital Blood Type Report)

171
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,800
Lin Dong has Type A blood.

172
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,590
His wife has Type AB blood.

173
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,960
Lin Qingqing has Type B blood.

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,500
This is not a problem, but look at this.

175
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,270
They can't have a child

176
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,640
who has Type O blood.

177
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,510
What does this imply?

178
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,910
Chuchu isn't Lin Dong's
biological daughter.

179
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,990
Could there be a mix-up at the hospital?

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,200
The most likely possibility

181
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,710
is that Chuchu is Lin Dong's
illegitimate daughter

182
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,080
who was brought back

183
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
and was raised as his wife's child.

184
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
What a dramatic twist.

185
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,080
Maybe things could
get even more dramatic

186
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,200
and might even exceed our expectations.

187
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,440
