=Episode 21=

3
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
If this is true,

4
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,600
it'd be interesting.

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,670
My uncle has been clever all his life.

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,320
I didn't expect him to be fooled by her.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,990
- He lost his business and was betrayed…
- Zhou Yang,

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,240
please show respect to my Dad.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,360
Zhou Chuming,

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,280
although I've uncovered the truth

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,070
that Zhou Zheng forced my parents away

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,520
because of Zhang Sufang

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,880
and his unavoidable concerns,

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,840
it doesn't mean he was blameless.

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,200
I can forgive you, and

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,550
take down Zhang Sufang

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,040
with you.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,120
But I've never forgiven Zhou Zheng.

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,200
If Chuxin didn't say
you could be trusted,

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,840
I wouldn't even look at you.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,510
Same to you.

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,350
Alright, stop. Let's talk business.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,630
Chuxin,

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,920
it was your speculation.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,840
I don't quite believe

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,270
that Mom would be

27
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,350
that kind of person.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
Sherlock Holmes once said,

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,510
eliminate all other factors,

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,590
what remains must be the truth,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,150
no matter how hard to accept.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,230
Next, we need to verify

33
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,870
whether it's

34
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,510
the so-called truth.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,920
Lin Chuchu,

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,230
twenty-one years old,

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,590
whose birthday is in February.

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,560
(Chronicle Example in 1964)

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,790
I remember the Group has kept

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,840
Event Table since its establishment.

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,350
If there is something fishy,

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,760
we may find some clues.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
Found it.

44
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,540
(Chronicle Example in 2001)

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,990
In the second half of 22 years ago,

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Zhang Sufang went abroad

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,750
as the Chairman's Assistant
and returned in April

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,030
of the following year.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,030
Look for Zhou Zheng…

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,950
my Uncle's whereabouts.

51
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,550
During that time, the branch
company had issues.

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,360
My Dad was busy handling it.

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,870
He didn't go abroad

54
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
to visit her.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Chuxin, do you think

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
this could be a coincidence?

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
I think it's almost certain.

58
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,280
She found out she was pregnant

59
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,350
and gave birth to the child

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,400
and returned home after recovery.

61
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,750
She could do it discreetly

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,910
without anyone noticing.

63
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,150
I don't want to think that way.

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,360
But we need to prepare for the worst.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll invite Chuchu out

66
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,030
and try to get her hair.

67
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,990
Chuming, you should

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,470
also look for it.

69
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,750
I'll also look for her hair

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,590
and do a paternity test.

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
Chuchu,

72
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,470
you should learn from
the elders of the Group.

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Can you stop being
so busy playing games?

74
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,870
Chuchu,

75
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,240
your mom is right.

76
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,520
The Zhou and Lin Groups
will depend on you.

77
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,470
We've done everything we should for you.

78
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,590
Grow up.

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Isn't the Group being
managed by Zhou Yang?

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
I think he's outstanding.

81
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,630
That's just your mom's
temporary measure.

82
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,240
Once we get hold of

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,310
his, Zhou Chuming's

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,710
and Yu Chuxin's shares,

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,190
we'll let them go.

86
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,280
Then you'll take the position.

87
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
Chuchu,

88
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Mom didn't

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
take good care of you

90
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,360
nor give you enough love.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I feel guilty.

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,560
So now,

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
I want to give you
the best of everything.

94
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,190
Mom has achieved that.

95
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,840
I just hope you

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,910
won't disappoint me.

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Mom,

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,190
I'm not cut out for business.

99
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,470
It's no problem for me
to control the game character.

100
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,750
But if you want me to
manage a large group,

101
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,310
it'd be difficult for me.

102
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,710
How about this,

103
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,920
you must know many young talents.

104
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,720
You can recruit someone

105
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,360
as a live-in son-in-law.

106
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,240
I won't be picky.

107
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,480
If you're worried that our Group will

108
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
be taken over by him,

109
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,950
I can give you

110
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,950
a smart child

111
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,560
who can be nurtured

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,950
from a young age and then

113
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
take over the company.

114
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,600
Since the child will
be named Lin anyway,

115
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,270
it makes no difference.

116
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,800
Am I right?

117
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,750
I think it's good.

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
This way I can

119
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,040
soon get a grandson.

120
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,150
What?

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,750
Do you want to have grandchildren?

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,430
Why don't you find someone for Chuchu?

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,920
That Cao we mentioned last time is good.

124
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,950
You can meet sometime.

125
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,560
- You're right.
- He's is good.

126
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,680
I'll set you up next Tuesday.

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
This, this.

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,270
Chuming, Mom wants to
talk to you about something.

129
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,680
This is sunscreen.

130
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,120
You must apply it

131
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,100
before military training.

132
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,310
It's easy to get sunburned.

133
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,470
Here you go.

134
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,750
This is moisturizer.

135
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,040
Apply it before going to bed.

136
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,560
- This, this is serum.
- Got it, got it.

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,070
Mom, just give them all to me.

138
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,150
Don't worry about it.

139
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
Look,

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,900
(Sun protection when going out)
It's labeled.

141
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,830
I can read.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
I can understand.

143
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,070
I know you.

144
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,270
You said yes

145
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,750
now.

146
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,950
But as soon as you go back
to school, you'll forget.

147
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,310
I won't.

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,950
How about you don't take
me to school?

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,630
- I can go by myself.
- No way.

150
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,750
I must take you to the school dormitory.

151
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,830
Otherwise, I'd be worried.

152
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,270
Besides,

153
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,920
university students

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,870
are accompanied
by their parents the whole way.

155
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,040
I'll go get the new hat
I bought for you.

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Wait.

157
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,190
Mom, you can't spoil me like this.

158
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Who should I spoil then?

159
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,040
You're my only son.

160
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,750
(I've never disappointed you.)

161
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,510
(I hope this time,)

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,310
(you won't disappoint me either.)

163
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,790
Hello, Chuxin.

164
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,030
You're here.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,390
Isn't Chuming with you?

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,190
He has something to do today.

167
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,500
So it's just the two of us.

168
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
By the way, is there

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
anything you want to eat?

170
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,750
You invited me out.

171
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,190
Why are you making me decide?

172
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,950
Then I'll take you to

173
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,830
a place that Chuming and I often go to.

174
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's go.

175
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,910
Chuxin,

176
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,870
I'm not hungry yet.

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,630
How about we chat for a while?

178
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,800
Your lipstick is smudged.

179
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,100
Let me wipe it for you.

180
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,670
Here.

181
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Chuxin,

182
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
you are smart.

183
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,070
You don't have to do all these.

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
You can just ask me.

185
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,120
I will tell you.

186
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm the illegitimate

187
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,390
daughter of Zhang Sufang and Lin Dong.

188
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,800
You must keep

189
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,920
these things well.

190
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,720
Make sure not to contaminate

191
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
the paternity test samples.

192
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,120
You must be wondering
why I'm being so honest.

193
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,560
Perhaps it's Lin Qingqing's
final madness

194
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
made me realize.

195
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
I've had enough

196
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,670
this kind of life.

197
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I want to end it.

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,800
I knew from a young age

199
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,830
that Lin Qingqing's mom wasn't my mom.

200
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,360
The Aunt who often came to see me,

201
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,390
Zhang Sufang,

202
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,600
is my mom.

203
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
So, when Lin Qingqing

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,030
bullied me since childhood,

205
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,790
I never resisted

206
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,150
because I felt

207
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
that I

208
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,630
took away half of her father's love.

209
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,360
But I didn't want to.

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,320
If it were possible,

211
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,960
I'd even wish that I

212
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,670
had never appeared.

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I just didn't expect

214
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,870
that she would become so terrifying

215
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,120
that she'd harm others

216
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,360
to get what she wanted.

217
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,270
And Dad and Mom.

218
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,750
I find them frightening

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
and filled with the desire to control.

220
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,850
They want to turn me into
someone like them,

221
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,750
full of desire for money and authority.

222
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,910
But when they realized

223
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,630
I couldn't become like them,

224
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,790
they wanted to make me into

225
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,120
a puppet like Chuming

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,000
and give them a grandson

227
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
to continue their wealth and glory.

228
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,790
Is this my value?

229
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,630
Chuxin,

230
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,030
I don't want

231
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,150
that kind of life.

232
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,910
I'm afraid I'll become
the person I hate.

233
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,480
I yearn for freedom.

234
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
This is the shares

235
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,150
of Lin Group they gave me.

236
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,480
I've made a lawyer handle
the proxy agreement.

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,840
These shares

238
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,510
will be entrusted to you and Chuming.

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,850
(Equity Transfer Agreement)

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Chuxin,

241
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
justice will prevail.

242
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,990
Unfortunately,

243
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,360
I don't dare,

244
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,480
nor can I witness their downfall,

245
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
because no matter how bad they are,

246
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,080
they are still my parents.

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,840
Goodbye.
