2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,350
Do you still remember this?

4
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,110
You loser.

5
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,920
How dare you help outsiders
to deal with me?

6
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,670
You want me dead.

7
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,070
But I refuse.

8
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,150
Chuxin,

9
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,480
I'll continue to act by her side

10
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,280
until I'm sure to bring her to justice.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,590
You should also beware of

12
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,840
her acting out of desperation.

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,860
(CEO's Office Mr. Zhou)

14
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,710
Monitor her.

15
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,430
Keep track of her.

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,550
Alright.

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,990
So,

18
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,790
you are also pretending.

19
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,550
Miss Lin,

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,230
our people are ready.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,240
Lin Qingqing,

22
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,870
what kind of place did you arrange?

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,400
It smells terrible.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,230
These are from Dad for you.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,230
Passport, visa, plane ticket.

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,000
And a card that's enough

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,350
to cover the rest of your life.

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,640
He still cares about you.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
But if you ask me,

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
even if you run away,

31
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,430
you'll live a restless life.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,560
It'd be better to

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,960
surrender and get better.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,500
Live well after you come out of jail.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,630
By that time,

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,680
I won't deny you as my sister.

37
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,270
Go get her!

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
What do you want to do?

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Chuchu,

40
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,430
Dad said

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
I didn't know how to share.

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm correcting my mistakes.

43
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,910
I want to take you

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,190
to live a happy life abroad.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
How about it?

46
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,430
Aren't you touched?

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,000
Does this mean I can

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,120
qualify for the Heir of Lin Group?

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,280
What's gotten into you?

50
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,030
Lin Chuchu.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,030
Don't leave yet.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Your good friends

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,400
will be here soon.

54
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,280
Mrs. Yu, you'd better not play tricks.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,870
Since everyone is here,

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,190
let's settle accounts

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,710
one by one.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,800
You ungrateful traitor.

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
If it weren't for me,

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,080
you'd have been kicked out of company.

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,750
I spend money to support you.

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,870
What's wrong with using you
as a punching bag?

63
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,560
You secretly collected evidence

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,590
and teamed up with outsiders to get me.

65
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,590
Don't forget.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
You helped me with these things.

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,870
If I go down, you won't

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,150
get away with it either.

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,190
You stupid woman.

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,630
Was I wrong about it?

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Chuchu.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Chuchu.

73
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,400
I didn't want to do this to you.

74
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,400
But why did you say

75
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,390
Lin Dong

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,360
never considered making me the heir?

77
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,800
Don't say

78
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,190
that I can't share.

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,350
Okay?

80
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,920
As long as you tell me the truth,

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,630
I will let you go.

82
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,000
Then go ask Dad.

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
I don't know.

84
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,350
You're crazy.

85
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,920
Lin Chuchu, I gave you a chance.

86
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,350
You know what?

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,870
I feel disgusted

88
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,950
when I hear you say these.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You won't say it, right?

90
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
Then take these secrets

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
as the Heir in the other world.

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Yu Chuxin,

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,830
before you came,

94
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,430
I thought of many things
I wanted to say to you.

95
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,870
But now seeing you like this,

96
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,190
I'm no longer interested.

97
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,920
You pretend to have amnesia,

98
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,000
and conspire with

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Zhou Chuming to deceive me,

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,120
taking down the people
around me one by one,

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,160
trying to collect evidence
to take revenge on me,

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,070
but what happened?

103
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,000
You're still crawling by my side

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,070
as half a year ago.

105
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,190
You can't beat me.

106
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,560
You will never win.

107
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,150
Lin Qingqing,

108
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,800
do you think you can win?

109
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,070
You plotted to harm me,

110
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,390
try to get Chuming

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,190
and win your father's approval

112
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
and Lin Group.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,960
But what was the result?

114
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm still Chuming's most beloved wife.

115
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,120
And you were abandoned by your father.

116
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,430
He didn't even consider you
as a daughter.

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
You committed numerous crimes.

118
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,000
In the end, you were left with betrayal

119
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,390
from everyone.

120
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,270
That's not true!

121
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,560
No one can take away what belongs to me.

122
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
What is mine, if I can't have it,

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,240
you shouldn't think about it.

124
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,270
It's all your fault.

125
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,500
If it weren't for
you clinging to Chuming,

126
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,600
I wouldn't have done these things,

127
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,430
and things wouldn't have developed
to this point today.

128
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
I don't want this anymore.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,920
It's all your fault.

130
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,830
When I received the call from Tang,

131
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,800
I felt something was off.

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,190
So I was extra cautious.

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,160
As for how the rope broke,

134
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,310
I have to thank you.

135
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,040
I learned quite a lot when you kept me

136
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,680
in the sanatorium.

137
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,030
Get her!

138
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,800
Please let me go.

139
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,870
Help me.

140
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,040
Now I regret it.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
It's too late.

142
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,360
We had called the police
when we arrived.

143
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,970
(Lin, Zheng and others: intentional homicide,)

144
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,380
(intentional injury, illegal detention, etc.)

145
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,700
(They have been taken according to law.)

146
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,160
(Ye gave herself up to the police)

147
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,700
(and confessed to her illegal acts.)

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,070
The doctor said Mom is recovering well.

149
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,190
She will wake up soon.

150
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,480
I believe Dad will be fine too.

151
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,550
The evidence of Lin Qingqing's
crime is conclusive.

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,870
The trial can be held soon.

153
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,190
After Director Zheng learned of this news,

154
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,560
he didn't surrender,

155
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,680
and wanted to flee.

156
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,230
He was also caught.

157
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,270
Finally, we saw the sunlight.

158
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,750
What are your plans next?

159
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,750
Take care of my sister.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,430
Her IQ is that of a few years old.

161
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,750
She doesn't even recognize me.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,070
I still want to cure her.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,270
I believe she'll recover

164
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,480
soon with your help.

165
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
Ye.

166
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,710
Ye.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Ye.

168
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,960
Come and play with me.

169
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,350
Ye.

170
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,630
Come on.

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Ye.

172
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,230
Come on.

173
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,630
Lin Qingqing won't influence you, right?

174
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,200
How can it be?

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,000
I've never used any of

176
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
the Group's resources for her.

177
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,240
I have no idea

178
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
about her actions.

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
No matter what,

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,510
she's your daughter.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Now you're distancing from her.

182
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,630
Aren't you afraid that people will say

183
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,750
you're a cold-blooded father?

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,550
I only have one daughter, Chuchu.

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Wrong.

186
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,240
She's our daughter.
