2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,640
Take a look at this first.

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,600
Do you know what they told me?

5
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

6
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,960
I don't know them.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
I thought they were your people.

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,880
It's just that they have tight lips.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,430
They refuse to reveal
who the mastermind is.

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,950
I guess they're

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,950
afraid of being silenced.

12
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,480
But it's a pity that I couldn't

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,280
find the evidence to nail you.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
But, Lin Qingqing,

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,350
there's plenty of time.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,590
Let's take our time.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
(Assistant's Office)

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,350
Have you found out?

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,790
Yu Chuxin's car

20
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,710
did go to the place
where they were hiding.

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,880
After that,

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
they disappeared.

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,280
They must have fallen
into Yu Chuxin's hands.

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,560
Did Yu Chuxin

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,710
get evidence from them?

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,790
Why did Yu Chuxin hold back

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,760
and not confront me?

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,600
No,

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,480
they wouldn't dare betray me.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,590
They wouldn't dare.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
No, Lin Qingqing.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,950
You can't trust human.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,150
Even if they can hold on now,

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,430
they won't last long.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,900
Sooner or later, they'll betray you.

36
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
Right.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,920
Send someone to find them.

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,240
Send someone.

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,840
What about the people around me?

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,590
Miss Lin.

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,750
Our people

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,280
have been taken down by Yu Chuxin.

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Shut up.

44
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,680
I have plenty of people.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,280
I'll make sure she meets a terrible end.

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,710
I understand.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,470
You want me to help you.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,840
But Qingqing, if you

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,520
had known this would happen,

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,030
why did you hide it from me

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
and do those things in the first place?

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Dad,

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll find them as soon as possible.

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,910
It's just that before this,

55
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm afraid they said things
they shouldn't have.

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,430
Even now, you still hold onto a fluke,

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,190
and want me to
use the power of Lin Group

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,240
to help you escape punishment.

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,710
You are

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,030
just like your Mom.

61
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,470
As long as you set your eyes

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,150
on something, you insist on seizing it.

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,310
If you can't get it,
you resort to extreme measures.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,630
You've never listened to what I've said.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Now that it goes wrong,

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,470
you come to me for help.

67
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,030
I'm telling you,

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,710
I can't help you.

69
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,870
But

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,150
I can point you in the right direction.

71
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,150
At present,

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,750
Zhou Chuming and Yu Chuxin

73
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,870
don't get along.

74
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,430
You can spare no effort to

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,630
bind yourself to Zhou Chuming.

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,000
As long as you turn what you do

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
into something you and
Zhou Chuming do together,

78
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
even if problems arise,

79
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,280
Zhou Group

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,870
can't ignore their president.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,630
They'll come to help you.

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,030
This is called diverting trouble.

83
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,550
Do you understand?

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Understood.

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,310
Then do it.

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
This is your last chance.

87
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,990
Qingqing, I don't know

88
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,430
what kind of charm

89
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,470
Yu Chuxin has cast on my mom.

90
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,590
But she trusts her very much

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
and can't stand others badmouthing her.

92
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,560
So I asked you to join me

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,900
to have a good talk with your mom,

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,000
so that she can see
the true face of Yu Chuxin,

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,190
reclaim the power and drive her out,

96
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
making the Group get back on track.

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,480
I'm worried that the chat

98
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
won't go well.

99
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,070
If you stand by my side in front of Mom

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,070
and oppose her,

101
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,270
it'll upset her.

102
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
After all,

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,870
you're about to become my wife.

104
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,720
I don't want to see any rift
between you and Mom.

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,350
Chuming,

106
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,510
I believe Mom will

107
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,680
make the right decision.

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,950
But I feel happy

109
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,240
that it's very

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
considerate of you.

111
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,800
As long as you're by my side,

112
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't care even if the whole world

113
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,600
doesn't like me.

114
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,480
I know everything you said.

115
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,310
But I don't think

116
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,600
there's anything wrong with Chuxin.

117
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,590
Mom.

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Mrs. Zhang.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,870
We're not saying
she did something wrong.

120
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,430
But we think it's improper.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Yes.

122
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I am the Vice President.

123
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,190
She can act without my consent.

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,950
But she bypassed Chuming, the President

125
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,270
and signed the contract to

126
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,110
carry the project.

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,950
It's out of line.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,350
She wants to have the final say and

129
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,630
turn Chuming into a figurehead.

130
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,470
Alright.

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,630
Don't say anything more.

132
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,430
The Group's Principle
is benefit above all.

133
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,950
She can create value

134
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,790
and bring benefits.

135
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
What's wrong with being decisive?

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,630
I think

137
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,750
it saves a lot of tedious steps

138
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,430
and carries the project.

139
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,920
That's a good thing.

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,310
I think she deserves

141
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,630
everything she has now.

142
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,510
If you feel

143
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,190
that she threatens your position,

144
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,070
you should find a way

145
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,120
to create

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
greater benefit for the Group.

147
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,390
If you can't do that,

148
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,630
then be a mascot.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,190
Isn't that good?

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,400
Chuming, It's okay

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,950
your mom doesn't support you.

152
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,190
I'll always be with you.

153
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
Ye, have you made the appointment?

154
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,110
Yes.

155
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,070
Let's wait for Chuming's good news.

156
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,120
I felt sorry

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,390
for her amnesia.

158
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,070
I kindly took her in
since we were married.

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
I didn't expect her to do this.

160
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Chuming.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
As long as

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,830
you see her true colors and are

163
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,920
no longer deceived by her,

164
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
it's not too late to

165
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
drive her away now.

166
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,910
No, it's not enough.

167
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,310
She insulted me like this,

168
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,830
and dares to covet my Group.

169
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,800
It's too easy for her
to kick her out.

170
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,270
I want her dead.

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,040
Chuming, do you really think so?

172
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,360
She treated me like this.

173
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,830
Why should I show her any mercy?

174
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,680
Chuming,

175
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,000
as long as you make up your mind,

176
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,240
this is easy to handle.

177
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,360
Half a year ago,

178
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,560
I had the chance to make her disappear.

179
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
But I wanted to torment her a bit more.

180
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,630
I did something

181
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,190
with her brakes

182
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,190
and she lost her child.

183
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,240
But I didn't go all out.

184
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
Did you do it yourself?

185
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,310
It's obvious you've
never done such things.

186
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,800
We can hire someone.

187
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,070
Why do we need to do it ourselves?

188
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,240
But I did follow her by car all the way

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
and saw her car accident.

190
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,950
I got out of the car to check.

191
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,950
Then,

192
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,310
I asked Director Zheng

193
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,920
to capture her

194
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
and confine her in the sanatorium.

195
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Qingqing,

196
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,870
the car you drove

197
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,360
wasn't destroyed, right?

198
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,950
I drive it every day.

199
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,910
Why?

200
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,000
The dashcam.

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,830
Aren't you giving others
leverage against you?

202
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,950
Dashcam?

203
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,710
There's no more wine.

204
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
I'll go get some.

205
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
It is time.

206
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,040
Go ahead.

207
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,240
Ye, you're here.
