=Episode 4=

3
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,460
Chuxin,

4
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,200
I just made yam and pork rib soup.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,600
It's good for your body.

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Miss Lin,

7
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,840
she's truly lost her memory.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,430
Wasn't she allergic to yam?

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,600
But she drank

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,310
a whole big bowl of soup

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,590
without any hesitation.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,790
She broke out in a rash
all over her body.

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,070
It was disgusting.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,590
I guess it helps with your anger.

15
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,700
(Miss Lin)

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,790
Miss Lin, you are too kind.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,710
This is what I should do.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,230
I will keep an eye

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,230
on her for you.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,400
Thank you.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
Chuming.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,280
My dad said that we could take it slowly
about our marriage.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,870
Don't feel too pressured.

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,040
No matter what happens,

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,280
it won't affect the merger
of our families.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Haven't you always wanted to
meet with President Jin?

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,870
My dad is familiar with him.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
How about we have a meal together?

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,710
Alright.

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,560
- Chuming.
- Qingqing.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,710
Sorry to your father.

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,560
Maybe some other time.

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,910
Chuming.

34
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,240
Wasn't she lying at home half-dead?

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,960
It's unbelievable.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,020
Sorry,

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,630
the subscriber you dialed
is unavailable.

38
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,400
Please try again later.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Sorry, the subscriber…

40
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,840
How is she?

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,960
Fortunately, Mrs. Yu
vomited some of it out.

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
There's no major issue.

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,310
Pay attention to her diet.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Thank you, Dr. Liu.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,680
You can get busy now.

46
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,620
Alright.

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,550
Chairman Zhang.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Ms. Su,

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,470
you've been working in my family
for so many years.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,000
How could you make such a basic mistake?

51
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,470
I told you many times

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,430
that Chuxin

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,360
is allergic to yam.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
Could it be...

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Forget it.

56
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,470
You can no longer work here.

57
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,400
Pack up your things and leave.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
Chairman Zhang,

59
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,030
please don't make me leave, I...

60
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,870
Mom.

61
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,120
Ms. Su stayed by my side day and night,

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,360
not getting proper rest

63
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,630
for taking care of me.

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,360
She just forgot it.

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,630
So don't blame her.

66
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,710
Please don't drive her away.

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,360
Since Chuxin pleaded for you,

68
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,240
and her body isn't in serious condition,

69
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,520
let's leave it at that for now.

70
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,560
Remember to take good care of Chuxin.

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,590
You may have to leave

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,840
if this happens again.

73
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,470
Ms. Su, thank you.

74
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,120
I love yam soup.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Have some.

76
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,020
Chuxin.

77
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,800
Chuxin, are you okay?

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Chu…

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,430
Why is it so serious?

80
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,360
Will it cause any fatalities?

81
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,240
Call the doctor.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
(Cetirizine Hydrochloride Tablets)

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Chuxin.

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Thank you for pleading for me.

85
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,120
You're quite nice.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Ms. Su.

87
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,480
My kindness

88
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,240
is more than this.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,950
Where did you get the video from?

90
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,030
Give it to me.

91
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,120
The annual study-abroad expenses

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,270
for your daughter are big.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,070
Your husband has been
unemployed for years.

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,890
The salary you earn as a nanny

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,270
can't cover it.

96
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,750
So where did the money come from?

97
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,680
I, I…

98
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,480
I was wrong…

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
I was being stupid.

100
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,480
I took Miss Lin's money
to cause you trouble.

101
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,040
Please spare me.

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,510
I won't dare to do it again.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
You stole the employer's things

104
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,750
and now took money to hurt me.

105
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,430
This is an added crime.

106
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,180
My Mom is kind.

107
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,670
But she is a businesswoman.

108
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,400
She can never tolerate

109
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,000
things like this.

110
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,830
If she finds out about this,

111
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,630
you'll be sent to jail by her.

112
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,430
Chuxin, I was wrong.

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,830
Please forgive me this time.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
You know my family's situation.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Please help me this time.

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,560
I promise to turn over a new leaf.

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,870
I'm not a cruel person.

118
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,350
Since you plead with me so much,

119
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,830
I'll just pretend

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,160
I didn't see it.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,240
Chuxin, from now on,

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,750
I'll listen to you here.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,510
As for Miss Lin…

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,240
No, Lin Qingqing.
I'll never contact her again.

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

126
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,430
You should still

127
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,070
earn her money.

128
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,560
But I only hope that you

129
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,850
take care of me a bit more

130
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,870
at certain times.

131
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,360
I understand.

132
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,120
I know what to do.

133
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,380
(Wonton)

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,300
Here comes the wontons.

135
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,880
- Come on, be careful.
- It's hot.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
Let me do it.

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Why are you standing there?

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Touch your ears.

139
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,190
Behave yourself.

140
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,720
Come on, eat it.

141
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

142
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,530
Yu Chuxin.

143
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,950
Yu Chuxin.
