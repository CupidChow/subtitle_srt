00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,940
=Return of Fated Love=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,300
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,160
Chuming.

4
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,430
Ye,

5
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,350
it's been half a year

6
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,320
since I was confined
in Lin's private sanatorium.

7
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,000
During this time,
my parents have been in a coma.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,150
Zhou Chuming thought
eloped with Zhou Yang,

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,760
so no one would report me missing.

10
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,670
The sanatorium is under
the absolute control of Lin Qingqing.

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,950
Everyone believed her
and Director Zheng's words.

12
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,200
They thought I was
a mentally broken lunatic.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,870
From an outsider's perspective,

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,790
everything happened to me
seemed accidental.

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,640
But I know,

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,310
all of this is related to Lin Qingqing.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,510
But six months have passed.

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,920
Lin Qingqing had enough time

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,310
to erase the clues of
her persecution against me

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,430
during this period.

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,760
So we can't

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,870
report her to the police

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,920
without evidence.

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,120
We'd only alert her.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,120
Even if we uncover some minor details,

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,030
it won't subject her to legal sanction.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,390
So what do you plan to do?

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,150
Lin's company and Zhou's company
are about to merge.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,070
Lin's Company

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,600
is much smaller than Zhou's.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
And Zhou Chuming holds the largest share
of Zhou's company.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,150
He is like the future lion king
in a pride of lions.

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,450
Although he hasn't taken power,

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,510
he's the focal point of
many people's competition.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,640
In this situation,

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,040
Lin Qingqing and Zhang Sufang

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
will naturally get nervous.

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,320
If I join in

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,830
and find reliable partners

40
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,760
to support Zhou Chuming,

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,990
they'll tend to mess things up.

42
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
We can find more clues

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,270
as long as they reveal flaws.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,510
You mean

45
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,830
to cling to Zhou Chuming.

46
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,880
You'll openly compete with them.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,920
But when they are in chaos,

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,950
you'll follow the clues

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,160
and seize their flaws.

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,630
Yes, feint one way

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,640
and attack another.

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,670
I think it's feasible.

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,950
Since

54
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,040
they have schemes against Zhou Chuming,

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,710
I'll return to him

56
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,550
and leverage his influence

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,950
to find a way to deal with them.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Chuxin.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,110
During the five months you were away,

60
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,230
he's been covering your parents'
medical expenses.

61
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,390
And he secretly sent

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,480
quite a few people to find you.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
It seems

64
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,110
that he still cares about you.

65
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,830
Does he truly care about me,

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
or is he just unwilling to
accept my betrayal?

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,790
This still needs to be confirmed.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Chuming,

69
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,550
we recited our vows together

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,040
to share both hardships and joys.

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,200
If we can't stay together until old age,

72
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,230
then…

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Chuming.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Chuming,

75
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,830
I've tried on the wedding dress

76
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,080
and I've also picked out your outfit.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,120
Tomorrow,

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,880
you'll be the most handsome groom
at the wedding.

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,350
(Message alert from Director Zheng)
Miss Lin.

80
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,360
That woman ran away.

81
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,310
It seems someone's dreams
are about to be shattered.

82
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,230
Chuchu,

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,830
I just killed a fish.

84
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,550
Stay for dinner.

85
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,790
Yu Chuxin,

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,710
how dare you come back?

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
You must be Qingqing.

88
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
I heard from Mom

89
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
that you are Chuming's best friend and

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,790
you've been managing
a branch company out of town.

91
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,190
Today, you made a special trip back

92
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,710
to attend my wedding with Chuming.

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Thank you.

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,390
Chuxin, where

95
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,880
have you been for the past six months?

96
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Six months?

97
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,270
I've been working at the company.

98
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
Yu Chuxin, I thought

99
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,440
you eloped with Zhou Yang

100
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,000
after you ran away from home

101
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,590
six months ago.

102
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,080
What are you doing back now?

103
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Run away from home?

104
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,710
How could I possibly run away from home?

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
Zhou Yang?

106
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,710
Zhou Yang?

107
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,120
The patient seems to have suffered

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
a mental stimulation,

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,560
selectively forgetting memories
from the past six months.

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,760
And her mental state
is currently precarious.

111
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,760
She should rest in a good environment.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
She can't suffer any more stress.

113
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,800
Alright, I understand.

114
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,950
I'll leave first.

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,910
Amnesia?

116
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,600
She might be dumped by Zhou Yang

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,640
and was affected.

118
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,030
Then let's find Zhou Yang

119
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,200
and have him take her away.

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Qingqing,

121
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,000
they haven't divorced yet.

122
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,280
How can you have Zhou Yang

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,510
come and take her away?

124
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,240
If she gets affected again,

125
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,760
she'll blame Chuming for it.

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,230
What should we do then?

127
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,720
The court was supposed to
announce the divorce next week.

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,550
But she suddenly showed up now

129
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,650
and claimed she had amnesia.

130
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
Can they really get a divorce?

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,560
How about we lock her up somewhere

132
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,950
and deal with it after the divorce?

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,950
Qingqing, no one knows

134
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,760
how many people saw her return home.

135
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,750
Lock her up?

136
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,590
Where?

137
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,390
What kind of society
do you think this is?

138
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,270
Do you think this would work?

139
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
We'll keep an eye on her

140
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,240
and won't let her leave here.

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,080
We'll discuss it after the divorce.

142
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,800
Ms. Su is on her day off today.

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,150
I'll have her come back now

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,910
and watch her 24 hours a day.

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,240
Madam.

146
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,350
What about Chuming?

147
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,030
I'll talk to him about it.

148
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,510
Chuming.

149
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,030
Chuming.

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
The Doctor said I have amnesia.

151
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,150
But it shouldn't be like this.

152
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,830
We agreed

153
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,390
to protect each other for a lifetime

154
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,240
and wouldn't let each other
suffer sadness.

155
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,910
I believe in myself.

156
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,150
And I believe in you.

157
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,310
So these six months

158
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,160
should be very sweet.

159
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,760
How could I possibly forget?

160
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,560
A lot has happened during this time.

161
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,120
Let's talk after your recovery.

162
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
Get some rest.

163
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,270
Where will you sleep then?

164
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,590
The study room.

165
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
Ms. Su, take care of her.

166
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,150
Troublemaker.

167
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's see how Miss Lin deals with you.

168
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,760
My baby.

169
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,590
Give me back my baby.

170
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,150
My baby.

171
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,560
Give me back my baby.

172
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,320
Yu Chuxin.

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,830
Miss Lin, here is the key.
