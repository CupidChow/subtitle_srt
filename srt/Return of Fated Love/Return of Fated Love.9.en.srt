Then let's get a divorce.

(Zhou Chuming, Yu Chuxin)

6
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,320
You...

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,880
Zhou Yang!

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,510
Did Yu Chuxin really lose her memory?

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,000
What on earth are you guys up to?

10
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,020
(Song Dynasty Space)

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,510
Don't you like Yu Chuxin?

12
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
You did all that only to

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
take her away, didn't you?

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,840
Do you need my help?

15
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,560
- None of your business.
- Fine.

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
Let's talk about something else.

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,510
For the past six months,

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,840
you have been investigating
your parents' death.

19
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,510
Lin Group and Zhou Group
have cooperated for so many years,

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,200
so my dad knows

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
some secrets.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,990
He happened

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,590
to tell me about your parents.

24
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,230
Are you interested?

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560
Chuxin,

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,160
sign this agreement.

27
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,670
From now on,

28
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,230
you'll be a shareholder of Zhou Group.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,240
It's the most important thing

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,390
(Zhou Chuming)
apart from you.

31
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,200
I want to share it with you.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
I've signed it.

33
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,230
Chuming,

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,350
I married you

35
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,440
because of love.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,480
It was my willing choice.

37
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,670
I've never wanted to take

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,390
anything of Zhou Group from you.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,710
But our love is real

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,950
and pure,

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,510
isn't it?

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,950
So, I don't want

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,950
other things to affect our relationship.

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,470
Okay?

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
Mom,

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,280
it's your old disease.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
You must take medicine.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Come on.

49
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,360
Yu Chuxin,

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
just make it clear.

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,710
What exactly do you want?

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,600
I only want to protect myself.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,110
Am I wrong?

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Let me put it another way.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,230
Tell me what you need,

56
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,080
and I'll fulfill it.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,160
But you must return Chuming's shares.

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Okay.

59
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,550
I want to go back to Zhou Group.

60
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,510
Impossible.

61
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,320
You have already caused chaos at home.

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,520
Do you think

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
I'll let you ruin our company?

64
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,040
Without my shares,

65
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,750
Chuming and you can't

66
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,960
hold absolute authority
in the new company

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,390
formed by Zhou Group and Lin Group.

68
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,950
If I talk to Uncle Lin,

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,270
what will happen?

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,110
Will Zhou Group

71
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,950
be controlled by others one day?

72
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,790
You...

73
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
Mom,

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,640
you should think it through.

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
After all,

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,830
we are still family.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
I won't meddle in the relationship

78
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,800
between Chuming and you.

79
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,560
You can go back to the company

80
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,390
as

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,150
Chairman's Assistant.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,350
You have absolute autonomy.

83
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,590
You are only accountable to me.

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you satisfied now?

85
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
Thank you, Mom.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,070
My father founded Zhou Group

87
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,670
and made it thrive step by step.

88
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,240
He handed over his life's work to me.

89
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,920
Zhou Group is mine

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,950
and can only be mine.

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,440
Listen,

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,120
no one can take anything

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,520
from Zhou Group,

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
including you, Yu Chuxin!

95
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,030
Mr. Zhou,

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,510
please watch your language.

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,630
I'm speaking to you as a shareholder

98
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,710
of Zhou Group.

99
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,760
Do you deserve it?

100
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
Chuxin, are you okay?

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
Did you record it?

102
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,030
Send it to Lin Qingqing.

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Yu Chuxin,

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
you can go back to the company,

105
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,760
but I have a request.

106
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,350
Before the consolidation project
is on track,

107
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,270
I don't want to hear any rumors

108
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,080
about our divorce.

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,470
Do you want me to act as a good wife

110
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,470
in the company?

111
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,880
It's just acting.

112
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
I can do it,

113
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,710
but can you?

114
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,240
Let's go,

115
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Mrs. Zhou.

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,680
Mr. Zhou, my appointment

117
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,950
as Vice President

118
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,910
has been announced.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
From now on,

120
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,440
we are colleagues.

121
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,630
Miss Lin, my appointment

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,800
as Chairman's Assistant
has also been announced.

123
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Looking forward to

124
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
working with you.

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,950
Did that nasty woman Yu Chuxin
lose her memory or not?

126
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
If she didn't,

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,150
could she have
started investigating me?

128
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,150
But it seems she really

129
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,950
lost her memory.

130
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,030
No,

131
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,470
we must be cautious.

132
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,160
Six months ago,

133
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,870
I asked you to take care of
her parents for good.

134
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,080
Did you clean it up?

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Okay.

136
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,480
Find a place to hide for a while.

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,330
Do not show up.

138
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,710
I'll transfer the money to you.

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Chuxin,

140
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,270
now that you're Chairman's Assistant,

141
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,480
why are you sitting with us?

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,590
Exactly. Shouldn't you have
your own office?

143
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,190
As long as I can work,

144
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,320
does the seat matter?

145
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,480
I prefer being with you all

146
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,190
than sitting in the office alone.

147
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,030
Chuxin,

148
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,790
you're true
to your original aspirations.

149
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,720
You're rich now, yet

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,030
you're still hard-working and kind.

151
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,940
(Ye: Let's talk.)

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
I'm going to the restroom.

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,950
We'll help you tidy up.

154
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,710
- Thank you.
- Let me do it.

155
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,150
Ye,

156
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,510
why are you here?

157
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,640
Six months ago,

158
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,000
I asked you to take care of
her parents for good.

159
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,590
(Recordings)
Did you clean it up?

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,670
You've alerted them.

161
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,200
They've started to expose themselves.

162
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,750
Why did you come back?

163
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,350
We agreed to fight to the end together.

164
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,870
We had a deal. We must keep the promise.

165
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,310
As for my sister,
I've arranged everything.

166
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,910
Now I can do what needs to be done

167
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,950
without restraints.

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,040
Besides,

169
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,320
I want to apologize for what happened.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
I shouldn't have

171
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,350
forced you to cut ties
with Zhou Chuming.

172
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,800
To be honest,

173
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,400
I really don't want
to drag you into this.

174
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,350
With someone by your side,
you won't feel lonely.

175
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,670
But Ye,

176
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,870
eavesdropping on Lin Qingqing
is illegal.

177
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,920
You shouldn't make mistakes
because of me.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,350
Okay, I'll listen to you

179
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,400
and stop eavesdropping on her.

180
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
We've forced Lin Qingqing

181
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
to walk right into our trap.

182
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,790
Next,

183
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,630
we will face her fierce counterattack.

184
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,630
Remember,

185
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
always be careful.
