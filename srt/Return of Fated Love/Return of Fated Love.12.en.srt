2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,700
Okay.

4
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Got it.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,390
What did Miss Lin say?

6
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,670
When will she send us abroad?

7
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,920
After she finishes her work.

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,520
She promised to send us abroad

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,790
once we completed our job.

10
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,200
We've done it for her,

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,360
but she suddenly changed.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,990
She doesn't want to talk.

13
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,440
Do you think it's because
we asked for too much,

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,640
and she wants to abandon us?

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
She wouldn't dare!

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,680
Why should we do whatever she says?

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,870
She told us to hide,
and we didn't even go home.

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,110
Alright.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,510
Listen, babe,

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
we did so much dirty work for her.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280
If any of them are exposed,

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,310
she'll go to jail.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,480
Why can't we ask for hush money?

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Don't worry.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
The address is correct.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
It's them.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,480
We can start the operation.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,780
(Inpatient Department)

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,800
Doctor,

30
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,000
how is my mom?

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,430
Your mom is recovering well.

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,790
She'll wake up in a few days.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
What about my dad?

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,150
Your father still needs
further observation and treatment.

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,430
After all, he held your mom in his arms

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,430
and took most of the damage
of the explosion and fire.

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,080
His injuries are more severe.

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,990
Thank you.

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,550
Mom.

40
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,360
Dad and you must wake up.

41
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,600
I really miss you.

42
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,480
I really want to go home.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
Chuming,

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,840
Yu Chuxin begged me

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
to let her go back to the company.

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,510
Now she's caused such a big trouble.

47
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,390
Shouldn't she give me an explanation?

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,470
Mom.

49
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,440
Chuxin said she'd find a way
to solve this.

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,630
Solve this?

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,080
How will she solve it?

52
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,670
Can she solve it?

53
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,230
Chuming, listen to me.

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,880
Use this opportunity

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
to take the shares back

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,390
and divorce her.

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,440
After all, everyone thinks
you are the victim.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,920
They are very sympathetic to you.

59
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,710
Even if you kick her out,

60
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,320
it'll be completely reasonable.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,230
As for the infamy,

62
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,640
let her bear it.

63
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,630
Mom,

64
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,990
we are not sure if the assistant's words

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
are true or not.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360
How can we do this to...?

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Chuming,

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,760
why don't you understand?

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,990
Whether you like Qingqing or not,

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,990
she's the best choice
for your future wife.

71
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,320
Your father was willing to
risk his life for Zhou Group.

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,510
Why can't you sacrifice your marriage

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,200
for the future of the company?

74
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,510
You won't let us down, right?

75
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,670
Mom.

76
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,600
Let me think about it.

77
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,070
Chuming,

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
remember,

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,950
opportunities don't wait for anyone.

80
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,320
Once we are abroad,

81
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
we'll settle down here, okay?

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Sure, babe.

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,160
I'll listen to you.

84
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,680
Once we are settled,

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
we'll bring our parents over

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,190
and let them enjoy

87
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,280
their later years.

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Okay.

89
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,390
You're so filial.

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,160
Considering what you did
to others' parents,

91
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,920
I thought you didn't have parents.

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,230
Well,

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,200
did you forget me?

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
It's you.

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,790
Who are you?

96
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,920
I don't know you. Go away.

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,760
Then let's get to know each other.

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,070
Six months ago,
you took Lin Qingqing's money.

99
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,190
You went to the restaurant,

100
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,720
forged evidence, and recorded a video.

101
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,470
You spread rumors about food safety

102
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,390
and asked your fans

103
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,200
to insult my parents.

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,590
Afterwards, my parents had an accident.

105
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,430
Was that explosion really an accident?

106
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,800
Were you involved in it?

107
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,800
I still have my doubts.

108
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,440
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
I don't understand.

110
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,830
Go away.

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,640
After that, I wanted to talk to you

112
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
and let you clarify the rumors

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
to clear my parents' name.

114
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,120
Yet you set me up
and slander me for infidelity.

115
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,920
Lin Qingqing paid you

116
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
to do this, right?

117
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,670
Then you disguised

118
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,590
as a former employee
to leak information,

119
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,040
claiming I deliberately
approached and seduced Zhou Chuming,

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,830
who went to the company as an intern.

121
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,830
Sun Li,

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Tong Tong.

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,430
You've set me up three times.

124
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm still willing to talk to you

125
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,230
because I want to give you a chance.

126
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,270
So, tell me about it.

127
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,590
How did Lin Qingqing
instruct you to do these things?

128
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,600
You... Listen,

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't know you.

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
I've never even heard of Lin Qingqing.

131
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,510
Leave now,
or don't blame me for being rude.

132
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,830
I forgot.

133
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,120
You need to charge money.

134
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,150
No matter how much Lin Qingqing pays,

135
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,200
I'll pay double.

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,000
Can you tell me now?

137
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,800
Take your money and get lost.

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
What are you doing?

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,230
If I send this photo to Lin Qingqing,

140
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,200
what will she think?

141
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,390
Will she think you betrayed her?

142
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,400
There's always a mastermind.

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,950
I only want to deal with Lin Qingqing.

144
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,120
As for you,

145
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,550
if you tell me the truth,

146
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,640
I'll forgive you.

147
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,150
Think it through

148
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
and contact me.

149
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Contact

150
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Lin Qingqing now.

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay.

152
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,950
Didn't I tell you I had work to do?

153
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,080
Okay, just stay there.

154
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,590
Someone will pick you up.

155
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Dad,

156
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,630
her shares will be

157
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,950
purchased soon.

158
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,310
Do you think we should work with

159
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,800
a Zhou Group's shareholder

160
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,630
to get the shares?

161
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,590
Company shares are the most
important things to Zhang Sufang.

162
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,880
How could she tolerate any interference?

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,390
Moreover, all the shareholders

164
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,240
have some sort of connection with her.

165
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,480
No matter who you approach,

166
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,870
if she finds out in the end

167
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,870
and gets upset,

168
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,000
it'll be of no benefit to Lin Group.

169
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,590
It'll be in vain.

170
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Dad,

171
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
this opportunity is rare.

172
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,950
We can give it a try.

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
What if...?

174
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,830
Didn't you hear me?

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
(Message, Miss Tang)
Take care of them.

176
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,240
We'll wait until tomorrow morning.

177
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,390
If Lin Qingqing doesn't pay

178
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,310
and send us abroad,

179
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,880
we'll work with Yu Chuxin.

180
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,760
No. Do you really think
she will go easy on us?

181
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,030
Babe,

182
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,310
I was just joking.

183
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,200
Don't get excited.

184
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,350
Well, I'll get some fresh air.

185
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,950
Pack our things.

186
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,200
Only a fool will reject money.

187
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,680
Just make up a story.

188
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,710
After all, she doesn't know what...

189
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Babe!

190
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
Babe!

191
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,270
Sun Li, where are you?

192
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,960
Help! Help!

193
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,120
Save your strength.

194
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,350
You know how remote

195
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,800
(Unknown Number)
this place is.

196
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,240
Who are you?

197
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,680
Who am I?

198
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,350
You should know, right?

199
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,640
Lin Qingqing.

200
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,470
You work for Lin Qingqing!

201
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,950
Miss Lin despises
greedy people the most.

202
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,750
Now you're asking for so much
from Miss Lin,

203
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,430
so you can also be
bought off by Yu Chuxin

204
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,640
and betray Miss Lin.

205
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
I didn't!

206
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,720
It's better

207
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,510
to nip it in the bud.

208
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,280
Since you've done so much for Miss Lin,

209
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,830
she can give you an opportunity.

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,560
A ticket to go abroad.

211
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,120
The smart one can live,

212
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,390
while the other

213
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
will have to shut up forever.

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,830
Dear Celebrity,

215
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,830
your boyfriend has made his decision.

216
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,880
Sun Li, what are you waiting for?

217
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Take action.

218
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,350
Sun Li!

219
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,550
Are you crazy?

220
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,190
She's alone! What are you afraid of?

221
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,590
Let me go! We'll leave together!

222
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,830
Sun Li!

223
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,040
You nasty man!

224
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,550
You're always gambling.

225
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,440
I took her money to harm others

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,800
only to pay off your debts!

227
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,670
And now you want to kill me!

228
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,950
Are you even human?

229
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
Babe,

230
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,030
did you forget it?

231
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,120
It was you who turned on the gas,

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
which caused the explosion.

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
If the owner and his wife

234
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,160
had died in the restaurant,

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,470
you would be an accomplice
of Lin Qingqing!

236
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,040
As for the other two things,

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
you did them too.

238
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,040
I was just following your lead.

239
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,160
She wouldn't even have mercy on me.

240
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,320
How could she possibly let you go?

241
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,880
I knew

242
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,750
it wasn't an accident.
