00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,940
=Return of Fated Love=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,750
- Lin Chuchu,
- Why you glare at me?

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,400
This is from Dad.

5
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,510
He wants you to be sober

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,920
and stop disgracing our family

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,030
at any occasion.

8
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,870
Also,

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Dad said

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,590
that you should act as
Vice President from now on

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,230
and focus on the merger and restructuring
of we two companies.

12
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,230
You don't need to be involved
in the business anymore.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,400
By the way,

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,840
I heard that the rest center
under your charge

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,710
is quite dirty.

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,630
Although I don't approve of
some of your actions,

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,230
for the sake of our
sibling relationship,

18
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,840
I advise you to stop and turn back

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,030
before it's too late.

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,230
Miss. Lin, everything is ready.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,990
Auntie, rest assured.

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,310
I've arranged everything
this time.

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
Sister-in-law.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm really grateful for that slap
you gave me yesterday.

25
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,200
Otherwise, I don't know

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,890
how much trouble I would cause
for the Zhou family.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,920
The more I thought about it,

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,280
the more I think I should
thank you properly.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,310
I heard that you're not
in good mental shape.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,590
Didn't you lose your memory?

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,400
So I've invited the most authoritative

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,500
psychologists and psychiatrists here

33
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,550
to take a good look at you.

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,480
No need.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,880
Chuming has had experts
to check me over.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Sister-in-law.

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,470
Seeing more doctors

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,630
is just to find a treatment

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,670
more quickly.

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,880
Don't refuse it.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,990
Let them check you over.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
Qingqing.

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,720
Since the experts are already here,

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,110
just let them check you over.

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,390
Miss. Lin,

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,990
the equipment is ready.

47
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,630
Mrs. Yu,

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,790
this way, please.

49
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Mrs. Yu,

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,830
let's get started.

51
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,390
Qingqing.

52
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,920
At the banquet, Chuxin really
confessed to you

53
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,710
that she pretends to have amnesia?

54
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,990
Auntie, how could I deceive you
about something like this?

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,390
It's absolutely true.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,550
She said it herself.

57
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,510
Qingqing.

58
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,710
You must have been drunk

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,550
and heard it wrong.

60
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,960
When Dr. Liu examined Chuxin,

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,230
you were also there.

62
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,560
Based on Dr. Liu's professionalism,

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,350
Chuxin can't deceive him.

64
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,200
Chuming.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,630
Do you remember Zhou Yang

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,110
who we saw at the company
that day?

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,110
I thought it strange
after we came back,

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,230
so I had someone look into it.

69
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,120
Sure enough, I found something

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
very interesting.

71
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,790
Zhou Yang did come back,

72
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,550
but he met with Dr. Liu in private.

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,320
There's another thing
out of your expectation.

74
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,390
They two

75
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,160
are actually high school classmates.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,710
Auntie, you are well-informed.

77
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,710
Is this a possible case

78
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,790
that they colluded

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
to help Yu Chuxin fake her amnesia

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
and deceive you and Chuming,

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,790
just to get back into the Zhou family

82
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,510
and achieve some ulterior purposes?

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,560
Qingqing.

84
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,230
I know that since Chuxin came back,

85
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,640
we can't get married

86
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,270
and you've been upset with her.

87
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
But you can't talk nonsense here.

88
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Chuming.

89
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,830
Everything I've done

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
is just to make sure you and Auntie

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,030
aren't deceived by that woman.

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,150
Also,

93
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,120
that guy with the surname Liu
can't be trusted.

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,430
The experts I've invited

95
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,350
are from our Lin Rehabilitation Center.

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,030
They are surely authoritative
and impartial.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
If it's confirmed

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
that she's faking her amnesia,

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,950
I hope you won't be partial
toward her.

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,120
Chuming.

101
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,040
After all, someone who can do
such a thing

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,390
must be mentally unstable.

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,480
When the result comes out,

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,320
just let Director Zheng take her back
for treatment.

105
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
Mrs. Zhang, Mr. Zhou.

106
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Miss. Lin.

107
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,200
After our diagnosis,

108
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,190
Mrs. Yu

109
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
has lost her memory.

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,950
Are you satisfied now?

111
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,830
Let's go back and rest.

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,390
(Qingqing.)

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,910
(The result disappointed you, right?)

114
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,300
(Lin Rehabilitation Center)

115
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,070
Miss. Lin.

116
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
We've checked everywhere,
but he's gone.

117
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,200
He has escaped?

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,830
Does he really think
he can escape?

119
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,430
What about his family?

120
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
They've emigrated.

121
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,600
You once personally sent them away

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
in order to let him focus on his work.

123
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,120
You don't need to remind me.

124
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,350
Go and find him.

125
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,440
Spare no expense to bring him back.

126
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,910
I want to see

127
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,470
what kind of benefits that Yu Chuxin
has given him

128
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,350
so that he dares to risk his life

129
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,590
and betray me.

130
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,270
Yu Chuxin.

131
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,350
Director Zheng praised your
superb acting.

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,080
If he hadn't known
you were pretending,

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,150
he would believe that you had lost
your memory due to torture.

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,120
In any case, without your control
over Director Zheng,

135
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,030
even if I really lost my memory,

136
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,880
he would say I was
pretending, right?

137
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,270
Anyway,

138
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,440
thank you.

139
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
When you found me and asked me

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,990
to help you escape from
that Rehabilitation Center,

141
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,830
I told you

142
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,710
that Lin Qingqing's personal actions
can't represent the Lin family.

143
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,690
Sooner or later, her actions
will lead to trouble.

144
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,590
I helped you just to protect
the integrity of the Lin family.

145
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,390
There's no need to say thanks.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,230
In that case,

147
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,880
let Director Zheng confess his crime

148
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,390
and everything Lin Qingqing has done.

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,880
Director Zheng disappeared
after leaving the Zhou family.

150
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,240
I can't find him, either.

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
But don't worry.

152
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,710
My dad may be able to find him.

153
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,520
With all the malicious things he's done,

154
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,390
he won't end up well.

155
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,510
By the way,

156
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,950
there are still some people

157
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,640
who suffer in that
Rehabilitation Center like me.

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,080
It should also disappear.

159
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,470
You're right.

160
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,270
Although that Rehabilitation Center

161
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,710
can brings a lot of profits every year,

162
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,120
it has been dirty
due to Lin Qingqing.

163
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,350
It deserves to be shut down.

164
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,880
Wait for my message.

165
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,950
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,710
That's my sister.

167
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,350
It's okay.

168
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,830
I understand her conditions.

169
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,000
She's not sick.

170
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,750
She's a cheerful and positive girl

171
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,560
who tries her best to support and encourage
her younger sister's study.

172
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,920
But when the younger sister
started to work

173
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,750
and she was ready to marry her boyfriend,

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,080
can she suddenly have
mental breakdown?

175
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,880
Her real life was just beginning.

176
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,270
Yu Chuxin,

177
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,200
you are the wife of Zhou Chuming,
the president of Zhou Group.

178
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,030
Let those high-and-mighty
big shots

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,270
feel the burning flames of weeds.

180
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,560
Have Lin Qingqing's people found you?

181
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,030
They've been following me
all the time.

182
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,320
Contact Chuxin.

183
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,680
Let's get started.
