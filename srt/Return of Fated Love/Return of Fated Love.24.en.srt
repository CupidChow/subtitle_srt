00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,920
Zhou Zheng wasn't killed by me,

4
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,640
but I was responsible.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,720
After having a big argument with him,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,720
I locked myself in the room
and practiced the piano.

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,080
After I felt better,

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,750
I remembered that his
heart medication was with me,

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,110
but it was too late.

10
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,390
When I went out,

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,110
he had collapsed in the living room.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,920
Chuming,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,760
I wanted to be your Mom.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,080
What a pity.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,560
You are not my son.

16
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,000
I will go to surrender.

17
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,790
You are still

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,670
planning to surrender?

19
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,390
Lin Dong,

20
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,720
I think we made mistakes.

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,080
We calculated every move

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,360
and hurt so many people

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,430
to leave the best for Chuchu.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,030
But in the end,

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,030
she doesn't need it.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,280
She has her life and pursuits.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,560
Dear,

28
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,480
these are temporary setbacks.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,760
Lin Group is still in my hands.

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,600
As long as we join forces,

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,550
we'll take back

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,320
Zhou Group.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
But what good will it do?

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,790
I am a mother who has lost everything.

35
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,640
Could Zhou Group

36
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,360
bring my two children back to my side,

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
and have them call me Mom again?

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,990
Lin Dong, give up.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,510
I know you're unwilling to accept this,

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,360
but we can't have
what doesn't belong to us.

41
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,670
We can't make more mistakes

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
due to our greed.

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,640
Sufang,

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,510
I led to the death of
Zhou Yang's parents.

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,760
So if you surrender,

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
you will confess this.

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
I'd suffer more than just going to jail.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,870
I'd have to pay with my life.

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,190
Are you so heartless?

50
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,750
We should

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,990
take the responsibility.

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,230
Lin Dong,

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,640
don't worry.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,710
The death of Zhou Yang's parents

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,550
was related to your trap,

56
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,640
they also made mistakes.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,270
If they hadn't been so greedy,

58
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,110
they wouldn't have ended up
in a dead end.

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,760
As long as you surrender with me

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
and explain everything,

61
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,110
you don't have to pay with your life.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,950
I'm not afraid of taking responsibility.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,200
I can go with you to surrender.

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,390
But Sufang,

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,830
let's wait a few more days.

66
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,430
Let me find Chuchu first.

67
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,270
Okay?

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,550
After all,

69
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,990
everything I've done

70
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,830
is for Chuchu.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,590
Before we surrender,

72
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,270
we should at least see her, right?

73
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Isn't this what you hoped for?

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,790
Dear Fang,

75
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,830
don't blame me.

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Blame yourself

77
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,110
for insisting on surrendering.

78
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,150
Since you chose to bear it alone,

79
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,710
I chose this way for you.

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,830
Rest assured.

81
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,240
Since I found out

82
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,910
Zhou Yang and Yu Chuxin

83
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,200
had contact,

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,240
I've been preparing for this day.

85
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,270
I had someone imitate your handwriting

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,000
and wrote this suicide note.

87
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,440
Your Zhou Group

88
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,640
was taken away,

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,910
and you had an affair
during the marriage.

90
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,800
So

91
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,910
you're overwhelmed with shame

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,830
and chose to commit suicide.

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,350
Doesn't this arrangement
seem reasonable?

94
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,120
Rest assured.

95
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,800
No one will suspect
that your suicide is related to me.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,270
Farewell, my dear.

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Yu Chuxin?

98
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,960
I have recorded

99
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,270
everything you just did.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,150
Save your words

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,150
to the police.

102
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,200
- Zhou Yang.
- Zhou Yang.

103
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,140
(Inpatient Department)

104
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,640
Dad, do you know?

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
The bad guys have been caught.

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,120
We're waiting for the court trial.

107
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,590
Unexpected, right?

108
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,120
Your Chuxin

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
actually did such a big thing.

110
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,390
You must be very proud of me.

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,470
Mom has woken up.

112
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,630
Dad,

113
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,640
you should wake up soon too.

114
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,510
Old man,

115
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,950
wake up.

116
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,910
Cook Chuxin

117
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,910
favorite big pork knuckle.

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,000
Brother,

119
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,640
does it take that long
to peel an orange?

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,440
Are you feeling better?

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,910
Chuxin,

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
I've wanted to tell you something.

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,030
I've liked you

124
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,350
since I started university.

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
Thank you.

126
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,910
Take a rest.

127
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,880
I'll come tomorrow.

128
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,350
Why?

129
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,650
Is the Group out of things to do?

130
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,030
Go on with your work.

131
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,470
- Bye.
- Bye.

132
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,760
You must be happy.

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Chuming,

134
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,910
what did the doctor say?

135
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,120
The doctor said he has
at most five days left.

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,120
Let's stay

137
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,800
with him.

138
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't let him be alone.

139
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,820
(Xianshu)

140
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,380
(One year later)

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Chuxin,

142
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,750
what are you thinking about?

143
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm thinking

144
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,030
that all of this feels like a dream.

145
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,710
There are nightmares

146
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,710
and sweet dreams.

147
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,990
But fortunately,

148
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,470
you are by my side.

149
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,280
Thank you, Chuming.

150
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

151
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,800
Alrigt.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,470
Yesterday, I took the baby to see Mom.

153
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,400
Mom asked

154
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,710
asked why you didn't come.

155
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,350
She wondered if you still resent her.

156
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,080
I explained for you for quite a while.

157
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,080
So I feel that

158
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,560
Mom cares about you.

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,440
Mom also said that
after the baby is born,

160
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,680
we should send her some photos.

161
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,680
She also wants to
watch the baby grow up.

162
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
Okay.

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,280
Chuming,

164
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,430
Chuxin,

165
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,280
the driver is ready.

166
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,440
It's time to go.

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Let's go.

168
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,720
Let's go.

169
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,750
- We're…
- Let's go.

170
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,280
taking you to see Uncle.
