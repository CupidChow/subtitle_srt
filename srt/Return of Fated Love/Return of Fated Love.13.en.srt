2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,450
Lin Qingqing secretly started
many MCN companies

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,750
with her private savings.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,100
I'm a contracted internet celebrity
of this company.

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,790
My boyfriend Sun Li

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,470
is my agent.

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,470
Lin Qingqing said as long as
I handle this matter well,

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,150
she'll give us a large sum of money

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,320
to send us abroad.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Believe me.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,520
These were conspired by Sun Li

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,790
and Lin Qingqing.

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,000
I was forced.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,920
No, no.

16
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,860
Crazy woman.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,800
Why didn't you say this
when you spent the money?

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,400
Listen to me.

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,430
Listen to me.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
In a situation where two prisoners
can't talk directly,

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,840
who have to make independent decisions,

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,150
they'll choose betrayal
for the greatest Benefit.

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,790
This is the so-called
prisoner's dilemma.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
Sun Li,

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,950
Tongtong has chosen to confess.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
What about you?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
It's okay if you don't work with me,

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,760
but we have this.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
Your value has significantly decreased.

30
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,640
Prepare to face Lin Qingqing's
fierce retaliation.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,430
Wait, wait.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,600
Ms. Yu.

33
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,580
Ms. Yu.

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,680
I can surrender as long as

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,950
you protect me.

36
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,280
I can be a witness.

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,560
It was forced by Lin Qingqing.

38
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,070
Surrender?

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,400
Now is not the time.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,040
But before you surrender,

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,230
I can ensure your safety.

42
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,550
Thank you.

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

44
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,870
Thank you.

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,960
Save it

47
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,590
for the trial.

48
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,430
Chairman Zhu,

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,120
do you have no thoughts about

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,520
Yu Chuxin's shares?

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,960
You mean

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,630
no matter which shareholder
buys the shares,

53
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,000
they'll return them to Mrs. Sufang?

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,470
Right, I just wanted to confirm.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,240
After all, Mrs. Sufang and I are family.

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,360
Alright, you go ahead and stay busy.

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,900
Let's dine together sometime.

58
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,590
Zhang Sufang

59
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,080
always appears to be a nice person.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,700
I didn't expect she'd have such control
over the Board of Directors.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,750
It seems no one dares to
go against your wishes.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
But that's okay.

63
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,910
This time,

64
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll kick Yu Chuxin out first.

65
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,870
As for the Zhou Group…

66
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,560
Zhang Sufang, do you think
you can outlive me?

67
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,560
Miss Lin, I went to
the address you provided

68
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,870
to find Sun Li and Tongtong

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
but failed.

70
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,870
Their phone is off.

71
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Can't get in touch.

72
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,550
They're missing?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Don't they want the money

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
to go abroad anymore?

75
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,520
Do they want to raise the price again?

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,470
Greedy little men.

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
I am Tongtong.

78
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,680
I am Tongtong's agent, Sun Li.

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,000
Thinking about all the
wrong things we've done,

80
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,840
we felt uneasy these past few days.

81
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,560
In order not to make repeated mistakes,

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,710
we've decided to confess on the internet

83
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,870
and apologize to Yu Chuxin
and her parents.

84
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,310
We are sorry.

85
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,400
Are they crazy?

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,430
Find them

87
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,520
for me.

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,360
If you can't find out them,
you must find their family.

89
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,560
Even they dare to betray me.

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
I think they are tired of living.

91
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,080
After we heard the news

92
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,430
about Yu Chuxin and Mr. Zhou
getting married six months ago,

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,120
we wanted to ride on its popularity.

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,910
So we went to the restaurant
run by Yu Chuxin's parents

95
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,520
and used the pretext of
exposing fraud to gain traffic

96
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,590
while extorting hush money
from Mrs. Yu Chuxin.

97
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,450
- Have you finished?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,350
Welcome again.

99
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,120
Why is there a bug in your dish?

100
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,270
Honey,

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
quick, take a look.

102
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,270
Your restaurant can't

103
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,390
boast century-old quality.

104
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
Come, see for yourselves.

105
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,360
It wasn't like this
when I served it.

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,240
That's impossible.

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,080
- Yes.
- It is.

108
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,070
It's obvious.

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,030
Let me tell you,

110
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Tongtong is a big internet celebrity.

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
Regarding your use of gutter oil,

112
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
we'll post it online if you

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,700
don't give us 500,000 yuan

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
and you'll be dommed.

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,270
Isn't your daughter the wife
of Mr. Zhou?

116
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,430
This can't be a big deal.

117
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,800
Let's find our daughter.

118
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,630
After the edited video is posted,

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,190
Yu Chuxin's parents were
subjected to cyberbullying.

120
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,630
Then there was an explosion
at the restaurant.

121
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,160
As far as I know, it was due to
Yu Chuxin's father's sudden heart attack

122
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,830
and improper operation of the gas.

123
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,360
We were scared of

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,070
being found out.

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,430
So we went into hiding for six months.

126
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,310
They didn't give me away.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
Was it not Yu Chuxin
who tracked them down,

128
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,390
but instead they felt sorry?

129
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,190
After hiding for half a year,

130
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,870
we noticed no one
was looking for us.

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,190
We then saw the latest personnel change
in the Zhou Group,

132
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,240
and found that Mrs. Yu
had become a shareholder.

133
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,300
(President Zhou Chuming)
We wanted to

134
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,600
make up another rumor

135
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,000
so that Mrs. Yu would
pay us for public relations.

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,390
We maliciously speculated

137
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,510
that Mrs. Yu used a lot of tricks

138
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,480
to marry Zhou Chuming.

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
After all, this kind of plot is common

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,630
in movies and novels.

141
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,480
People on the internet are interested

142
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,870
in this kind of gossip.

143
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
So we stole information

144
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
of Mr. Zhou's

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,750
former assistant

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,310
and pixelated Tongtong

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,830
to impersonate the assistant
who had gone abroad.

148
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,150
Half a year later,

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,950
we ran out of money

150
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,040
and then thought of Mrs. Yu

151
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
who had wealth and power.

152
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,430
So we planned to throw mud at her

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
to gain traffic

154
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,510
and to earn hush money.

155
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,750
Hello, Chuming,

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,830
Chuxin, where are you?
I'm coming to find you.

157
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,870
Don't worry.

158
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,070
The has been resolved.

159
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,310
We agreed to

160
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
act along the play.

161
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,040
If you do so,

162
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
what should we do next?

163
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,350
Alright,

164
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
I understand.

165
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,240
Mr. Zhou, I sent you something.

166
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Take a look.

167
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,750
Tie her up.

168
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,750
Her parents' fate was unknown.

169
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,590
Her child was gone.

170
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,830
She was imprisoned for half a year.

171
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,350
Mr. Zhou,

172
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,630
if you've also experienced

173
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,160
this darkness and despair,

174
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
what would you become?

175
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,430
You should be familiar
with this sanatorium.

176
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Also,

177
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,310
I asked Zhou Yang
to cause trouble today,

178
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,510
because I know Chuxin loved you.

179
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,000
- Shut up.
- She'd rather bear it herself

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,430
(Equity Transfer Agreement)
than to hurt you,

181
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,200
Let's get a divorce.

182
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,070
and your Group.

183
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,270
So

184
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,510
I want Chuxin to break with you,

185
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,510
so that we can face our enemy.

186
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,160
I didn't know you went through that.

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,150
What's wrong?

190
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,160
What did I go through?

191
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Right.

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,070
Ye said,

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,000
she planned all of this.

194
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,710
You lost your memory.

195
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
It's okay.

196
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,030
It's okay.

197
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Alright.

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,640
I won't tease you.

199
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,040
I didn't lose my memory.

200
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,560
If I didn't pretend to have amnesia,

201
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,430
I'd have to confront them
upon returning.

202
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,670
How could I contend
with Lin Qingqing's family?

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Tell me about it.

204
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,910
This is how the events unfolded.

205
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,360
Lin Qingqing.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll make them

207
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,750
pay the price for our child

208
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
and your parents.

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Just keep your anger

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
you showed me during the day.

211
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,720
You mean

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,790
to act in front of them?

213
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll eliminate Lin Qingqing's forces
step by step.

214
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
And you, as her only ally,

215
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,480
shall make her lower her guard,

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,920
so that

217
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,960
we can find evidence of
her doing these things.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
Understood.

219
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,840
Come, hit me.

220
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,480
The Zhou Group was
built up by my father.

221
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
He gave all his lifeblood to me.

222
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,910
The Group is mine.

223
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,840
It belongs only to me.

224
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
Let me tell you,

225
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,360
no one can take even a penny
from Zhou Group,

226
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,450
including you, Yu Chuxin.

227
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
Mr. Zhou, please mind your language.

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm now speaking to you

229
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,510
as a shareholder.

230
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
You think you deserve it?

231
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,350
Chuxin,

232
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,320
are you okay?

233
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,750
Is the video taken?

234
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,910
Send it to Lin Qingqing.

235
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,550
(Chuxin, I'm sorry)

236
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,270
(Marrying me has caused you
so much pain.)

237
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,080
Hello, Chuming.

238
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Qingqing, how about

239
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,750
having dinner together tonight?

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll wait for you after work.

241
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,470
Okay.
