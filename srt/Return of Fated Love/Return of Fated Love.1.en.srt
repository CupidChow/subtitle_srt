1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,590
(Perhaps in your eyes,)

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,880
(I've always been just a weed.)

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,080
(So you have no qualms about)

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,560
(trampling me underfoot)

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,350
(and letting my body and soul)

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,910
(suffer humiliation and torment.)

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,000
(Lin Qingqing)

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,080
(Zhang Sufang)

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,240
(Zhou Chuming)

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,280
(Thank you for the suffering
you brought me.)

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,750
(Now,)

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,920
(are you ready to welcome my return?)

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,940
=Return of Fated Love=

14
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,860
=Episode 1=

15
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,670
(Zhou Chuming,)

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,870
(you said)

17
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,720
(trust is the foundation of love.)

18
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,470
Chuxin,

19
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,080
thank you for being willing to marry me.

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,230
I'll protect you for a lifetime.

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,390
(But your so-called love,)

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,950
(trust and protection)

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,920
(are so fragile)

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,120
(that others)

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
(can shatter it)

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,640
(with the simplest slander and frame.)

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,980
I sensed something was wrong
between you two from the start.

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,510
Do I need to see you in bed together

29
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,350
before you admit it?

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,870
Zhou Chuming, you jerk!

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,710
Yu Chuxin.

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,790
You dared to do this
while carrying our baby.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,230
Which one of us is the real jerk?

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
No wonder you said

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,840
you were feeling unwell

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,230
for no reason.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,950
It turns out you were having a good time
with someone else.

38
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,420
You!

39
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,230
We should get a divorce

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
sometime.

41
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,920
(Zhou Chuming, do you know?)

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,270
(From the moment
you chose to distrust me,)

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,670
(you pushed me into the quagmire.)

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,270
(Our baby,)

45
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,320
(my parents,)

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,240
(my body)

47
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,110
(and dignity)

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
(were ruthlessly harmed

49
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,270
(and trampled by that woman)

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,760
(when you abandoned me.)

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
Your dad was busy.

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,270
I don't know
how the gas could have leaked.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,190
Your parents got injured
in the explosion.

54
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,650
They are still in critical condition.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
Just come.

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,500
I'll wait for you at the operating room.

57
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,950
Hello, Chuming.

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Can you come home early tonight

59
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,590
so that we can
discuss the wedding with Mom?

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,950
Got you!

61
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,000
Now you are mine.

62
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,150
You are mine.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
Yu Chuxin.

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
You have a strong life.

65
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,960
I was near you
when you had the car accident.

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,760
So I had someone save you.

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,760
Let me tell you some unfortunate news.

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,710
Your child is gone

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,150
due to the car accident.

70
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,760
But don't worry.

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,550
I had the doctor clean you up.

72
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,640
You are very healthy now.

73
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,110
Your parents are likely
to remain in a coma.

74
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,390
Chuming also thinks
you eloped with Zhou Yang.

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590
So

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,800
no one will be looking for you.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
Here is the Lin Group's
private sanatorium.

78
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,640
Occasionally, we accept
some people with mental issues.

79
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,470
Just stay here at ease.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,390
I won't charge you any money.

81
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,070
Right.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,350
Just keep behaving like this.

83
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,270
Only this way do you
look like a madwoman.

84
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,150
And you can stay here forever.

85
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,910
Yu Chuxin,

86
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,480
you have only yourself to blame

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,350
for ending up in this situation.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,590
You stole everything
that belonged to me.

89
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,120
I just used a little trick
to take it back.

90
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,150
What's wrong?

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,510
There is no problem, right?

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,470
I even saved your life.

93
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
You should be thanking me.

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Someone, come here.

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Tie her up tightly.

96
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,470
Look at you now.

97
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,910
Do you even look like a person?

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,340
(Lin Rehabilitation Center)
Director Zheng,

99
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,440
Yu Chuxin has escaped again.

100
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
Can she run away?

101
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,270
Take her away.

102
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,470
You're mine.

103
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,380
(Inpatient Department)

104
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,830
The doctor said the probability of
your parents' recovery is very high.

105
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,910
I can understand
if you want to abandon our plan.

106
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,590
They need your company.

107
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,880
Why give up?

108
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,590
They must face judgment

109
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,150
as long as they made mistakes.

110
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Great.

111
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,750
If it weren't for
her eloping with Zhou Yang,

112
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,300
I wouldn't be able to marry Chuming.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,900
I didn't expect her
to be that kind of person.

114
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,270
Sis, don't get too excited too soon.

115
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,150
Chuming hasn't divorced yet.

116
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
Save it.

117
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,710
There is evidence of her infidelity.

118
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,450
And she's been missing for half a year.

119
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,250
Even if she doesn't appear,
the court will still grant the divorce.

120
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,150
Alright.

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,760
It'll be completely resolved next week.

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,400
Let's have a big wedding then.

123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,910
After the merger of the two companies,

124
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
you two lovebirds

125
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,830
- can live a happy…
- Mom.

126
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm done. I'll leave you to it.

127
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Chu…

128
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,600
Chuming.
