00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,070
(Message, Fang)
Chuxin, check the company intranet.

4
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,600
When Mr. Zhou concealed his identity
to intern at the company,

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,110
few people knew about his identity.

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,600
I was one of them.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,430
After Yu Chuxin knew this,

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,390
she promised to give me
her salary every month.

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,200
She asked me to create opportunities
for her to be alone with Mr. Zhou.

10
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,430
You had the authority to arrange
Mr. Zhou's position.

11
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,840
What was your position

12
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,790
at that time?

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,880
Executive Assistant.

14
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,200
This can prove my identity.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,950
Did she work here?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Yes.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,590
She worked as an executive assistant.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
However,

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,200
she resigned a few days
after Mr. Zhou took office.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,430
Now that you mention it,

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,510
I remember something.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,200
I think she made a mistake

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,520
and was fired.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,640
I haven't heard from her since then.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,840
Could the information

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,000
be true?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,560
Can you tell us more details?

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,560
We need to start with

29
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,350
the internship of Mr. Zhou.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,430
Mom, please.

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,560
I just got my master's degree,
and you want me

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
to be the vice president.

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,510
If I make mistakes, they'll laugh at me.

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,510
Give me a year. I promise,

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,230
once I'm familiar with all positions,

36
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,920
you can even make me the president.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,560
But there's no need to
start from the bottom level

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,200
and hide your identity.

39
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,840
What if they bully you?

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Can you handle it?

41
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,230
You once told me,

42
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,310
"A thousand mile
comes from every single step."

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,310
Besides, I often watch

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,840
workplace videos

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,790
and stories online.

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Trust me.

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,880
I can do it.

48
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,920
You're leaving me no choice.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Alright, do as you please.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Okay?

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
You agreed.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Thank you, Mom.

53
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,000
You're the best.

54
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,680
(Mr. Liu, Mr. Jin, Contract)
Just categorize

55
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,310
all the review materials like this.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,840
If you see

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,120
unclear fund allocation

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,440
or unknown usage,

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,390
don't ask others like an idiot.

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,480
They're always bullying the newcomers.

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Just

62
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
ask me directly.

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
Okay, Mentor.

64
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,600
But aren't you afraid of being bullied?

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,630
I have a big heart.

66
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,080
I'll ignore their criticism.

67
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,600
You newcomers

68
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
have strong self-esteem

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,990
and will run away when bullied.

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,070
You should learn from me.

71
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,040
Don't be too stubborn

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,880
or provoke them.

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,160
Just work hard

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,110
and go home happily.

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,950
Why are you looking at me so foolishly?

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,160
Do you have a problem?

77
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,760
No.

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,200
I think you're so nice.

79
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,520
No wonder those

80
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,800
well-informed newcomers said

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
I found a good mentor.

82
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,680
They must be calling me

83
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
Silly Sister behind my back.

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,880
I'm always happy like an idiot.

85
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,040
No,

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,760
I think you have an excellent mindset.

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,950
Okay, I like what you said.

88
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,480
I'll treat you to pig's trotters.

89
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,550
Pig's trotters?

90
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,790
Yes!

91
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, stop thinking about it.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,100
- Work.
- Okay.

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,710
Come on, let's eat.

94
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,470
My dad prepared an extra meal for me.

95
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,080
He made my favorite pig's trotters.

96
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,670
You're so lucky today.

97
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,230
After working overtime for so long,
I can finally rest.

98
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,880
Tomorrow, I'll get up at 1 p.m.

99
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
and go shopping in the afternoon.

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
I'll buy some clothes.

101
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,390
I totally deserve it.

102
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,070
Mentor,

103
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,710
tomorrow is a day off.

104
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,060
- How about we...?
- I'm warning you.

105
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,550
Don't take up my rest time.

106
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
Are you asking me out?

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,190
I've noticed the way

108
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,200
you looked at me.

109
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,520
Hello, Yu.

110
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
What's wrong?

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,110
I'm eating. It's delicious.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Another...

113
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,390
Another blind date? Are you crazy?

114
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,070
I have to go.

115
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,910
Talk to you later.

116
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,870
Stop staring at me.

117
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,200
Haven't you heard of blind dates?

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Hurry up and eat,

119
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,000
and then get back to work.

120
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,790
Uncle, Auntie, I'm sorry.

121
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm late because of the traffic jam.

122
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,240
I am Yu Chuxin's boyfriend.

123
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,270
I'm Zhou Chuming.

124
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,320
What's going on here?

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,360
I thought Mr. Zhou
wouldn't be interested in her,

126
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
and she would fail,

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,870
so I didn't refuse the opportunity
to earn extra money.

128
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,790
But I never expected that

129
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,750
Yu Chuxin would be so scheming.

130
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,000
She pretended to be innocent

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,950
and seduced him.

132
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,040
She fooled Mr. Zhou easily

133
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,680
and really became his wife.

134
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,000
Chuxin, do you know why the company

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,880
suddenly organized such a grand banquet?

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,310
No specific reason.

137
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,240
Why do you care?

138
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,040
Listen to me!

139
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,920
Stop pouring the wine!

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,830
I got the news

141
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,430
that Miss Zhang

142
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,640
has some heart issues.

143
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,240
She wants her son to take over as CEO.

144
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,080
Today is his inauguration ceremony.

145
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,430
Enough.

146
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,470
It's none of our business.

147
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,720
Just focus on your work.

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,030
Okay, I'll get back to work.

149
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,020
(Message, Zhou Chuming)

150
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,350
Something happened at home.

151
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,190
I will be away for a few days.

152
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll explain it when I get back.

153
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,940
Everyone,

154
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
Miss Zhang is unwell

155
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,140
and needs to rest for a while.

156
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,390
From now on,

157
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,640
all matters

158
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,830
will be handled by our new president,
Zhou Chuming.

159
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,080
Let's welcome Mr. Zhou to give a speech.

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Ye,

161
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,760
don't you think

162
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,150
this person looks familiar?

163
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,510
She's the online celebrity Tong Tong.

164
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
I told you

165
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,350
we would meet her soon.

166
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
See?

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,150
Didn't Lin Qingqing
just deliver her to us?

168
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,030
The video has gone viral.

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,430
It'll definitely have

170
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,830
a negative impact on your group.

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,190
I think they might...

172
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,000
If we can solve this,

173
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,800
it'll become my bulletproof vest.

174
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,240
They'll have no excuse to attack me.

175
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,830
If we can't,

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
let's leave it to fate.

177
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,320
The PR Department has tried its best,

178
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,640
but the video is so viral

179
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
that we can't control the media.

180
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,150
We tried to contact that girl,

181
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,680
but she moved overseas.

182
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,240
We can't get in touch with her.

183
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,240
Can we confirm
the person in the video is her?

184
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,600
Mr. Zhou,

185
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
her identity doesn't matter.

186
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,000
We've suffered a great loss.

187
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,640
What we should do now
is to cut our losses.

188
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,280
Miss Yu,

189
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,920
the shareholding contract clearly says

190
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
that if the company's

191
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,120
reputation and interests are damaged
because of you,

192
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,350
the board will have the right
to reclaim your shares.

193
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,430
On behalf of the board,
I hereby announce

194
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,430
that from now on,

195
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,830
all your positions are revoked.

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,550
We'll hold a board meeting

197
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,910
to discuss the arrangements

198
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,070
of your shares.

199
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,030
Okay,

200
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,190
I got it.

201
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,320
Well done.

202
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,390
In two days,

203
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,590
you'll buy the six-percent share.

204
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Rest assured,

205
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,800
no one will compete with you.

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,030
Lin Qingqing,

207
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,390
you finally did something good.

208
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,270
Zhou Yang,

209
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,830
no matter what Lin Qingqing gave you,

210
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,950
I hope you can remain calm.

211
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
Don't let her use you.

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,920
Chuxin,

213
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,240
I didn't ask you out to talk about this.

214
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,920
Ye and you have always wanted to know

215
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,120
where Tong Tong is, right?

216
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,710
These are the places

217
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,350
where they might be hiding.

218
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,800
I hope it can help you.

219
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,390
Thank you.
