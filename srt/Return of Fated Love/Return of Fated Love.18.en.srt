=Episode 18=

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
By the way,

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,720
after Yu Chuxin reported
Lin Qingqing to the police,

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,320
the story of how she
and Chuming got together

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,790
was uncovered.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,880
Now the topic is trending,

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,470
so let's take advantage of it.

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,000
Nowadays, people

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,670
seem to buy into this kind of persona.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,840
We'll turn them into

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,600
a model young couple

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,150
and empower them.

14
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,240
We'll

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
double the value of

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,200
our collaborative project.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,310
We can also let them eliminate

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,000
the parasites within the Group.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,000
But

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,760
they're your relatives.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,390
Just a bunch of useless people.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,830
I let them occupy positions
in the early years

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,280
to consolidate my right to speak.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
Now,

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,430
there are few obstacles
left to block me.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,030
What value do they have now?

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
That's true.

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,670
Anyway, it's Zhou Chuming and Yu Chuxin

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,270
who kick them out.

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,470
They can only hate them if they want to.

31
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,310
You can find chances

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,880
to comfort them,

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,310
and give them some benefits,

34
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,080
and they'll still be grateful to you.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,920
I just want to provide Chuchu

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,150
with a clean working environment.

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,950
I don't want her to go through
what I've gone through

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
as a widow.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,000
It was difficult for me

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,150
to do anything.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,950
Dear,

42
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,560
you're not a widow,

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
you have me.

44
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,520
Lin Qingqing left,

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,760
and now Lin Chuchu has come.

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,230
I don't quite know her.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,130
What do you think?

48
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,870
This girl thinks unusually

49
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,480
and her actions are not bound by norms.

50
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,360
She doesn't seem like
from a business family.

51
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,200
But she is clever and quick-witted.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
I can't tell anything else.

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,480
Let's hope she behaves herself.

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,840
Otherwise, I'll consider

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
abandoning the merger.

56
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,230
Mr. Zhou, Mrs. Yu,

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,480
Miss Lin Chuchu
has arrived at the office.

58
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,710
Let's go.

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
We'll know about her

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,790
after more interactions.

61
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,670
Go.

62
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,670
Great.

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,680
Chuming, Chuxin.

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,760
You haven't left yet?

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Chuchu, you're

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,520
taking office as Vice President today.

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,950
There should be a formal process.

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,660
How about holding a mid-to-high-level
meeting this afternoon

69
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,080
so everyone can get to know you?

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
No, no.

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,710
Please spare me.

72
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,670
I'm good at trash-talking in games.

73
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,760
But I can't

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,600
handle the meeting.

75
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,390
It's a formality anyway.

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,110
Or I'm afraid Mr. Lin
will have opinions.

77
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,320
Then let him keep them to himself.

78
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,870
I haven't had enough fun.

79
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,160
And now I'm dragged into work.

80
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,510
It's not humane.

81
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,510
Chuming.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
Chuxin,

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
I don't understand business projects.

84
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,110
If you ever need my effort,

85
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,200
I'll support you.

86
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,990
But can I

87
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,390
arrange my work schedule?

88
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I will listen to you.

89
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
Also,

90
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,950
my dad has old-fashioned ideas.

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,590
Family-managed businesses

92
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,880
rarely go far.

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,830
When a company goes to a certain point,

94
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,830
they should find good
professional managers.

95
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,110
And

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,800
you perfectly meet my criteria for

97
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
good professional managers.

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,080
Besides, you hold more shares
in the company than I do,

99
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,360
so I'll leave it to you.

100
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,110
I'm begging you.

101
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,710
I'll take it as a yes

102
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,270
if you don't speak.

103
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,840
I have to watch a match with a friend.

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,390
I'll count on you about the company.

105
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,230
Bye-bye.

106
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,920
It's hard to figure her out.

107
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,390
Let's complete

108
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,920
our tasks first.

109
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,070
As for her,

110
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,830
just adapt to the situation.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,030
Your annual dividends
are not enough for you,

112
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,650
and now you want more from the company?

113
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,960
The project is going on slowly,

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,230
the plan is full of loopholes,

115
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,910
and the use of funds is in utter chaos.

116
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,030
Why still keep you around?

117
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,350
To raise you as a parasite?

118
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,350
Zhou Chuming,

119
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm your uncle,

120
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,830
so speak to me with a bit more respect.

121
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,640
How can you casually dismiss us?

122
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Who gave you the authority?

123
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,560
Did you ask my sister?

124
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,510
She is the chairman of this Group.

125
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,640
Currently, the Group's decisions
are made by the three of us.

126
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
It doesn't require Chairman's consent

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,950
to remove a parasite.

128
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,590
I support Mr. Zhou's decision.

129
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,800
I also support Chuming.

130
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,680
I now officially notify you that

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,950
you've been dismissed.

132
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,550
Hello?

133
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Chairman Zhang.

134
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,280
Chuming,

135
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,390
after an internal evaluation,

136
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,680
I found out about these
outstanding employees

137
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
with trustworthy characters.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,510
I think they can
fill the vacant positions.

139
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,140
(Internal Review Evaluation Survey)

140
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
Good.

141
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,960
You should assign them

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,680
with specific job positions

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
based on their work abilities.

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,830
I have no objections.

145
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
By the way,

146
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,510
I found an issue with
the equity distribution

147
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,080
when I was organizing the documents.

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,640
Besides Mom's and our shares

149
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
and other shareholders,

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
why is there still
ten percent of the shares

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,240
held by an overseas
trust fund on behalf?

152
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,720
Grandfather did it on purpose

153
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
when allocating the shares.

154
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,680
He entrusted ten percent of the shares

155
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,200
to the trust fund.

156
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
The dividends each year
are kept in their hands

157
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,590
to leave a way out for the Zhou family.

158
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,590
The descendants can still
to turn the tables

159
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,710
in critical times.

160
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Hello, Manager Sun.

161
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
What?

162
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,030
The three contractors
collectively withdrew?

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
What is the reason?

164
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,760
The suppliers stopped supplying

165
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,480
(Mr. Zhang: Cooperation is suspended)
so they withdrew?

166
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,560
Alright, I see.

167
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,990
I'll look into it and get back to you.

168
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,830
Chuming, all five suppliers

169
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,320
have stopped supplying
with the excuse of

170
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,600
insufficient production capacity

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,150
and shortage of funds.

172
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,350
The contractors won't

173
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,520
wait around with no goods.

174
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
So they withdrew.

175
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,510
But the first payment

176
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,240
has been delivered to the suppliers.

177
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,760
They use such obvious excuses to delay.

178
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,350
This seems like a breach
of contract.

179
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not that simple.

180
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
Let's go talk to them first

181
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,590
and see what's going on.

182
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,430
Judging from

183
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,000
their unyielding attitude,

184
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,030
they're determined to breach the contract.

185
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,590
I suggest we don't waste time with them

186
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,560
and look for new suppliers.

187
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
I agree with you.

188
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,040
I've scheduled two suppliers

189
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
for discussions tomorrow.

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,700
As long as their prices are not
higher than the market average price,

191
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,150
we can sign the contract on the spot.

192
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,350
They can start
supplying within three days.

193
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,830
The contractors also said

194
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,680
if there's stock,

195
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,950
they'll come back at any time.

196
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,510
I feel

197
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,680
that it's not that simple.

198
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,270
Everything happened suddenly,

199
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,800
even somewhat inexplicably.

200
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,800
It feels like

201
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,950
there's a hand behind us.

202
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,660
(Tribute to Zhou Group)

203
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,640
We agreed at ten o'clock.

204
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,000
It's been an hour past that.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,990
And they haven't arrived.

206
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,150
Let's wait a bit longer.

207
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Maybe they had something
come up last minute.

208
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,990
After all, we're asking for their help.

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,950
It's understandable if they do this.

210
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,350
In that case, they should make a call.

211
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,380
(Supplier Mr. Yang)

212
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,920
Mr. Zhou, I apologize.

213
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,080
I can't discuss it today.

214
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
My housekeeper is occupied.

215
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,640
I need to pick up my child.

216
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
By the way, Mr. Sun's wife
is giving birth today.

217
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,550
He also asked me to
convey his apologies to you.

218
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,670
I'll hang up.

219
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,640
Tutoring class, giving birth.

220
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,830
It sounds absurd.

221
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,510
It seems I was right.

222
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,590
Someone is up to no good
behind the scenes.

223
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,030
What's going on, leaders?

224
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,200
Has the Project

225
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,470
encountered a problem?

226
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Didn't you say

227
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,470
we're parasites in your group?

228
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,880
How come you can even carry the project?

229
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,080
Who let you in?

230
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,030
Zhou Chuming,

231
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,240
I came here today to tell you

232
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,590
that it was done by us.

233
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,400
The Group can manage without you

234
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,990
but not without us.

235
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,590
It'd be impossible to move forward.

236
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,470
Don't feel

237
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,480
so conceited

238
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,870
that you think you're

239
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,920
the savior of the Group.

240
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,880
Bah!

241
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,920
Get out of here

242
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,350
or don't blame me for being rude.

243
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,470
Wait a minute.

244
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,870
(So it was really you.)

245
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,200
Mr. Zhou, Mrs. Yu.

246
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,870
The personnel dismissals

247
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,310
you proposed to the Board of Directors

248
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,440
was evaluated

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,230
and we think you're not capable enough

250
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,160
and not qualified.

251
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,040
Recently, we've received
multiple reports against you.

252
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
After investigation,

253
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,510
we believe that there
are obvious major errors

254
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,350
in several decisions.

255
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,870
Given the current situation,

256
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
we believe

257
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,520
you're no longer competent
for your current positions.

258
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,520
So it has been decided

259
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,110
to suspend you from your duties.

260
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,190
I have an objection.

261
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,080
Chuming, you and Chuxin

262
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,870
have been working for the company.

263
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,630
You should take a good rest.

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,440
Didn't you encounter some trouble?

265
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,230
It's a good chance for you
to take a vacation.

266
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm now fully recovered.

267
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,800
I can help share some of the burden.

268
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,040
So let me handle

269
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,110
these troubles for you.

270
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,800
Mom,

271
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,960
although Chuxin and I only hold

272
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,040
39% of the equity in Zhou Group,

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,350
excluding the 10% held
by the trust fund,

274
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,790
you and the other shareholders

275
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,920
only hold 50% of the equity.

276
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,830
You don't have absolute control
as the chairman.

277
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm afraid you can't strip away
the right to speak

278
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,560
of Chuxin and me.

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,520
Is that so?

280
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,320
Chuming, are you asking
who has more shares?

281
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,230
Add another one percent of mine.

282
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,430
In this way,

283
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Chairman Zhang will have

284
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
51% of the shares

285
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,230
and can dispose of you at will.
