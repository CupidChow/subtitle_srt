=Return of Fated Love=

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,150
As far as I know, it was due to
Yu Chuxin's father's sudden heart attack

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,750
and improper operation of the gas.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,040
Chuming.

6
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,880
Do you believe

7
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,710
this video?

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,880
Ever since she threatened me
with the Zhou family's equity,

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,710
I won't believe

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,470
anything about her.

11
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,150
I suspect that the two people

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,350
were bribed by her.

13
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,230
Zhou Group is your father's lifeblood.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Not only did she deceive you
to obtain the shares,

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,920
but she spent so much money
to cover up her crime.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,350
She has no bottom line.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,950
Anyone who makes

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,430
a mistake should be punished.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Qingqing, trust me.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
I've seen through everything.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,600
As long as you deserve,

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,460
I'll do my utmost to
help you achieve it.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
Chuming,

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
no matter what,

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,590
I'll always be by your side.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Let's first think about

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,310
how to deal with them tomorrow.

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,870
(Yu Chuxin)

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,560
(Even if you clear your name, so what?)

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,480
(Enjoy your triumph
for now.)

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,510
(After all, the Internet has no memory.)

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,840
(Now you've lost Chuming,)

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
(you'll soon know)

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,480
(what you can be.)

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,710
It was unexpected.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
Nice play

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,430
for Mrs. Yu.

38
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,070
Not only did she clear her name

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,230
but she restored her nobility

40
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,680
in the Group over the past years.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,310
What, you believed it?

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,120
It doesn't matter.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,630
We've benefited from it.

44
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Now the internet is praising her

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,030
for her independence.

46
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,430
Chairman Zhang,

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,750
you haven't seen it.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
This morning, many of our products

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,120
were sold out.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,430
So, what does
the Board of Directors mean?

51
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,590
The shares won't be repurchased?

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,870
Chairman Zhang,

53
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,240
why repurchase?

54
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,430
The Board of Directors claims

55
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,360
to make her a brand ambassador.

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,340
If that's the case,

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,910
our company will become more valuable.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
We'll have more right to speak

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,870
with the merger with Lin's company.

60
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,470
I disagree.

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,430
I no longer have any feelings for her.

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,030
The shares must be taken back.

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,870
Mr. Zhou,

64
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,710
the market is like this now.

65
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,120
A major internet celebrity

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
can bring the Group

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,470
a massive amount of profit.

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,430
Don't go against money.

69
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,870
This kind of short-term profit…

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,710
Enough, Chuming.

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
That's settled.

72
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,630
Chuxin's shares remain unchanged.

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,750
Additionally, she'll assume
the position of executive director.

74
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Mom.

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
The position is...

76
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,150
Hello, hello.

77
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
Yes, the website

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
can be updated now.

79
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,470
Yes, Chairman Zhang has agreed
to the personnel change.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
Keep Director Yu's popularity up.

81
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,910
Yes, the brand ambassador.

82
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Operating income, operating cost.

83
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Chuxin.

84
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,840
These are gifts from your fans.

85
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,870
What's going on?

86
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,030
What fans?

87
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
You don't know?

88
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,710
You're popular online now.

89
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,910
You have millions of fans.

90
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,750
Yes.

91
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,310
Many people, after watching the video,

92
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,150
apologized to you,

93
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,310
and became your fans.

94
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,400
There are also many people

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
saying you are pure and kind,

96
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,030
and they want to beat Mr. Zhou

97
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,360
and take you back as their wife.

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,870
It won't last.

99
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,470
You're pretending to be pure.

100
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,960
But no matter how much you pretend,

101
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,470
it can't cover up the smell of mud on you

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,240
and your disgusting desire
to climb up the social ladder.

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,630
I advise you to

104
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,840
hand over Chuming's shares, otherwise...

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,710
I obtained it with effort.

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,750
Why should I?

107
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,280
You finally admit

108
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,310
that you schemed your way
into the Zhou family.

109
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,400
What, you think you've won now

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,430
so you're not pretending?

111
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Let me tell you.

112
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
You…

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
Are you scared of being beaten by me?

114
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,630
Then don't be so foul-mouthed.

115
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Trash.

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
She,

117
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,480
she just insulted me.

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,630
She called me trash.

119
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,720
I didn't hear it.

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Were you deaf?

121
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,150
Who dares to call me

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,310
like that besides my dad?

123
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,430
Why didn't you slap her?

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,950
I... I...

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
Why stammer?

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,950
You are trash too.

127
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,220
(Chuxin, I'm sorry.)

128
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,660
(Chuxin, I'll take care of you.)

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Chuming,

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,750
you saw

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
how she's good at pretending.

132
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,040
We need to come up with a plan

133
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,240
to get her out.

134
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,680
Look, she just took office.

135
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,390
And she's bypassed us

136
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,720
to appoint the new project leader

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,350
with the support of the Board.

138
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,230
And

139
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,950
she didn't even say a word

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,960
before signing the contract

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,430
for the Shengqiang Group's Project.

142
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,310
If this continues,

143
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
the Group might as well goes to her.

144
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,240
At least part of my parents' grievances
have been redressed.

145
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,140
With Tongtong and Sun Li,

146
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,020
(Assistant's Office)

147
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,040
we can challenge Lin Qingqing at any time.

148
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Here comes

149
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,750
the thing about my child.

150
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
It's hard to find relevant
surveillance footage.

151
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,560
I will follow up.

152
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,310
Criminal Psychology suggests

153
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,600
that some perpetrators, even if
they instruct others,

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,360
will also observe the scene.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,160
Considering Lin Qingqing's

156
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,510
wish of tearing me to pieces,

157
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,360
she must have been nearby

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,070
when I crashed.

159
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,950
We need to obtain the dashcam,

160
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,270
maybe we can find something.

161
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,230
Okay.

162
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
What's going on about

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
the two contacts?

164
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,740
Why was the contract signed
without my consent?

165
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,040
Mr. Zhou, this is an order from

166
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Mrs. Zhang and the Board.

167
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,950
These two projects are assigned to me.

168
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,600
The reason is that considering
my current popularity,

169
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,720
these two projects

170
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,830
can quickly boost our revenue.

171
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
What?

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Could you have an issue with money?

173
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Miss Lin,

174
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,040
don't leave yet.

175
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,070
Take a look at this.
