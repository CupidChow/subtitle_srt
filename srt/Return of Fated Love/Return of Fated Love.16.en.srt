2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,230
Ye, you know I used to

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,470
have a good relationship
with your sister.

5
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,520
She often talked about you
in front of me.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,200
She thought you were her pride.

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,030
So when my sister
was harmed by Lin Qingqing,

8
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,600
why didn't you help her?

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,880
If I had helped,

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,200
I'd have been sent to

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,560
the sanatorium like your sister.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,000
Alright, Security will be here soon.

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,840
Whether you have issues with me

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,900
or hold grudges against me,

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
find another time.

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,510
Please convey what I'm going to

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,280
tell you next to Miss Yu.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,120
Although the car record
was deleted by Lin Qingqing,

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,150
I have kept a backup.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,760
I have recordings of all the things

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,350
Lin Qingqing told me to do,

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,790
enough to bring her down.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,760
Give them to me.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,710
Ye, I have evidence.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,150
But I need a reason
to hand it over to you.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,150
What do you want?

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
Money?

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,350
I want the same thing as you.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,870
I want to ruin Lin Qingqing

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,310
and make her pay for what she has done.

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,150
I can give it to you,

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,350
but I hope you can

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,950
strike her decisively.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't want the evidence
I obtained through humiliation

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,200
fails to ruin her.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
Strike her?

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Is this enough?

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
You destroyed the car record.

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,920
Handle those involved in this

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
with caution.

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll think about it.

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,180
(All recordings)

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
I want her dead.

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,560
Zhou Chuming, let's see

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
how you can get away

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,120
with this.

47
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,800
Last night, I met with Yu Chuxin.

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,560
She wants what I have.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
What do you think?

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
To give or not?

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
Lin Qingqing's workplace bullying

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,840
has caused me immense mental damage.

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,030
I wish I could
see her brought to justice.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,350
But I'm worried that after

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,680
Lin Qingqing is arrested,

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,500
it might damage
the reputation of Lin Group.

57
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,590
You are a good person,

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,950
and you helped me a lot.

59
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
I don't want to see you

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
overwhelmed after taking over Lin Group.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,630
Let's do as you said.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,870
Whoever breaks the law will be punished.

63
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,630
Don't worry about me, go ahead.

64
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,750
Hello, sir.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Are you 9537?

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Mr. Wang.

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
It's me.

68
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,550
Zhou Yang?

69
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,840
I didn't recognize you.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,850
We haven't seen each other for years.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,910
Ever since you stopped
being Zhou's driver,

72
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,990
we haven't seen each other.

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,990
It must have been eight or nine years.

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,150
Time flies.

75
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,430
You were just a teenager back then,

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,280
and now you've grown into a young man.

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,280
Mr. Wang, I came to find you this time.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,500
You were Zhou's driver
for over ten years,

79
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,400
so you must have seen a lot of things.

80
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,240
Do you remember the thing

81
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,270
about my parents?

82
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,310
I have a terminal illness.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,150
There isn't much time left.

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,800
I've been receiving treatment

85
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,470
from my doctor friend

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
during this period.

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,710
I sneaked out to see you

88
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,630
this time.

89
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,120
If you know about the past,

90
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
please tell me.

91
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,150
Just consider it fulfilling

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,870
a small wish of a dying person.

93
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,710
Back then…

94
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,590
Chairman Lin,

95
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,910
I'll take my leave now.

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Director Zheng.

97
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,920
Dad, come back here!

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
Stop!

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
Dad,

100
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,040
what's going on here?

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Director Zheng feels guilty.

102
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,480
He went to turn himself in.

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
Dad, you can't let him.

104
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,240
I dealt with Zhou Chuming

105
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,830
as you requested.

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,750
You can't give up on me like this.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,310
I haven't given up on you.

108
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,560
It's you who have given up on yourself.

109
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,590
Qingqing,

110
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,950
can't you learn

111
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,630
how to look for reasons within yourself?

112
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,390
Reflect on yourself.

113
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,590
Dad.

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,000
Dad.

115
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,120
Alright.

116
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,390
You've made so many mistakes.

117
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,390
You should have expected
this day to come.

118
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,800
You're lucky to be the eldest
Miss of the Lin family.

119
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,790
But you can bully me

120
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,360
since childhood.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Now you dare to disregard human lives

122
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,430
to satisfy your desires.

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,640
Just go.

124
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
There's no place for you
at home anymore.

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Why should I leave?

126
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,670
I won't.

127
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,310
Don't you understand?

128
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,150
Dad said,

129
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,190
you're naturally narrow-minded.

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
You like to take other people's things
for yourself and

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
don't know how to share.

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,800
You can't take over the group

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
with your personality.

134
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,160
The Heir of the Group

135
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
has always been

136
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,150
me.

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,390
It's best to turn yourself in

138
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,920
and seek leniency.

139
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,950
If you wait until the day you're caught,

140
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,300
you'll have no tears left to cry.

141
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,160
You can't do this to me.

142
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,390
You can't do this to me.

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,270
You wanted me to do whatever it takes

144
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,450
to get close to Zhou Chuming.

145
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,920
That's why I did these things.

146
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Look.

147
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,120
There are many proper ways to do things.

148
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,390
You chose

149
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,430
those devious methods.

150
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
And now you want to blame me?

151
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,830
I can't argue with you.

152
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,600
Reflect on yourself.

153
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,150
No.

154
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,920
You can't treat me like this.

155
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,160
You can't treat me like this.

156
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
What should I do?

157
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
Zhou Chuming.

158
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,680
Zhou Chuming.

159
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,110
Zhou Chuming.

160
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
Answer the phone, Zhou Chuming.

162
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,600
The number you dialed is out of service.

163
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,720
You made me do this!

164
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,510
You made me do this!

165
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm not wrong.

166
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
You want me to die.

167
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,830
But I refuse.

168
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,750
Why did you make up your mind?

169
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,950
Because the ending
you arranged for Lin Qingqing

170
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
is what I want the most.

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,850
(Regarding the investigation report on
Lin Qingqing's corruption and bribery)

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,840
Mrs.Yu,

173
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,720
there is one more thing
I forgot to give you.

174
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Please come back for it.

175
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
Okay, a moment.
