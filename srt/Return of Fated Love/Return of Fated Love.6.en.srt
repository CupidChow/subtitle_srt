=Episode 6=

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,520
Auntie Sufang.

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,110
These flowers are more elegant

5
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,280
after trimming.

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,870
Qingqing.

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,960
Something is inherently lowly.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,600
Any refinement cannot
change its nature.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
These flowers are elegant

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,110
because they are expensive.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,710
Auntie, you're right.

12
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,790
I still have to learn more from you
in the future.

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,400
Especially today,

14
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,710
we two Groups

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,870
officially announced
merger and reorganization.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,840
But I'm still uncertain
about something

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,920
and want to ask you.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,510
We've been preparing for this
for so long.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,590
And we originally planned
to get married

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,840
right after finishing
this issue.

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,710
But now she's back

22
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,470
and been scheming

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,950
behind my back.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,400
Chuming's attitude is also unclear.

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,230
I'm afraid

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,590
that something might
go wrong today.

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,000
Auntie, before Uncle passed away,
it's his greatest wish

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,950
to integrate resources
in the relevant fields

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,310
and create a first-class group
in this industry.

30
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,790
Right now, only a strong alliance
between our two families

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,630
can make it happen.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,350
Since you love Uncle so much,

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,790
you wouldn't want anything

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,190
to go wrong at this
crucial moment

35
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,590
and let everything fall through.

36
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,510
Qingqing, don't worry.

37
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,350
There won't be any problem today.

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,200
Chuming will marry you.

39
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,080
He knows what's
the most important.

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,630
So do I.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,090
Auntie Sufang, there are
so many people today.

43
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,630
You're beautiful today.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,520
- Thank you.
- Mr. Zhang.

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,430
At such a young age,

46
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,470
Miss Lin becomes Vice President
of the Zhou Group.

47
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,080
It's based on your
excellent upbringing.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,430
Qingqing is still young.

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,240
She still lacks experience
in handling things.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Hope everyone will
support and help her

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,080
in the future.

52
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,150
With strong alliance between
Zhou and Lin families,

53
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,560
we will depend on you
in the future.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,870
No problem.

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,560
- Cheers
- I'd appreciate your help.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Mr. Qin.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,780
Long time no see.

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
Keep an eye on Yu Chuxin.

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,900
Don't let her leave her room
even for one second.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,240
(Message from Auntie Su)
Good. Are you satisfied?

61
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,710
Very good.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Auntie.

63
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,840
Chuming is at the entrance

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,910
- and coming right now.
- Right?

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,320
- Okay.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Let's welcome Zhou ChuMing,

67
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,700
President of the Zhou Group,
with warm applause.

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,430
Isn't it said that
they got divorced?

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
They seem to be deeply attached
to each other.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,150
Yu Chuxin.

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,080
Auntie Sufang.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,190
Chuming must have his reasons.

73
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,960
Let's talk about it
after this matter is done.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Qingqing, show your smile.

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't let others make fun of us.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,470
Don't mind it. Smile.

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,780
Don't let others laugh at us.

78
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,120
We plan to complete the merger

79
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,510
of we two groups within a year.

80
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,870
In the service industry,
the Zhou Group

81
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,070
has almost monopolized
all the upstream suppliers.

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Yu Chuxin.

83
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,190
You are always causing trouble.

84
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,430
Why don't you just die?

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,630
You think your loss of memory

86
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,390
can erase the fact
that you cheated?

87
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,830
Wouldn't it be too easy
to let you off?

88
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,310
You, the chief culprit, are still living well.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,920
But why should I,

90
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,350
the victim, die?

91
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,560
I get it now.

92
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,070
Don't you probably think

93
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,600
your frame-up was perfect?

94
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,670
Why?

95
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,950
Why don't you continue to pretend?

96
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,610
What's the point of pretending
with someone like you?

97
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
What?

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,630
You want to expose me to Chuming?

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Then go ahead.

100
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,550
See he'll believe you or me.

101
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,470
I forgot to tell you.

102
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,760
In the past two days,

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,750
I've been sleeping with Chuming

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,120
in our marital bed.

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,430
Yu Chuxin.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Chuming is mine.

107
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,310
You stay away from him.

108
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
Right.

109
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
You wait.

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,680
I'll send you to the rest center
right now

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,310
so that you will never escape.

112
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,630
Is that all you can do?

113
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,560
Why can't you have more things
to threaten me?

114
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,590
Like...

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
My parents at ICU.

116
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,230
Or

117
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,430
the baby Chuming and I will have.

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Lin Qingqing.

119
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,510
I know you like Chuming

120
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,360
and you are not satisfied
with our marriage.

121
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,680
But today is a big day
for the Group.

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,630
I think you should notice
the occasion.

123
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,750
Occasion?

124
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,630
For you,

125
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,560
it's occasion.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But for me,

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,830
they are all dogs
begging for my charity.

128
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,000
Auntie Sufang is really silly.

129
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,950
A small thing could have been
solved with PR.

130
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,870
But you still got married
to address it.

131
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,870
Yu Chuxin.

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,000
You...you framed me.

133
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,030
Shut up.

134
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,310
Every guest here today

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,870
is who our company relies on.

136
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,630
My mother-in-law is still energetic.

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Every decision she made is precise.

138
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,680
How dare you

139
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,160
insult her so randomly?

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,750
I'm sorry, everyone.

141
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,390
Miss. Lin is delighted

142
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,360
and drinks too much today.

143
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,200
She's joking around.

144
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Mom.

145
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,240
Take Miss. Lin back to rest.

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,270
The drama today is quite interesting.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Indeed.

148
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,950
That slap was really powerful.

149
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,870
She truly lives up to being the daughter-in-law
of the Zhou family.

150
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,710
Right.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,190
The Lin family really loses face this time.

152
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,030
Chuming.

153
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,150
Chuxin.

154
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,870
Thanks for you today.
Let's go home.

155
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
Sister.

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,720
You're such a waste.

157
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,560
Are you blind? Come here.

158
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,630
You better show up tomorrow

159
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,340
and take Yu Chuxin away.

160
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,250
I want her to live worse
than a dog

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
for the rest of her life.
