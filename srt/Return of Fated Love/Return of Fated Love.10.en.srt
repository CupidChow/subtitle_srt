00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,860
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Miss Lin, your coffee.

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,360
Why is there interference?

5
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,920
Did they find us?

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
(Chuxin, I'm sorry.)

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
(I lied to you again.)

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,920
(I decided to continue
overhearing on Lin Qingqing.)

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,840
(You helped my sister escape from
the misery caused by Lin Qingqing,)

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,030
(so I must help you find the evidence)

11
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,760
(of her crimes as soon as possible.)

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,600
(Rest assured.)

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
(When this is over,)

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,590
(I will turn myself in)

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,480
(and take responsibility
for what I did.)

16
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,710
Organize the information about

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,280
the truth of Zhou Yang's parents' death

18
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,070
and give it to him.

19
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,560
Didn't you say you wanted
to use the information

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,670
to force him to work for us?

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,510
Zhang Sufang always
prioritizes interests above all else.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
Now that the nasty woman Yu Chuxin

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,000
holds six percent of the shares,

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,760
she definitely wouldn't dare
to let them divorce for now.

25
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,480
In that case,

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,150
why should I care about others?

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,390
After all, all I want is Zhou Chuming.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,870
Do you want to get Zhou Yang into this
to deal with Zhang Sufang?

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,920
Zhou Yang still can't
get over his parents' death,

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,150
right?

31
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,030
If he knew

32
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,200
what Zhang Sufang did to his parents,

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,150
what do you think he would do?

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,310
Would he seek revenge?

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
When that happens,

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,590
Zhang Sufang would be
so busy dealing with Zhou Yang

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,590
that she won't have energy
to support Yu Chuxin.

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
Whether it's Yu Chuxin

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
or anyone else,

40
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,030
if they dare to oppose me,

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,150
they'll all go to hell.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,830
Miss Yu,

43
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,440
are you in the wrong seat?

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,710
Miss Zhang has fully authorized me
to exercise her rights on her behalf.

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,630
Why don't you call her and ask her

46
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,040
if I should sit here?

47
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,630
Okay.

48
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,600
Then let's get to the point.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,630
Our two Groups

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,680
are expected to complete

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,200
the consolidation and restructuring
of all industries within a year.

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,040
The first step

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,430
is to integrate

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,240
all the hotel businesses

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,230
of our groups

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,950
and establish a new brand.

57
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,670
We're having this meeting

58
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,040
to select a project leader

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,160
who will form a team

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
and implement this project.

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
They are the candidates

62
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
we previously considered suitable.

63
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,550
Who is capable of doing this job?

64
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,630
Mr. Zhou,

65
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,510
what's your opinion?

66
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,240
Chattering like a few crows

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
and spouting nonsense noisily.

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,710
Did you say this?

69
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,270
Zhu Yuanzhang said it.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
How dare you?

71
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,990
Which department is he from?

72
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,630
You...

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Great.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,990
I don't care who said it.

75
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,520
You wrote this in the superior's

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,760
financial report.

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
What is your attitude?

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,710
What do you want?

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Mr. Wang,

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,230
so, do you think

81
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,280
it's right to falsely report

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,390
the expenditure of funds?

83
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,150
The higher-ups
have their own considerations.

84
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,600
Are you qualified to handle this?

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,440
You only need to sign it.

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
If you had a bit of sense,

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,520
you wouldn't have done it.

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,390
Well, in that case,

89
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,200
sorry, I can't sign this.

90
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,510
Then get out!

91
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,830
Others can sign this.

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,040
Then find someone else.

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
You...

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Miss Lin,

95
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,390
I want to hear your opinion first.

96
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,950
Mr. Wang is very capable,

97
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,600
and he's led many large projects.

98
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,790
Therefore, I think

99
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,390
he's the best choice.

100
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,310
This project

101
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,960
is the top priority in our planning.

102
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,910
Ability is definitely
the primary criterion,

103
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,350
but it's not enough.

104
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
We should also

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,480
consider one's character

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,760
when making the decision.

107
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,270
Chuming,

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,630
I worked in his department

109
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,800
for four years.

110
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,680
He's always admired and respected

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880
by colleagues.

112
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
He's

113
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,590
a trustworthy man.

114
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,240
Chuxin,

115
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm afraid

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
it might not convince everyone.

117
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,950
Honey,

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,640
what do you mean?

119
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,320
How about this?

120
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,120
Let's conduct an internal review

121
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,790
of the three candidates.

122
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,920
After the evaluation,

123
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560
the board will make the decision.

124
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,590
I believe

125
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,800
our candidates will pass the test.

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Miss Lin,

127
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
don't you agree?

128
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
I...

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,590
I agree.

130
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,680
Miss Lin,

131
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,440
maybe you should find someone else.

132
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
I want to quit

133
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,510
this time, okay?

134
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,120
You can't be investigated.

135
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
Get out!

136
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,200
Completely useless.

137
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,830
What about Zhou Yang?

138
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,870
After I sent the info to him,

139
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,030
he blocked me.

140
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,800
So ungrateful!

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,440
Forget it.

142
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,590
Let's put him aside.

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,710
The most urgent task now

144
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,920
is to get rid of

145
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
the troublemaker Yu Chuxin

146
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
as soon as possible.

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,470
I asked you to find out

148
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,270
how Yu Chuxin

149
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,030
managed to seduce Zhou Chuming
six months ago.

150
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
Is there any progress?

151
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,510
It's almost done.

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
When you were expanding
the company to another city,

153
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,640
Mr. Zhou concealed his identity
and came here as an intern.

154
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,150
He was assigned to Yu Chuxin's group.

155
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Then they...

156
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,430
They seemed to

157
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,030
get together naturally.

158
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,880
Are you an idiot?

159
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,790
Get together naturally?

160
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,630
Who'd believe that?

161
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,680
That cunning woman Yu Chuxin

162
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
must have known his identity

163
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,150
and deliberately seduced him.

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,000
Even if she didn't,

165
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,200
we have to make it seem like she did.

166
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Tell those two people

167
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,760
to stop hiding.

168
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,120
They need to help me
finish one last thing,

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,830
then I'll send them abroad.

170
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
(Lin Qingqing)

171
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,360
It was you who

172
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
forced my parents to death.

173
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,830
Zhou Chuming, Zhang Sufang.

174
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,800
I must make you pay with blood.

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,680
Your pawns were removed one by one.

176
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,150
Lin Qingqing,

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,280
you're just a toothless lion.

178
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,200
Why are you still
baring your fangs and claws?

179
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Chuxin, my investigation didn't go well.

180
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,240
The online celebrity Tong Tong

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
disappeared with her boyfriend

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,950
after framing Uncle and Auntie.

183
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
She hasn't even

184
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,800
contacted her family for half a year.

185
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,030
I think

186
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,680
Lin Qingqing ordered her

187
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
to hide somewhere.

188
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,400
Now that we've pushed
Lin Qingqing to this point,

189
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,150
she can't remain completely rational

190
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,320
and will reveal more flaws.

191
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,950
I think

192
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,800
we'll meet Tong Tong very soon.

193
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,030
One more thing.

194
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,990
I found that Lin Qingqing
gave Zhou Yang something.

195
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,560
It seems to be about his parents.

196
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,630
They

197
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,270
seemed to have reached a deal.

198
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,640
Zhou Yang has always suspected

199
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,600
that his parents' suicide

200
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,950
is related to Chuming's parents.

201
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
I need to find

202
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,590
a chance to talk to him

203
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,640
to prevent him from being misled

204
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,390
and making mistakes.

205
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
(Message, Fang)
Chuxin, check the company intranet.

206
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,880
When I was chatting with Yu Chuxin,

207
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,560
I accidentally revealed

208
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,630
Mr. Zhou's real identity,

209
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,920
and she bought me off

210
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,200
and asked me to let Mr. Zhou
be her intern

211
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
so that she could seduce him

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
and become a rich wife.

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,440
She's a cunning woman.
