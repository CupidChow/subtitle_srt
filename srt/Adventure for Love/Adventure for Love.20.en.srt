1
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,610
You've been lying low for years

2
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,460
just to avenge Dongliucheng.

3
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,370
Qin Che told you, didn't he?

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,960
How is he doing?

5
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm sorry for what Ma Yangfei did to your city

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,680
and to your people.

7
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,530
I understand your desire for revenge.

8
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,780
But working with Kanghena

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
is like making a deal with the devil.

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Understand me?

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,960
You haven't watched your family,

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
your people,

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,640
your lover

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,760
die before your eyes.

15
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,210
How could you possibly understand me?

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
You know what?

17
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,079
Qin Che's eyes look just like his.

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,760
Every time I see Qin Che,

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,920
I can still see him coming with betrothal gifts

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,400
on that day.

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,440
But I know

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,720
Qin Che isn't him.

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Because his eyes were always full of light,

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,520
and he always smiled warmly at me.

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll never see him again.

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I can't truly feel what you've felt,

27
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,740
but I do know the taste of losing everything.

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,320
He's gotten what he deserved now.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,660
But you've been in Huiyin City for so many years,

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
can you really bear to watch Kanghena invade it?

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
Create another tragedy?

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,180
What does Huiyin's future have to do with me?

33
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
I've been plotting in the shadows for so many years.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,120
I've been putting on an act in front of him for all these years.

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,920
I am determined to kill him.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,700
I am determined to take back my Dongliu City.

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,200
So you're working with Kang Hena

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,160
because he promised to return Dongliu City to you?

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,720
Yes.

40
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,700
What about Ruofei?

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,720
When the city falls and everything is lost,

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,980
will she stay in Huiyin

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,660
or return to Dongliu with you?

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,460
You specifically asked Kang Hena to let you see Ma Yangfei.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,210
I'm your real target, aren't I?

46
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,360
Unfortunately,

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,640
no matter how eloquent you are,

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
I will never give up my Dongliu City.

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
That's right,

50
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,500
Kang Hena agreed to let me come

51
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,360
because he knows Ma Yangfei has gone mad

52
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
and can't say a word.

53
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
But whether you would appear

54
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
was a gamble I took.

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I bet that you look down on Kang Hena,

56
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,170
and I bet you care about the people of Huiyin City.

57
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,000
Princess.

58
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,170
You should go back and rest now.

59
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,840
Sister, are you sure he'll come?

60
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,450
How would I know?

61
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm not a mind reader.

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,280
He'll come,

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
because you're here.

64
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,880
It's still early, Second Prince.

65
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,360
Come in and eat something first,

66
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,290
or you won't have any energy later.

67
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,480
Useless.

68
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,120
Sister, you have quite an appetite.

69
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
That's the least of my virtues.

70
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
But Kanghe Na,

71
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,920
it's just capturing Qin Che,

72
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
why do we need so many people?

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,160
That's just one of my minor virtues.

74
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,159
I'm always well-prepared.

75
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Besides,

76
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,840
the crowd isn't even that large.

77
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,780
If this were in North Isle,

78
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,280
the arrangement would be much tighter.

79
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
Sister,

80
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,940
why are you asking about this?

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,840
No reason,

82
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
just getting to know you better.

83
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
General Qin,

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
stop struggling.

85
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,780
Everyone down there works for me.

86
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,120
If you had surrendered earlier,

87
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
you might have been spared some suffering.

88
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,160
Princess, are you alright?

89
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
General Qin.

90
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,400
I forgot to tell you,

91
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,940
my sister deliberately wrote to you for help

92
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
just to lure you here for me.

93
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,120
Qin Che.

94
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,800
You approached me deliberately

95
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,640
to take revenge on my father,

96
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,280
and you manipulated my feelings.

97
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
If it weren't for Kang Hena,

98
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
I wouldn't have seen your true colors.

99
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,040
So from today onwards,

100
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,000
I, Ma Qianqiu, am severing all ties with you.

101
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,040
This is mine.

102
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,380
I'm cutting ties with you.

103
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
From now on,

104
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,260
we have nothing to do with each other.

105
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,160
Ma Qianqiu.

106
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,100
You're in such a hurry to distance yourself from me.

107
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
You never trusted me.

108
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,540
If that's the case,

109
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,580
I have nothing more to ask.

110
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,810
I'll just assume I was fooling myself.

111
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,760
Kang Hena.

112
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,610
I'm begging you,

113
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
please let him go.

114
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,700
I promise to marry you.

115
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,080
Sister.

116
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,410
We were meant to be married anyway.

117
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,250
Don't worry.

118
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Once we deal with him,

119
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,780
we'll definitely be happy together.

120
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,290
Fire the arrows!

121
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,480
Qin Che!

122
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,240
Sister.

123
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Qin Che.

124
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,480
Qin Che.

125
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm warning you,

126
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
don't hurt my sister.

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,860
Tell your men outside to back off.

128
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,560
Hurry up.

129
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,850
Or I'll kill her.

130
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Now!

131
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,400
Kang Hena, aren't you going to withdraw your men?

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,730
Do you want to see me die?

133
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,920
Withdraw.

134
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,960
Sister.

135
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,040
Qin Che!

136
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,560
Run!

137
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Qin Che!

138
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
Qianqiu!

139
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,720
Qin Che!

140
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
Are you okay?

141
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm fine.

142
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,520
What's wrong?

143
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,560
Qin Che!

144
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,600
Qin Che!

145
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,170
What happened, Qin Che?

146
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,760
Qin Che

147
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,080
Qin Che

148
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,560
Qin Che

149
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,880
Hello? Hello?

150
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,640
Number 0598, can you hear me?

151
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,920
What's that sound? Who are you?

152
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,200
Good, good.

153
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Number 0598.

154
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,920
We're from the Piao Piao Management Bureau.

155
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,760
Your memories have temporarily disappeared

156
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,000
due to our operational error.

157
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,520
But we've fixed the issue now,

158
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,720
and you'll recover your memories soon.

159
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
What management bureau?

160
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,010
What will happen after I recover my memories?

161
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Well, it's like this.

162
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,540
When you recover your mem-

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Hello? Hello?

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,860
Can you hear me?

165
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,520
What memories?

166
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,660
What memories?

167
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Explain clearly.

168
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,980
Sister, you're awake.

169
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,210
Where is Qin Che?

170
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Did you catch him?

171
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,520
No.

172
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,080
But he was hit by an arrow.

173
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,100
Our men coated the arrow with poison,

174
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,250
even if he escapes, the poison will take effect soon.

175
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,800
How is it?

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
The arrow wound itself isn't fatal.

177
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,920
I've treated the General's wound.

178
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,120
But the problem is

179
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,930
What is it? Tell me quickly!

180
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,160
The arrowhead was poisoned.

181
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,000
I've never seen this poison before,

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,840
and I don't know how to neutralize it.

183
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
Xinjiang Dican

184
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,700
Xinjiang Di

186
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
Lei Cai Long Yan Peng Song Hui

187

188
