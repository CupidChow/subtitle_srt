1
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,200
Qianqiu,

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
what brings you here?

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,330
It's about Ping'er.

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,200
This time Ping'er has done something unbelievable,

5
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,860
which has broken my heart.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,640
However, despite my sadness,

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,700
I've conducted some investigation.

8
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,320
As luck would have it,

9
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,170
I managed to find several elderly people from the palace

10
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,160
and learned about

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,960
some hidden truths regarding Brother Che's mother from those days.

12
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,200
General Qin's mother?

13
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,400
Father,

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
crimes deserve punishment,

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,729
and injustices should be resolved. Don't you agree?

16
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,280
That makes sense.

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,920
Che's mother

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,759
was accused of stealing the city lord's wife's jade hairpin

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,440
and was banished from the palace.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
Father, do you know about this?

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
But the only evidence

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
was that on the night the hairpin went missing,

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Lady Meng was on duty,

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,919
so they pinned the blame on her.

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,560
But yesterday, while chatting with Sister Ruofei,

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,620
I discovered something suspicious about this matter.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,180
It's still moving.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
Ma Qianqiu, can you handle this or not?

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Why is it taking so long to fix?

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
Don't worry, I've had professional training.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,500
Hold still.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,680
Done.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Let me see.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,680
How is it? Pretty good, right?

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,660
Your skills aren't that impressive.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,320
Now can you tell me?

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,440
What happened to the City Lord's wife's

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
jade and glass phoenix hairpin?

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
Perhaps it was stolen by a palace maid

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
and ended up somewhere among common people.

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
Father was absolutely furious

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,040
at that time.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
Everyone involved

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,780
was expelled from the palace.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Xiao Liu, bring the person in.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,820
Greetings, City Lord.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,079
This is.

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,020
I once served in the royal city

49
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,079
and accidentally saw a maid

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,400
who accidentally broke the city lord's wife's jade hairpin

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
and fearing punishment,

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,800
she took the broken hairpin

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
and secretly buried it in the garden.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,520
The incident caused such an uproar at the time,

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560
but I was too cowardly to report it.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,930
Please forgive me, my lord.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,770
Are you referring to the person in this painting?

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
Although many years have passed,

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
I still remember

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,360
that the maid had a mole on her face,

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,820
definitely not the person in this portrait.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Father.

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,320
Now someone can prove

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,200
that Che's mother was not a thief,

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,279
so can we clear her name?

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,400
I believe Father was deceived back then.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
The City Lord is kind and virtuous,

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,140
surely you won't let good people be wronged, right?

69
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,840
Very well.

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Qin Che will soon become part of our family.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,400
Some things need to be clarified.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,400
Now that

73
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,080
this has been determined to be a wrongful accusation,

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,360
I will

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,890
certainly give you a proper explanation.

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,260
Thank you, Father.

77
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
Thank you, Princess.

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Thank you, City Lord.

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,000
His mother's name has been cleared,

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
why does he show no reaction?

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,080
How was it?

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,880
Not bad.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
I told Ma Qianqiu everything.

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Of course,

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
exactly as you taught me, word for word.

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,280
As expected of my daughter,

87
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
so clever.

88
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,040
Now some must be celebrating while others are worried.

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,400
Ma Qianqiu.

90
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,200
Qin Che.

91
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Governor.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,720
Governor,

93
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,650
terrible news! It's terrible!

94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,680
What is it now?

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,800
The scandal about embezzling flood relief funds

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,400
has blown up.

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,400
People are gathering outside the government office

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,130
demanding an explanation.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
And also,

100
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
the envoy from North Isle

101
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
claims they're coming to investigate Liuyue's death.

102
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,520
Then suppress it!

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Ma Qianqiu.

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
Expose all of Ma Qianqiu's scandals,

105
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,940
every last one of them.

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
Bunch of useless fools.

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,560
I've already told them everything,

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
but the people

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,960
aren't interested at all.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Ma Qianqiu.

111
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't forget,

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
besides you,

113
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,760
I have another daughter.

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Princess, this is...

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,160
General Qin, let's make a deal,

116
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,140
what do you say?

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,920
Do you see that child?

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,370
Don't you think she looks like you?

119
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020
What are you trying to say?

120
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,100
Ping'er's husband died on the battlefield,

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,320
but she and her child never received proper compensation.

122
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,040
So,

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,720
she had to leave her child with her brother,

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,840
relying on a meager allowance

125
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,570
to ask him to care for the child.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,280
Tell me,

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,480
would her child blame Ping'er

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,840
for not being able to stay by her side all the time,

129
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,170
to love and protect her?

130
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,010
General Qin.

131
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
Let's make a deal.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,720
What is it?

133
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,409
You secretly help me save Ping'er,

134
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,679
and I'll help clear your mother's name.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,960
I've already announced Ping'er's sentence to the entire city,

136
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
there's nothing I can do.

137
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,220
You definitely have a way.

138
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
It just depends on

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,520
whether you're willing to save

140
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,360
another Qin Che in this world.

141
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,200
Here.

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Princess.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,480
I can never repay

144
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,860
your kindness to Ping'er, Princess.

145
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,480
If you want to thank someone, thank General Qin.

146
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,360
If not for his clever deception,

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you would have been in real trouble.

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,890
Thank you, General Qin.

149
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,180
I have some silver here

150
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,200
Take it,

151
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,300
and live well with your child.

152
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
Don't ever return to Huiyin City.

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Princess, I cannot accept this.

154
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
Just live a good life,

155
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,200
now go.

156
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,320
Who was executed in Ping'er's place?

157
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,490
I don't know,

158
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
probably some condemned prisoner's body.

159
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,040
You should go back with the carriage first,

160
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,770
I want to walk alone for a while.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,520
Wait,

162
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
I have something for you.

163
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,380
I don't know

164
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,970
if this will bring back unpleasant memories,

165
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,650
but I still want to give it to you

166
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,650
to do with as you please.

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
No one believes me.

168
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,080
No one.

169
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,800
Mother, please eat something.

170
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,690
It's all because of you.

171
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
If I hadn't gotten pregnant with you,

172
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,920
I wouldn't be like this now.

173
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,000
If you didn't exist,

174
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
everything would be better.

175
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
You can throw it away,

176
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,440
to release your resentment.

177
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,080
Or you can keep it,

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,880
to remember your mother.

179
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
Either way,

180
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,220
I hope you can let go of the knot in your heart.

181
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,440
Qin Che.

182
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,090
Your mother must have been heartbroken then.

183
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,770
I suppose so.

184
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,200
I think

185
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,080
if she knew

186
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,940
that you've cleared her name now,

187
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,720
she would be so happy.

188
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,160
She would surely stroke your head and say,

189
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,220
you're wonderful.

190
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
