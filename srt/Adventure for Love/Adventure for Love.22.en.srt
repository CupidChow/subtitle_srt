1
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,009
Get inside! Get inside!

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,039
Hurry up!

3
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,000
Move it!

4
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,200
What's going on here?

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Quickly! Get inside!

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,259
Stop looking! Go back!

7
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,240
Don't cause trouble!

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,360
What are you all doing?

9
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,920
Previously, Mr. Chen was following

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,880
Princess Qianqiu's love affairs

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
when his reporting was suddenly shut down.

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,200
Now with Princess Qianqiu's wedding,

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
they won't even let us near the entrance.

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Has something major happened in the royal city?

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,840
I... I don't know about this.

16
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,480
Isn't it true that

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,200
Mr. Chen has the best information?

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,040
Mr. Chen.

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,500
Alright, alright.

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,320
I don't have any special powers.

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,960
What do you mean?

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
We paid you so much money,

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,120
are you just going to abandon us now?

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,040
Exactly!

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,600
How can you do this?

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
I...

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm just someone who takes money

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
and follows orders.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Whatever news they want me to report,

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
that's what I report, right?

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
What do you mean 'right'? Refund!

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,800
Refund! Refund! Refund!

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Refund! Refund! Refund!

34
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Gentlemen use words, not fists!

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Refund! Refund! Refund!

36
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,440
Shouldn't you be going now,

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,480
or you'll be late?

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,610
Let me stay a bit longer.

39
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,490
Xiao Liu is keeping watch outside.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,440
Qin Che,

41
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,040
I think I know what your heart is saying.

42
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240
It's saying

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,420
it loves me.

44
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,209
After we deal with Kang Hena today,

45
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,079
and once everything is settled,

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,140
we'll leave this place

47
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,640
and go somewhere where nobody knows us,

48
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,180
live like we did before in that cabin,

49
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,500
what do you say?

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
Princess, it's almost time.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,920
I know.

52
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,700
Your silence means

53
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,000
you agree.

54
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's go.

55
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,080
Sister.

56
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,760
Lord Mayor, Lady Mayor.

57
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
The auspicious time has arrived,

58
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
let's begin.

59
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
The Lord Mayor is gravely ill today and cannot speak,

60
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
so I will speak on his behalf.

61
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Qianqiu.

62
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,300
Your engagement to the Second Prince

63
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,800
is a match made in heaven.

64
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,960
You are connecting Huiyin and Beiyu.

65
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,520
Always remember

66
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,640
that you bear the responsibility of both cities,

67
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
do not fail this duty.

68
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,140
Drink this cup of wine,

69
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,610
and the ceremony will be complete.

70
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Sister.

71
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,440
Who's there? Seize them!

72
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
Qin Che.

73
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,920
Who sent you?

74
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,520
Was it Qin Che?

75
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,580
Second Prince.

76
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
It's been a while.

77
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,720
Run!

78
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,160
Ruofei!

79
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,640
Mother.

80
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
Qin Che,

81
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,570
you're alive after all.

82
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,040
Qin Che.

83
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,000
As long as you're standing here,

84
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
how could I possibly die?

85
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,320
Qin Che.

86
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
Princess.

87
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,100
After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me?

88
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,690
You've done nothing for me.

89
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,480
You just wanted to use me to become Huiyin's consort.

90
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
So you could openly control our Huiyin.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
And then take Huiyin

92
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,340
back to your North Isle Lord to claim credit.

93
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,120
Ma Qianqiu.

94
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,680
Seems you're not as stupid as I thought.

95
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,640
What are you staring at? Hurry up and save me.

96
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,100
Don't you want your land in Dongliu anymore?

97
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
Qin Che.

98
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Is this what you were talking about?

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,250
How did you get this?

100
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
The land cession document for Donglu City.

101
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,130
Qin Che, what are you doing?

102
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,900
It doesn't even have Huiyin City's seal,

103
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,900
what kind of document is this?

104
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
Back then, Ma Yangfei and the Lord of Beiyu

105
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
secretly traded Donglu,

106
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,040
it was a shady deal to begin with,

107
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,920
they were afraid of being exposed,

108
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,280
why would they leave a document as evidence?

109
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,210
If they really wanted Donglu back,

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
then the Lord of Beiyu

111
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,170
should have traded his beloved second prince for it.

112
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,330
General Qin,

113
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,810
how should we deal with him now?

114
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Do you really think you can capture me?

115
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
General Qin, it's bad!

116
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,640
Beiyu's army has broken through the north gate,

117
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,570
they'll reach the royal city soon.

118
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
What?

119
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,520
Did you think I would enter Huiyin

120
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,520
without being absolutely certain of success?

121
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,260
I didn't expect you to have so many backup plans.

122
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,520
Fortunately, I already sent people

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
to secure the south gate.

124
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm afraid that's just a drop in the bucket.

125
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
I've positioned Beiyu forces

126
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,000
outside every city gate,

127
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
just waiting for my command.

128
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,840
You tricked me!

129
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,960
Fine.

130
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Qin Che,

131
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,160
Ma Qianqiu,

132
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,020
I won't let you get away with this.

133
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,120
You bastard,

134
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,060
can't you speak properly?

135
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,620
Always calling me sister,

136
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
so annoying.

137
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,320
No need to hide anymore,

138
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,980
everything is back to normal.

139
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Recently,

140
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,360
Prince Kang Hena, the second prince of Beiyu, came to Huiyin

141
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,960
intending to seize the city.

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,760
Fortunately, the Princess and General Qin Che made timely arrangements

143
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,680
saving Huiyin from war.

144
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,720
Kang Hena has now been detained

145
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,880
pending negotiations with the Lord of Beiyu regarding compensation.

146
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
For future developments,

147
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,240
the Princess will keep everyone informed in a timely manner.

148
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,480
The Princess has already drafted a statement

149
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,610
to explain the situation to everyone.

150
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

151
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,480
as the Princess of Huiyin,

152
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
it is my duty to protect Huiyin,

153
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,090
and I must remember my mission.

154
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
However, life is full of hardships,

155
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
and everyone's life is already difficult enough.

156
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
We should cherish the present

157
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
and not waste time on meaningless matters.

158
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,040
Xinjiang.

159
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:29,920
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

160
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,400
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

161
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,840
Bojun.

162
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,640
Bojun.

163
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,120
Zhuangcheng.

164
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,920
Zhuangcheng.

165
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,000
Jinsheng.

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Jinsheng.

167
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
Danwei, Pingling.

168
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,420
Danwei, Pingling.

169
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,340
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

170
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,680
Ni.

171
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,000
Yue.

172
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,690
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

173
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,680
Luling.
