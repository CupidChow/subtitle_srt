1
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,160
Really?

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,400
Princess, have you two reconciled?

3
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,420
Have a seat.

4
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
There's an issue now,

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,050
everyone already knows

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
that I'm about to compete with Ma Ruofei

7
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
for the Divine Maiden position.

8
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,780
I didn't know that.

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Well, now you do.

10
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,360
Come here.

11
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,240
But I...

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,200
I...

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,580
I don't know what we're competing in.

14
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,080
Dancing, of course!

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Princess,

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
you're the most beautiful dancer

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
in all of Huiyin.

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Really?

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
Yes, truly,

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,680
your dancing is so graceful and elegant.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,260
Stop the flattery.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,900
Didn't you say it was a partner dance?

23
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
Are you tired?

24
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Of course not.

25
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm in the center position,

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
so I have to give it my all.

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Then why are you breathing so hard?

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,700
Never mind.

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,920
Princess, what kind of dance is this?

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
This is Produce Camp.

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,460
Whatever it is,

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,720
just tell me if it's cool

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,250
and if it can beat Ma Ruofei?

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,920
It can.

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
If I step in, it'll definitely work.

36
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,690
Since you're already here,

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,290
why don't you dance with me?

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
I'll pass.

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,520
You dancing alone is enough.

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,680
Fine.

41
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,300
Too bad you're busy tomorrow.

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,079
Otherwise,

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,500
you could have seen my gorgeous dancing.

44
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,410
Didn't I just see it?

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Gorgeous indeed.

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,320
Of course.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Although your competition with Ma Ruofei

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,660
is getting a lot of attention,

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,360
win or lose,

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
Ma Yangfei will definitely use you again.

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,200
You.

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,160
Don't worry.

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
Whether I compete or not,

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,890
he won't let me off the hook.

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,800
I've been avoiding trouble for so long anyway.

56
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,160
It's about time I came out to save the world.

57
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,800
Weren't we supposed to have a competition here?

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,130
Are you messing with me?

59
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
Am I on some reality show?

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,580
Where is everyone?

61
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,560
No one is coming anymore.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,280
City Lord,

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,970
what does this mean?

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Ma Qianqiu failed to arrive at the competition venue on time,

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,850
which is considered a forfeit.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,650
Congratulations to Ruofei for becoming this year's Lantern Goddess.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Why don't we wait a little longer?

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
The news has already spread,

69
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
if we don't compete,

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
people will say Ruofei's victory wasn't fair.

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,720
No need.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,770
Ma Qianqiu doesn't take the competition seriously.

73
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
No one will blame

74
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,520
our hardworking and dedicated Ruofei.

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,180
I will never allow Ruofei to be thrown under the bus.

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,160
Prepare well

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
Ma Qianqiu,

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,120
and stun everyone.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
where on earth have you gone?

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
My dancing skills are first-class.

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,000
Good.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
Where are we?

83
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's not wait anymore,

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,159
let's go back.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,730
Where are you going?

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,860
Back to the royal city.

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,520
Someone must be afraid I'll beat Ma Ruofei

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,640
and ruin their plans,

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
so they lured me here.

90
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
We need to hurry back now,

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,080
we might still make it in time for the competition.

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,340
Let's go. Lead the way.

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,400
This way.

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
No, that's wrong.

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,040
I think it's this way.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
That's not right either.

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,640
Xiao Liu.

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,260
So you have no sense of direction.

99
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,720
How did we get here?

100
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Can't we just go back the same way?

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,520
We came here by carriage.

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,080
Well...

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Princess,

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,280
are you lost too?

105
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,520
Who says so?

106
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,400
I...

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
I...

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
This way, follow me.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,320
Princess.

110
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,220
Why does it feel like we're back at this place again?

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,240
Yes.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
I can't go on anymore.

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I'm too tired. I'm not walking any further.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Princess, why don't you sit here for a while,

115
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,660
I'll go get you some water.

116
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Princess.

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
Princess.

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Princess.

119
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,680
Princess.

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,330
Fang Jue.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
Are there any who haven't been caught?

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,100
General, there are still two.

123
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
These Northern Isle soldiers have been restless lately,

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,140
always trying to probe about your identity.

125
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Should we...?

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,560
No need.

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,560
The Northern Isle people look different from us,

128
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,620
keeping them alive

129
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,720
makes it easier for us to enter and exit the Northern Isle.

130
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,850
We just need to train our soldiers well

131
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,820
and take good care of them.

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,409
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,080
Sir,

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
the princess is missing.

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,280
Wasn't she supposed to compete with Ma Ruofei today?

136
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
How could she be missing?

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,970
Where is the competition site?

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,370
By the Hao River,

139
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,640
which is indeed the direction those Northern Isle soldiers fled.

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,170
General.

141
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,409
Leave no survivors.

142
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,400
Brother, is she Ma Qianqiu?

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,780
That's her.

144
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
Great!

145
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
Once we hand her over to that person,

146
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,810
we can return to North Isle.

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,040
However.

148
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
What if that person

149
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,640
goes back on his word?

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
What then?

151
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,440
She's a princess after all,

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,680
someone will pay for her.

153
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,400
Besides,

154
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,160
I haven't seen my wife and kids for ages.

155
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,490
You're right, brother.

156
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,800
My eyes!

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Brother,

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,160
help me!

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,330
Where do you think you're running!

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,600
Sister.

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,160
Sister,

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,050
are you alright?

163
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,100
No, I'm not.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,130
They want to kill me,

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,060
please save me!

166
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,760
Sister,

167
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,210
what follows will be quite bloody,

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,570
you'd better not watch.

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,540
Another tough character.

170
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,640
Have I just escaped the tiger's den

171
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,300
only to enter the wolf's lair?

172
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
Where did this brat come from?

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,050
Beat it if you know what's good for you!

174
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,640
Thanks for your help,

175
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,540
but we won't be meeting again.

176
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Interesting.

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,160
This horse is too wild,

178
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
threw me right off

179
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
and nearly killed me.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,330
The horse has returned.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,040
Qin Che.

182
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,160
Xiaolu, it's like this,

183
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,000
in a moment we're going to shoot

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
an elevated shot of you,

185
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
you need to be mindful of your facial expressions,

186
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,930
understand?

187
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Keep the same emotional state as the previous scene, okay?

188
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,290
If you're ready,

189
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,820
we'll start shooting now.

190
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,770
Alright.

191
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,970
Is this the lousy marketing plan you came up with?

192
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,840
Do it if you can, leave if you can't.

193
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
Copying someone else's template,

194
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,440
plagiarizing someone else's content,

195
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,600
are you trying to fool me?

196
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
Where are your own ideas?

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
What? What?

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,100
Aren't I the princess?

199
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,100
That makes no sense at all.

200
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,880
What princess?

201
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
With your status,

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,860
you're only fit to be a concubine to our lord.

203
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,240
If you want to climb the social ladder,

204
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
you need wings long enough to reach.

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm not... I'm not...

206
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Who am I?

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,520
Who am I?

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
Who am I really?

209
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,040
Princess,

210
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,890
don't be afraid,

211
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm here.

212
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Qin Che,

213
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,560
I thought I'd never see you again.

214
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,040
There, there,

215
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,880
don't cry,

216
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,680
don't cry.

217
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,240
Don't cry.

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,680
Xinjiang, Di, Can.

219
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,410
Xinjiang Di.

220
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,360
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

221
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,760
Bo Jun.

222
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,040
Zhuang Cheng.

223
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,760
Jin Sheng.

224
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Jin Sheng.

225
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

226
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,780
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

227
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,480
Ni.

228
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,480
Yue.

229
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

230
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,130
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

231
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,840
Lu Ling.

232
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,160
Lu Ling.
