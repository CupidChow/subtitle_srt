1
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,240
I didn't even notice.

2
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,500
That was really dangerous and shocking.

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,250
Did you see that?

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,400
That person went completely crazy

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,259
just because of something I said.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
Was I really wrong

7
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
to agree to marry you?

8
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,140
You think it's your fault?

9
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,760
I don't know.

10
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,140
I just don't want to die for no reason,

11
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,290
or be married off to North Isle.

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,120
If I hadn't come here,

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,180
none of this would have happened.

14
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,570
Whether you came or not,

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,800
you couldn't stop their gossip.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,370
Their speculation.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Their fantasies.

18
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,940
And their attacks.

19
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
You're right.

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,220
Maybe this is my mission for coming here.

21
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,280
Mission.

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,250
Why did I suddenly say that?

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Mission?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,530
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Nothing.

26
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,760
Qin Che,

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,960
can you tell me now?

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Why did you want to kill me before,

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
but now you don't?

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,480
You haven't actually fallen for me, have you?

31
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
The woman, Yu, was born with great beauty.

32
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,380
Everyone adored her from childhood.

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,240
Her father saw that

34
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
she was three,

35
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,010
and had Yu learn singing, dancing, and painting.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,890
He publicly claimed

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,460
that Yu was the reincarnation of a heavenly auspicious cloud.

38
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Little did people know her father was already obsessed with wealth,

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,959
creating hype to collect money,

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,839
and hiding the truth.

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,860
Do you understand?

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,280
What?

43
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,160
You bought a rumor-debunking book too?

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,580
Recently, Beixia Village suffered a disaster.

45
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
The petition for aid was submitted,

46
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
and the royal city already sent people to help.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
But the villagers of Beixia

48
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
are still homeless.

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Did the appointed officials pocket the money?

50
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,330
Very clever.

51
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,920
Recently in Huiyin City,

52
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,180
everyone's talking about our marriage.

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,159
Nobody even knows

54
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,640
that some areas are suffering from disasters.

55
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,240
By shifting attention to us,

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,640
naturally no one will question what's happening.

57
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,480
This kind of thing has happened

58
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,280
more than once or twice already.

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
I heard from Xiaoliu that

60
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
the reason I'm so welcomed by Huiyin's people,

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,360
besides my beauty and status as a princess,

62
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,260
more importantly,

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,800
Ma Yangfei announced to everyone

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,360
that I'm a reincarnation from a hundred years ago,

65
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,560
a divine woman protecting Huiyin City.

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,970
So Ma Yangfei has been using me to mislead the people.

67
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
You want to kill me

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,860
and break the people's faith?

69
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Yes and no.

70
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,740
Striking down Ma Yangfei's power

71
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,560
is merely the first step.

72
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
is just the beginning.

73
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Feng Chun Zui.

74
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,920
Someone died in front of me today.

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
It's all because of me

76
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,880
that their grievances will be suppressed.

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,600
It will be over soon.

78
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,080
In a month,

79
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,409
Ma Yangfei will hold a blessing ceremony.

80
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,220
I'll lead my people to attack.

81
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,720
What if during the ceremony,

82
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
the Goddess dies?

83
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,420
Wouldn't everything go more smoothly then?

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
As the Goddess,

85
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,120
beloved by the people,

86
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,380
I've ignored their suffering

87
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,290
and been forced by Ma Yangfei to deceive them.

88
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,160
If my death

89
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,380
can wake the people from their illusions

90
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,900
and bring the tyrannical Ma Yangfei to justice,

91
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,160
then it will all be worth it.

92
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
The Goddess loves humanity.

93
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,220
So her suicide isn't just about being lovesick.

94
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,520
But isn't that too naive?

95
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Of course, the spirit is noble.

96
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
But you're all

97
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
underestimating Ma Yangfei too much.

98
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,280
This guy spouts nonsense every day

99
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
and has everyone fooled.

100
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,080
But is the goddess really what matters?

101
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,600
Of course not.

102
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,640
If this goddess dies,

103
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,800
there will be Ma Ruofei,

104
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,800
or some Ma Fangfang,

105
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Ma Yuanyuan, or whoever.

106
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,960
If you want to defeat Ma Yangfei's forces,

107
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,400
you must take control,

108
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,280
make him lose control

109
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,290
and fall into disarray.

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,770
You've really changed.

111
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,210
You have a point.

112
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Of course,

113
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,840
so don't think about killing me anymore.

114
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,290
I was just bluffing,

115
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,100
and you actually believed it.

116
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

117
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,250
Princess, would you be willing

118
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,920
to join me in a great endeavor

119
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,210
to restore peace to Huiyin?

120
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,880
Wait,

121
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,810
don't tell me you arranged today's events

122
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,280
just to drag me into this.

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Go ahead.

124
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,520
Thank you.

125
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,300
Let's go eat first.

126
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,680
Qin Che is too cunning.

127
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
No matter how deep one's schemes are,

128
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,460
they're all transparent before you, Princess.

129
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,280
I've laid everything out for you.

130
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,380
Will you still refuse?

131
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,650
What should I do?

132
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,250
I seem unable to refuse him.

133
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Let me think about

134
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,720
how to guide them all onto the right path.

135
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,170
Go ahead and eat.

136
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,940
Princess, we've arrived at the General's mansion.

137
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,490
Aren't I supposed to be a princess?

138
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,560
Why am I living like a 007?

139
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,520
Princess, what does 007 mean?

140
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
007 means

141
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,040
going to work with a happy heart.

142
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Princess, you've really changed a lot.

143
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,360
You used to always prepare for the worst.

144
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,280
But ever since the blessing ceremony,

145
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
you've become like a different person,

146
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,890
much more cheerful.

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
The ladies all say the skies have cleared,

148
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,920
and the clouds in your destiny have dispersed.

149
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Of course,

150
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,620
there were always two people, Princess.

151
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,680
I didn't know you were coming,

152
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,800
please forgive me for not greeting you properly.

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
What brings you here?

154
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm here to celebrate your general's birthday.

155
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Brother Che,

156
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,400
your little sister Qianqiu is here.

157
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,480
Look, look at this.

158
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,000
Brother Che.

159
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,240
Brother Che.

160
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Princess, why are you here?

161
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,680
Xiao Liu,

162
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,940
retreat immediately.

163
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,640
The second quarter planning meeting

164
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,500
for the major operation officially begins.

165
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,170
What do you mean?

166
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,600
I've been thinking carefully,

167
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,130
with so many mouths around,

168
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,700
I can't possibly silence them all one by one.

169
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,880
Didn't you want to guide them

170
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,820
one by one onto the right path?

171
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Easier said

172
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,000
than done.

173
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,160
But we can fight magic with magic.

174
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,490
Xin, Jiang, Di, Can.

175
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

176
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,100
Bo, Jun.

177
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,360
Zhuang, Cheng.

178
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,220
Zhuang, Cheng.

179
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Jin, Sheng.

180
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,900
Jin, Sheng.

181
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,600
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

182
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

183
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,540
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

184
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:58,920
Ni.

185
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,690
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

186
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,920
Lu Ling.
