1
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,760
You're not Ma Qianqiu.

2
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,920
Who are you?

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,880
Me?

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Lunatic.

5
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Of course I'm Ma Qianqiu.

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,479
I just

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
lost my memory.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Don't lie.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
And don't think about running away.

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't like feeling out of control.

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,440
Princess Qianqiu, we've come to see you!

12
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Quiet!

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Everyone, please quiet down!

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Goddess Meet and Greet will now officially begin.

15
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,880
I'll take care of it.

16
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
This is yours.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
Please line up over here.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Thank you.

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
I want one.

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,810
Here, this is yours.

21
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Here.

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,210
General,

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,320
are we really going to follow your wife's advice

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
not to kill the princess

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,320
and send her for a political marriage instead?

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,050
They just won't leave me alone.

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
Mu Wan is nothing.

28
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,400
I've just found a new use for Ma Qianqiu.

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,940
The General has a new plan.

30
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,780
Think about it carefully,

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,680
can the marriage escort team enter North Isle?

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
I see now,

33
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,440
this way you can kill the Lord of North Isle yourself.

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,120
The heads of Ma Yangfei and the Lord of North Isle,

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,250
I will take them both with my own hands.

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Go get a portrait.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Xiao Liu, come give me a massage.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,650
Being a goddess is too exhausting.

39
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Qianqiu is back.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,770
Why are you here?

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Exhausted, aren't you?

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
Here, let me rub your shoulders.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
No, no, no,

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm scared.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
Just tell me what's going on.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,960
Good news.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,840
Look at this,

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
what do you think of this man?

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,740
How handsome he is!

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
He's alright.

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,610
How about marrying him?

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,240
Madam.

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,360
Mother, are you joking?

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,740
Why are you suddenly so eager to marry me off?

55
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, it's because

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
North Isle is discussing a marriage alliance.

57
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,140
And I immediately thought of you.

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
The lord of North Isle

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
is charming and strong.

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,000
And North Isle has such a comfortable climate.

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,820
It's absolutely delightful.

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Such a good opportunity and you thought of me?

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,300
What about your daughter?

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,100
Isn't Ruofei still too young?

65
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,159
Besides,

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,600
I really don't want her to marry too far away either.

67
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,000
So I can get married then?

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,440
You're different.

69
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,800
If you marry into North Isle,

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,120
you won't have to deal with those goddess ceremonies

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
that they make you attend every day,

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,840
which is so annoying.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,920
Muwan has a point.

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,520
I now have to be careful of Qin Che

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,520
and deal with Ma Yangfei.

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,290
I might as well run far away,

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
and hopefully escape during the marriage journey.

78
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Qianqiu.

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
Have you made your decision?

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,920
I...

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
I...

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,400
I accept.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,720
Wonderful!

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,760
That's great,

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,400
but...

86
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You owe me a favor.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Of course.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Absolutely.

89
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,240
I'll go tell the city lord right away.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
That's great.

91
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,970
Madam, please go ahead.

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,159
You.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,610
What's going on?

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,159
Wonderful, wonderful.

95
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,800
Take care.

96
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,520
Xiaoliu, Princess.

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,580
Don't you think he looks like Qin Che?

98
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,930
It seems to have worked.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,840
The city lord is actually willing to give the goddess to Beiyu

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,850
to a scoundrel like Ma Yangfei.

101
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,000
As long as the price is right,

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,480
he'll sell anything.

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
Liu Yue?

104
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,280
How can it be him?

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,220
You know him, General?

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I've dealt with him before in Beiyu.

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,210
It seems this marriage alliance won't be so easy.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,160
You may go.

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,850
How does that saying go?

110
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land,

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,220
what a pleasant surprise.

112
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,300
Wouldn't you agree, General Qin?

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
Lord Liu Yue, if you keep speaking in riddles,

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,420
it gets rather boring.

115
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,040
A wandering merchant trading for military supplies in Beiyu,

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,120
suddenly transformed into the great general of Huiyin City.

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I wonder, General Qin,

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,200
what was the purpose of acquiring those weapons?

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,060
Does the City Lord of Huiyin know?

120
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,280
Lord Liu Yue, you've traveled so far to our Huiyin,

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,920
is it really just for the marriage alliance?

122
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Perhaps you have other intentions?

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
The mighty City Lord of Huiyin

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,960
is willing to sell his daughter for a thousand gold pieces,

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,120
proving money can make even the devil turn the millstone.

126
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,180
Naturally, I'm hoping for such an opportunity as well.

127
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,880
300 gold.

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Dealing with a clever person

129
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
is truly delightful.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,480
When the princess departs for Beiyu,

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
please escort her safely, General.

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
I'll be waiting in Beiyu City,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,620
looking forward to sharing a drink with you.

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,930
Rest assured, Lord Liu Yue.

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Demon,

136
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
haunting me still.

137
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you, City Lord of Huiyin,

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
for painfully agreeing to give Princess Qianqiu

139
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
in marriage to our Lord of Beiyu.

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,580
Allow me, Liu Yue, to toast you on behalf of our lord.

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,880
Having the honor to meet Princess Qianqiu,

142
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,610
she truly is a heavenly beauty.

143
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,039
I will diligently prepare for the marriage alliance.

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Cheers.

145
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,380
Cheers.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,960
In a short while,

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
it will be our lord's 60th birthday,

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,960
truly a double celebration.

149
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,610
What did you say?

150
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,600
Sixty?

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,880
Wasn't the portrait you showed me of a man in his twenties?

152
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,890
That was indeed the Lord of Beiyu himself.

153
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
Age has only made him stronger.

154
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,780
Age cannot wither him.

155
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
Princess Qianqiu mentioned

156
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,600
it must be our city lord's portrait from his youth,

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
which was indeed quite dashing.

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,360
Dashing? Please,

159
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,490
he's already sixty.

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
So this is all about preventing

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
his daughter from being married off,

162
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
trying to fool me.

163
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,680
Father,

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
I refuse to marry.

165
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,730
What are you saying?

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,200
This isn't something you can just change as you please,

167
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
sit down.

168
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
Sit down,

169
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
fine.

170
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,120
So you all want me to get married?

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
Then I'll go all out.

172
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,760
Ancestors of Huiyin,

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,440
grant me your strength.

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,740
Ma Qianqiu,

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,080
what are you doing now?

176
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Get up.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Father, don't ask me,

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,840
ask what heaven's will means.

179
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
They say

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I've been appointed as a divine maiden,

181
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
meant to protect this land

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
and those I love.

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,530
General Qin,

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
quickly take the princess away.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Take her away.

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,760
Perhaps I should come back another day.

187
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,840
Fine, fine.

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
What I mean is

189
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,280
the envoy is welcome to visit Huiyin another day

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,520
please excuse me for not seeing you out.

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,400
When the princess changes her mind

192
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,240
I will return with all these treasures

193
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,170
to Huiyin again.

194
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,240
Until next time.

195
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait.

196
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
Why is the Liuyue envoy in such a hurry?

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,280
Indeed.

198
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
If you wait a few more days

199
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,840
the goddess might change her mind

200
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,120
and the marriage alliance could still proceed.

201
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,920
Father

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
if I really married him

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,580
could you actually bring yourself to call him son-in-law?

204
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,880
With some effort, I could manage it.

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
Yes, Qianqiu.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,570
Just consider it as goodwill between our two cities.

207
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
On your wedding day,

208
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,280
I will personally help you with your makeup

209
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,210
and see you off in the bridal sedan.

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,650
Why don't you just remarry yourself, Mother?

211
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
I think you and the Lord of North Isle City

212
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,970
would make a much better match.

213
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
If you're willing

214
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
to sacrifice your happiness for our marriage,

215
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,840
the court historians will surely sing your praises.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,260
You ungrateful child!

217
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,480
My Lord, look at her.

218
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,920
I think Mother is fierce and domineering,

219
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
and quite the bully at home,

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,040
a perfect match for my father indeed.

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
You!

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,840
Come on, hit me!

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
Guards! Guards!

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Murder!

225
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
Guards!

226
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
Arrest her immediately!

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,280
Finally escaped from that den of lions.

228
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,380
Princess Qianqiu.

229
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
I've had enough.

230
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Princess Qianqiu.

231
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
Excuse me,

232
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,660
I need to hide here.

233
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
I'm supposed to be a divine maiden.

234
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,640
Why did I end up here?

235
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Shut up.

236
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
Covers mouth.

237
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,930
Let's go.

238
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,760
Finally got away.

239
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,960
Princess.

240
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,080
Qin Che.

241
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,940
You even found me here.

242
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,880
Princess.

243
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Princess,

244
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,210
please come out now.

245
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,920
Princess.

246
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,400
Are you crazy?

247
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,840
You got me all wet.

248
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,000
How else could I catch you?

249
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,440
Rest assured, Princess,

250
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,290
I will safely escort you to North Isle.

251
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,160
Do I really have to marry that 60-year-old man?

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,000
Yes.

253
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,450
You're determined to make my life difficult.

254
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,080
Qin Che,

255
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,560
since you've delivered yourself to me,

256
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,490
prepare to face the consequences.

257
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
Xinjiang, Di, Can.

258
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,520
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

259
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,580
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
Zhuang, Cheng.

261
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
Jin, Sheng.

262
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

263
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,020
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

264
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,250
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

265
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,120
Ting.

266
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Lu Ling.

267
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,960
Lu Ling.

268
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,240
Lu Ling.
