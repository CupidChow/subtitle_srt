1
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,720
After two months of renovation

2
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
our Hot News House

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
is finally reopening.

4
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,840
That's great!

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,880
Wonderful!

6
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,640
Nowadays,

7
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
the romantic situation of Princess Qianqiu from Huiyin

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,920
has become quite mysterious.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,200
We'll be using the latest live tracking technology

10
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
to bring you real-time updates.

11
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,920
Speaking of Princess Qianqiu and General Qin,

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
for the past two months,

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,330
there was

14
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,320
absolutely no news about them.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,900
Everyone thought they were having a relationship crisis.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,039
Yesterday at the ceremony,

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,210
they rang the bell together to dispel the rumors.

18
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,880
But who would have thought that now

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,610
the Second Prince Kanghe from Beiyu has arrived.

20
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
And apparently,

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,800
he and Princess Qianqiu have a history together.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,440
Princess,

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,570
good afternoon.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Hello.

25
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
Your Highness, Second Prince of Beiyu,

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,720
what brings you here?

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,410
Of course I'm here to keep you company.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,500
The Lord of Huiyin said yesterday

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,120
that you should show me around for a day.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
I heard today is your Lantern Festival in Huiyin,

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,020
let's go to the city together.

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,880
What's so special about the Lantern Festival?

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Come on.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
Let's go.

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
I didn't expect the Second Prince to have this side to him.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
Sister,

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
my feelings for you are genuine.

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,820
If you don't want to go with me,

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
then I'll stay here with you.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
I already have plans.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,340
Second Prince, please leave.

42
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
Brother Che,

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,280
happy fake third anniversary to us.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Look.

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,700
He was here.

46
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,640
Sister.

47
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
Where are you going? Second Prince, please stay.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,170
The Princess needs to change her clothes.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
A storm is coming.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Qin Che.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,640
Qin Che.

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,100
Take care, sir.

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,159
Come.

54
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,020
Let me tell you.

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Just do it like this.

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,690
Understand?

57
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,480
Go now.

58
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,960
I heard the birds have taken flight,

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,480
Yet love remains between the two,

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,760
From Qin times, old bonds will reunite.

61
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,520
Kid.

62
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
Who told you to recite it like that?

63
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,200
Are you Qin Che?

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes, I am.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
A beautiful lady

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,010
said she's waiting for you at the usual place.

67
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,770
Alright.

68
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,800
From Qin times, old bonds will reunite,

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,760
Che Guang.

70
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,850
What are you doing here?

71
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:44,690
General,

72
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,450
I've finally found you.

73
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,640
We've spotted those Northern Isle rebels outside the city.

74
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,970
Let's hurry over there.

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,210
You go ahead,

76
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,300
I have some matters to attend to. I'll catch up soon.

77
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,760
All right.

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,000
Princess.

79
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,880
Princess.

80
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Princess.

81
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,720
You're saying Qin Che fled after committing a crime?

82
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Yes, sister.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
I sent people to wait at his residence all night,

84
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,820
but he never showed up.

85
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,010
He can't be found anywhere in the city.

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,280
He must have known

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
that I found evidence of him murdering Liu Yue

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,740
and that's why he ran away.

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
Qin Che killed Liu Yue?

90
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,740
Second Prince,

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
don't speak such nonsense here.

92
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
I was the one

93
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,660
who provided Qin Che with an alibi back then.

94
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
Now he's about to become

95
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
Princess Huiyin's consort.

96
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,490
Rumors can be devastating.

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,320
Sister, you've been deceived by him.

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
I carefully searched

99
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
Lord Liuyue's study on the night of his murder

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
and found under the desk chair

101
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,520
a very thin strand of golden thread.

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,419
The same thread was found on Qin Che's clothes from that night.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
You want to convict

104
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
the Second Prince based on this thread alone?

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Aren't you being too frivolous?

106
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Of course not.

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,160
I reviewed your case files from that day

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,680
and found that both of you were drunk that night.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,440
Sister, are you certain

110
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,840
that you stayed by Qin Che's side the entire evening

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,320
and were completely sober?

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,840
I...

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
This is what I scraped from

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,600
underneath the incense burner in my sister's room.

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
There are still some remnants of the sleeping incense.

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,400
How dare you, Qin Che!

117
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,960
You dared to use Qianqiu to harm the Northern Yu envoy

118
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,520
and you're still on the run.

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,920
From now on,

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,640
his engagement to Qianqiu is canceled,

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
and he must be captured immediately.

122
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,040
Father!

123
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,170
So this is the fine husband you've chosen!

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
The matter is already clear.

125
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
Don't make things worse.

126
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,080
Father!

127
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,840
Sister.

128
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this earlier,

129
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,400
but you need to understand

130
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm only doing what's best for you.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,720
This Qin Che is not a good person.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
He has ulterior motives

133
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,280
and is only getting close to you to use you.

134
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,080
Stop talking.

135
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,520
Father.

136
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,130
Please give me three more days.

137
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,760
Right now, all we have is inconclusive evidence

138
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
that doesn't amount to much.

139
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Father.

140
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Lord Ma.

141
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,610
Besides the case of Lord Liuyue's murder,

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,130
I have another matter to discuss with you.

143
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,420
Second Prince, please speak.

144
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,800
I've fallen in love with Princess Qianqiu at first sight,

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
and I would like to ask you, Lord Ma,

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,320
to give Princess Qianqiu's hand in marriage to me.

147
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Our two cities

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,000
shouldn't become enemies over someone as insignificant as Qin Che.

149
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,000
No!

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,970
Regarding the marriage

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
we must consider Qianqiu's wishes.

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,640
If it can foster goodwill between our two nations,

153
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,290
I would hope that the Second Prince

154
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,690
completes his investigation of this case

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
before I pass judgment on Qin Che.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
I can agree to this marriage,

157
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
but regarding Qin Che's matter,

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,000
you

159
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
must keep your word.

160
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,810
Your daughter takes her leave.

161
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
If you ask me,

162
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Princess Qianqiu

163
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
has spent so much time with General Qin,

164
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
she must choose General Qin,

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,650
don't you think?

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,340
Breaking news!

167
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,460
Breaking news!

168
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,580
General Qin is wanted for murder,

169
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
and Princess Qianqiu is about to marry the Second Prince of Beiyu.

170
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
What?

171
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
Is that true?

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,460
How come I didn't know about this?

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,720
Mother.

174
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
So early in the morning,

175
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,040
what brings you here?

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,490
I want to use that favor.

177
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,450
Can you help me find Qin Che?

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,530
If the city lord can't find him,

179
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,500
how could I possibly find him?

180
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
Please send more people to look for him.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
If you find him,

182
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,140
please tell him

183
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
to run far away.

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,680
I heard you're going to marry Kang Hena.

185
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,200
You went through so much trouble to avoid the arranged marriage before,

186
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,860
why are you agreeing to it now because of Qin Che?

187
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Because I want to.

188
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,900
Good morning, sister.

189
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Sister,

190
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
we're getting married in a few days,

191
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
how can you be so cold to me?

192
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,330
What marriage in a few days?

193
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,090
Don't you know, sister?

194
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,890
This morning, Lord Ma arranged our marriage,

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,380
set for the fourth of July, an auspicious day for weddings.

196
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,620
But today is already the 28th.

197
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
It is a bit rushed.

198
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,240
But when we return to North Isle,

199
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,320
I will certainly give you

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,180
a much grander wedding ceremony.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,640
Sister, please don't overexert yourself these days.

202
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,700
I'll go ahead and make preparations.

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Princess,

204
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
why don't we escape?

205
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,160
Fangjue is gone too.

206
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,480
Xiaoliu,

207
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,280
tell me,

208
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,810
where could he possibly run to?

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,800
General Qin has no one to rely on in Huiyin.

210
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,800
If we're talking about who's closest to him,

211
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,530
it would only be you, Princess.

212
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,280
Could he have left Huiyin altogether?

213
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,720
The closest person to him is me.

214
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,360
Home.

215
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,940
I know where he's gone.

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,920
Xinjiang, Di, Can.

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Xinjiang, Di.

218
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

219
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,220
Bo, Jun.

220
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
Zhuang, Cheng.

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,160
Jin, Sheng.

222
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,120
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

223
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,340
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

224
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:41,840
Ni.

225
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,000
Yue.

226
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,730
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

227
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,560
Ting.

228
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,120
Lu Ling.

229
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,440
Lu Ling.

230
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,720
Lu Ling.
