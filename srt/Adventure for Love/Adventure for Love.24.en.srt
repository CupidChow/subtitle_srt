1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,320
Number 0598

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,440
to redeem your points and PiaoPiao coins.

3
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,840
This grants you three days

4
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,320
to stay in World 332.

5
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,880
Once the time expires,

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
the Bureau will automatically recall you.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,330
Qianqiu.

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,370
Qianqiu.

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,930
Qianqiu.

10
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,730
It's been three months,

11
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,660
you're finally awake.

12
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,079
Madam.

13
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,079
Madam.

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
I'd like to ask you

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,960
how to get to the Gossip House?

16
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,460
Why are you looking for the Gossip House?

17
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm here to find my relatives.

18
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
I heard that if I get on that trending list,

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,560
everyone will see my message.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,720
This is the Gossip House.

21
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,200
Madam, please don't tease me.

22
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
I heard the Gossip House is quite lively.

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,360
That's ancient history now.

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Xiao Ba,

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
take this lady to the government office.

26
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Sure thing.

27
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
Help her find her relatives.

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,440
Thank you.

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,360
I heard Lady Qianqiu has finally awakened,

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
so the City Lord's wait wasn't in vain.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Yes, indeed,

32
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,360
I've watched their journey from the beginning.

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,220
Back in the day,

34
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,500
those little articles were all the rage.

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Just one more little bite, just one.

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,210
I heard Ruofei took Mu Wan back to Dongliu.

37
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

38
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,160
Ma Ruofei seems to have grown up overnight.

39
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,800
She learned martial arts from Fang Jue.

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,530
Now she's running Dongliu City in perfect order.

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,770
She was well-taught by Mu Wan from the beginning.

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,020
That's wonderful.

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,490
General Qin.

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:18,959
No,

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
Governor.

46
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
Huiyin has become

47
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,780
truly wonderful under your leadership.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Qianqiu.

49
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,650
Are you still upset with me?

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,820
May I explain everything to you clearly now?

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,760
Qin Che.

52
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,880
I know your heart beats too.

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,360
So

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,260
all that manipulation and deception

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
doesn't matter anymore.

56
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
I just need to know now

57
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,480
that you love me, don't you?

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,880
I love you.

59
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,760
Qianqiu.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,160
You pulled me out of an endless abyss.

61
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,640
Without you,

62
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,010
I might still be trying everything

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
to get revenge on Ma Yangfei and the Governor of Beiyu.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
But after meeting you,

65
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,300
I don't want to be trapped in those obsessions anymore.

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,520
I want to work with you

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,240
to make Huiyin City even better.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I want to have

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,040
a simple,

70
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,240
ordinary,

71
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,570
happy life with you.

72
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Qin Che, fireworks.

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
Beautiful, aren't they?

74
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Qianqiu.

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
Today marks

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,440
331 days since we fell in love.

77
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,100
You actually remembered.

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,180
Of course I did.

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,220
You gave me a sky full of stars.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,930
I give you this brilliant display.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
Back then, you said someone was watching us.

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,000
Was that a lie too?

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,420
You tell me.

84
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
Qin Che.

85
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
You lied to me.

86
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
It's snowing.

87
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Shouldn't we

88
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,780
go to Drunk Spring Wind for a meal now?

89
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,700
What are you doing?

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's go.

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,580
It's about time

92
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
we head home.

93
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
Look, it's already dawn.

94
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't want to leave,

95
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I don't want to go.

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,160
Where do you

97
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
want to go if you don't leave?

98
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
I don't know.

99
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Maybe to the bustling modern world.

100
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Or perhaps

101
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,540
to the ancient times with high walls and grand courtyards.

102
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,860
Qin Che, do you believe it?

103
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
I can become anyone.

104
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,640
However,

105
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
I can never be Ma Qianqiu again.

106
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,640
I am

107
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,840
Number 0598.

108
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,920
I am Number 0598.

109
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,440
You are Number 0598.

110
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,240
I spent all my points and PiaoPiao coins

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
just to come here.

112
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Qin Che.

113
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,120
We only have three days left.

114
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Guess who I am?

115
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,770
How did you move all the flowers from the royal city here?

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
From now on,

117
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,640
this is our home.

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Let me see.

119
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,400
Twenty points?

120
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,920
Are you trying to give me a heart attack!

121
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,600
And you still dare to ask me to sign this.

122
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,040
What's going on?

123
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,840
So he got a bad score, it happens,

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,040
don't get all worked up and hit the child.

125
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,520
Look.

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,440
Twenty points,

127
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm going to spank you for this.

128
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Father,

129
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,500
don't run away.

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Father, please don't hit me.

131
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
Mother.

132
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Father.

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,680
Let me... let me catch you!

134
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,240
Father, Mother grabbed food with her hands,

135
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,100
will you eat it?

136
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,140
Here, eat this.

137
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,360
If tomorrow when I wake up,

138
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,920
I disappear,

139
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,650
what will you do?

140
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Then I will definitely find you.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,240
If I can't,

142
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,380
I'll wait for you to come back.

143
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,380
What I said at the restaurant yesterday,

144
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,560
you heard it all, didn't you?

145
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,210
Then why didn't you ask me about it?

146
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,220
We promised each other

147
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
to be honest with each other.

148
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,220
If you don't want to talk about it,

149
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,880
I won't ask.

150
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Actually,

151
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
I don't belong to this world.

152
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,490
We have a Floating Management Bureau where I'm from,

153
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I finally became a member,

154
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,660
and received an ID number.

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,520
But I still felt lonely.

156
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,480
They called me Number 0598.

157
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Only when I was sent to another world

158
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,160
on a mission

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
could I have my own name.

160
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,360
Like,

161
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
Ma Qianqiu.

162
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
In each world I visit,

163
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,000
I carry a mission.

164
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,930
I must try to get close to the target person

165
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
and complete my mission.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,160
Only then can I earn Float Coins and points,

167
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,260
and gain the right to choose which world to go to.

168
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,660
But this time, due to an operator's mistake,

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,250
I arrived here having forgotten everything.

170
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,290
But because of that,

171
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,300
for the first time,

172
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,700
I truly fell in love with someone.

173
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,360
I wanted to grow old with him.

174
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
But by coincidence, I completed my mission.

175
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,340
I can no longer stay in this world.

176
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,290
Will you disappear,

177
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,640
or just your soul will leave?

178
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
I don't know.

179
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
Because before,

180
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,960
I was always eager to leave.

181
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,720
I never paid attention to

182
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,900
what would happen afterward.

183
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Then promise me

184
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,090
you won't forget me.

185
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,930
Don't forget everything we've been through,

186
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
okay?

187
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Xin Jiang Di Can

188
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
Lei Cai Long Yan Peng Song Hui

189
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,930
Bo Jun

190
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,290
Bo Jun

191
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,240
