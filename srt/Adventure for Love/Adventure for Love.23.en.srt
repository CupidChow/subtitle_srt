1
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,680
What's wrong?

2
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,410
Don't be afraid.

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
You're safe now.

4
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,400
It's alright.

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,759
Do you think

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,720
Qin Che will spare you?

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,360
Ma Yangfei.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
You're not crazy.

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,280
Of course I'm not crazy.

10
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,479
If I hadn't been careless,

11
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,160
how could that bitch Mu Wan have tricked me?

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,360
You all.

13
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,160
Qianqiu.

14
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,000
Qianqiu.

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,760
What are you doing?

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,020
Daughter, let go of me!

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Daughter,

18
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,360
you're the only person I can trust now.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
No one else.

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,760
Go!

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
Go kill Qin Che and Mu Wan for me,

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,840
otherwise

23
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
they won't spare us.

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
And

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,480
our Huiyin City,

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,980
it must not fall into their hands!

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,500
You've killed so many people,

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,320
yet you still show no remorse,

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,120
and now you want to kill them too!

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,380
It's hopeless.

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Qin Che has been using you all along.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,079
You think

33
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,720
all he wants is Huiyin.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
That's not it.

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
He wants revenge,

36
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,010
revenge against Beiyu,

37
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,610
revenge against the Lord of Beiyu.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,760
Did he ever tell you

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,370
that his biological father

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,480
is the Lord of Beiyu?

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,890
What did you say?

42
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,800
Years ago,

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
I sent his mother to Beiyu as a spy.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,660
Instead of bringing back useful intelligence,

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,320
she fell in love with the Lord of Beiyu

46
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,580
and became pregnant with Qin Che.

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,280
When the Lord of Beiyu found out,

48
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,519
he wanted to kill both mother and child.

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,120
It was I

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
who took in the mother and child.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,400
And it was I

52
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,820
Killed his mother with his own hands.

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Ma Yangfei.

54
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Does Qin Che know about all this?

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,180
Princess Qianqiu,

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,760
Qin Che certainly knows about these things,

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,880
that's why he lured the Northern Isle Prince here.

58
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,400
The City Lord wants you to be careful of Qin Che,

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,120
to protect Huiyin's legacy.

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,360
City Lord.

61
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
Qin Che,

62
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
how much suffering have you endured

63
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,850
to become such a good person

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
who stands before me now?

65
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,010
Qianqiu,

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
you shouldn't have come here.

67
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
Go back first.

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,440
What do you mean?

69
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Let me go!

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,960
Qianqiu, please calm down.

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll tell you everything when we get back later, okay?

72
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,960
Xiao Liu.

73
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes, Princess,

74
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,450
the General must have his reasons,

75
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,960
shall we go back first?

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Qianqiu, go back with Xiao Liu first.

77
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Let go of me!

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,060
So you knew he was hiding things from me too, didn't you?

79
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
City Lord.

80
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,000
Gone.

81
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,680
Princess.

82
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,400
Qianqiu.

83
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,440
Qianqiu.

84
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Let go of me.

85
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,000
So you've been in contact with Mu Wan all this time

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,530
but never told me the truth.

87
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,840
You placed Xiaoliu by my side

88
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,600
to monitor my every move.

89
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,600
It's because you never trusted me.

90
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,880
So you knew that your birth father

91
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,280
is the Lord of North Isle?

92
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,000
I knew.

93
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,360
Did you know your mother

94
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
was sent to North Isle as a spy by Ma Yangfei

95
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,680
and then killed by him?

96
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,000
I knew.

97
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,880
So...

98
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,080
So you never thought about

99
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,880
living a simple life with me where no one knows us,

100
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,640
did you?

101
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,800
Let's go back first, Qianqiu.

102
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,560
Did you?

103
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Qianqiu.

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,330
Please calm down first,

105
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,620
I'll tell you everything when we get back, okay?

106
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,410
Xiaoliu,

107
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,650
take the Princess back.

108
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Princess.

109
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,580
Don't touch me.

110
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Princess.

111
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Princess.

112
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,680
So,

113
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,200
so you all played me for a fool,

114
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,680
was it fun?

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,720
It's not like that.

116
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,800
Was it fun?

117
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
No, it's not like that,

118
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,320
Xiaoliu really likes the Princess,

119
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Xiaoliu truly cares about the Princess,

120
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
Xiaoliu didn't...

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
Princess.

122
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,760
Princess.

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Princess.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Princess.

125
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
Princess.

126
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,560
Princess.

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,400
Let her go.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
But she doesn't look well.

129
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,280
Princess.

130
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,880
Princess.

131
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,080
Princess.

132
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,480
Princess.

133
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,040
Qianqiu.

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,450
Why am I dreaming about this again?

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
Number 0598.

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,280
Number 0598.

137
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Who are you?

138
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,920
Can you explain everything clearly at once?

139
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Okay.

140
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,520
We are the Piaopiao Management Bureau.

141
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,180
You are Piaopiao Number 0598.

142
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
You were supposed to go to World 332,

143
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
which is this Huiyin City where you are now,

144
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,800
to complete the mission of healing Qin Che

145
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,930
and preventing war,

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
in order to earn points and Piaopiao coins.

147
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,370
But due to our operator's mistake,

148
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,810
your memory was erased,

149
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,740
and you were placed in this world.

150
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,840
We are truly very sorry about that.

151
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Finally finished explaining.

152
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,800
What does that mean?

153
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,080
It seems Number 0598,

154
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,800
you still don't quite understand.

155
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,320
We'll restore your memory right away,

156
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,380
then you'll understand everything.

157
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,280
I...

158
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,640
I am Number 0598.

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,280
That's right.

160
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,560
You've completed the mission in World 332,

161
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,000
earned points and Piaopiao coins.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Now you can choose

163
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,280
to enter a more challenging world to complete missions,

164
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,340
where you can earn even more points and Piaopiao coins.

165
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,960
I don't want to leave.

166
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,760
But Number 0598,

167
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
you've already completed your mission,

168
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,440
you must leave.

169
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,480
Please.

170
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,890
I'm begging you,

171
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,090
don't make me leave.

172
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,700
I still have unanswered questions here.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Please, I'm begging you.

174
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,120
She's so pitiful.

175
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,760
Why don't we help her?

176
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
What are you talking about?

177
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,400
If we get caught,

178
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,930
our wages will be deducted.

179
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,000
There's hardly anything left after all the deductions already.

180
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,360
Help if you want, it's your wages that'll be cut.

181
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,690
I can't help her anyway.

182
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
Isn't there that method?

183
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,520
She probably wouldn't agree to it.

184
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,120
What method?

185
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,960
Fine.

186
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,160
Actually, you can use your points and Piaopiao coins

187
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,840
to exchange for extended stay time.

188
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,640
But if you exchange everything,

189
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,720
you'll have nothing left,

190
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
making progress extremely difficult,

191
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
and you'll have to return to previous worlds
