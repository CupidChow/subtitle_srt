1
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,740
Why wasn't I the one who brought you to the mortal world?

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,100
General Qin, don't worry,

3
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,080
I will escape in time

4
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,250
and won't be a burden to you.

5
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,240
Fine.

6
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,650
So you're agreeing?

7
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,400
Do I have any other choice now?

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,759
Good man.

9
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,640
However,

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,680
we have something more important

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,080
that we haven't done yet.

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,479
What?

13
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,460
The engagement

14
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,610
is official!

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,720
The Princess and General Qin have officially announced their relationship!

16
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Great!

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,940
This is wonderful,

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,610
just wonderful!

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,520
Thank you all

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,370
for your support along the way.

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
I believe heaven

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,160
will give a chance to everyone who believes in love.

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,920
From now on,

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
I will continue to love you all

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
with my new identity.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
From now on, you can all call me Mrs. Qin.

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,640
Governor.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Governor,

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
Princess Qianqiu

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
just announced her engagement to General Qin.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,120
No rush.

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,770
Qianqiu's cleverness.

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,220
I know her well enough.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
She's just using petty tricks.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,280
Let's wait for her to slip up on her own.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
City Lord,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,480
why don't we deal with her now?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,720
She's still useful to us now.

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
These hot rumors actually serve my purpose.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,400
We've been waiting for you!

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
General Qin, come out and celebrate with us!

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
And when will you two get married?

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,400
Liu Yue went too far threatening the General

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
and almost exposed our plan.

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
Fortunately, the General

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,890
used the Princess to clear himself of suspicion.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,370
I really underestimated that Liu Yue,

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,450
I almost fell into his trap.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,600
General,

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,480
our Princess requests a meeting with you.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Tell the Princess

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,380
I'll see her later.

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,760
He's really handsome.

54
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,090
When Xiao Liu brings people tomorrow,

55
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,080
we'll...

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,800
Security checks in Beiyu have become stricter recently,

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,240
our peace mission escort

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,980
may not be able to enter Beiyu successfully.

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
However, using Ma Qianqiu's identity as a priestess,

60
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,480
bringing down Ma Yangfei shouldn't be difficult.

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,600
Fortunately, Liu Yue didn't interfere with the general's plan,

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,130
so his death wasn't in vain.

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,330
He should receive a proper burial in Huiyin City.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,200
Who?

65
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,600
Speak!

66
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,520
You've been watching me these past few days,

67
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,000
what exactly is your purpose?

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,530
Talk now!

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
Please spare me, Princess,

70
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,760
I just took the money.

71
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,740
Providing your information to the Huiwen tabloid.

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,050
They're truly everywhere.

73
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
Even more insane than my homeland.

74
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,680
Princess, what is this homeland you speak of?

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Where I come from.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,530
What exactly is their purpose?

77
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm not sure either,

78
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,840
I only know that Boss Rong has bribed many informants

79
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,570
to record information about you and General Qin.

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
Rong Anjie.

81
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,880
Princess,

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,080
this Rong Anjie is no ordinary person.

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,480
He owns the largest jewelry store in Huiyin

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,080
and has been devoted to you for years

85
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,610
and spent quite a lot of money supporting you.

86
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,280
Where did this come from?

87
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,360
They have presentations in ancient times too?

88
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,760
Not bad at all.

89
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,960
With my irresistible charm

90
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,140
I should probably put opening for business on my schedule.

91
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
This is the story between us

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Simply put

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
it's about how we met

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
how we fell in love

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,360
and how we overcame numerous obstacles

96
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,220
to be together.

97
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,380
Come on, memorize it quickly.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
What's all

99
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,720
this? Do we really have this much of a story?

100
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,480
Do we?

101
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,000
Of course it's for the common people to see.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,040
First, we need to make them believe.

103
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,640
A pure-hearted athletic mutt

104
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,080
and a princess who's mastered all forms of martial arts?

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
I don't get it.

106
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
These are our character profiles,

107
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,440
basically how we're portrayed

108
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
in this story.

109
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
You are a drifter,

110
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
insecure,

111
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,560
afraid of getting hurt,

112
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,000
a young general who's never been in love.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,280
And me?

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Of course, it's the innocent, adorable princess

115
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,920
who constantly radiates charm.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,400
That day, the sunshine was perfect

117
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,520
as I rode in wearing a red outfit.

118
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,040
On that day,

119
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,480
you seemed to have found the love of your life

120
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,400
and couldn't get it out of your mind ever since.

121
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,760
But due to our different social statuses,

122
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,320
I could only keep this love deeply hidden in my heart.

123
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,330
Look,

124
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,440
let me quickly go through this with you.

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,280
So basically, you've had a crush on me for years,

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
I've had a crush on you for years,

127
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,040
we've been secretly in love with each other,

128
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,080
keeping it buried deep inside,

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,410
until finally jealousy brings it all out,

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
then we confess our feelings to each other

131
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
and get together.

132
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
Why don't dating shows hire me as a writer?

133
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
Such a waste.

134
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,680
Do you really think any of this is useful?

135
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,540
Of course it is!

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
All these things she's talking about,

137
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,580
I don't understand a single word.

138
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,840
Then what's this

139
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,760
wall slam and forced kiss

140
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
supposed to mean?

141
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,520
You don't even know that?

142
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,920
Here,

143
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,540
let me show you.

144
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Get it now?

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,860
Your Highness,

146
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,640
is this what you meant?

147
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes, that's it.

148
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,330
However,

149
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
could you please let me go now?

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,840
No, no,

151
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,760
that's not it.

152
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,920
Xinjiang, Can.

153
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,520
Xinjiang.

154
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

155
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,160
Bo, Jun.

156
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,620
Bo, Jun.

157
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,620
Zhuang, Cheng.

158
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,260
Jin, Sheng.

159
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,940
Jin, Sheng.

160
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
Dan, Wei, Ping, Ling.

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,260
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

162
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,920
Ni.

163
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,800
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

164
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,730
Nan, Zi, Lei, Ze, Zhen, Yao, Zai, Zhen, Kai, Jing, Lu.

165
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,360
Lu, Ling.

166
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,640
Lu, Ling.
