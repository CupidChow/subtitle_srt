1
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,759
Wait,

2
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
let me add one more line.

3
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
Qin Che flips over and pins down the princess,

4
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,770
looking incredibly dominant.

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,640
Princess,

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,880
why are these scenes so aesthetically romantic?

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
True,

8
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,880
today's audience definitely won't accept

9
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,360
so many elevated shots.

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,280
No,

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
let's do it again.

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,480
Qin Che,

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
did you miss me at all?

14
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
I missed you.

15
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
I think of you

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,960
every moment of every day.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,840
Qianqiu,

18
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,240
I won't let you go to that political marriage.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,840
Really?

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,560
Really.

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,970
To the ends of the earth,

22
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,850
together in life and death.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,420
This story is so interesting.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,960
By the way, Princess,

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,960
is it really right for us

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
to use General Qin like this?

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
And what about your reputation?

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,840
Stop.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
Compared to one's life,

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,370
reputation is the cheapest thing.

31
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,080
Since we're using Qin Che to avoid the arranged marriage,

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,530
we need to make this as big as possible,

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,760
preferably reaching the ears of the North Isle City Lord.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,800
Worst case, we'll go all in.

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,240
By the way,

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
is that trending news board you mentioned really effective?

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,040
Of course,

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
the citizens of our Huiyin City

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,280
check the trending news board daily

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,810
to learn about stories happening in the city.

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
Welcome!

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Tickets, please.

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,160
Please enter.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,360
Okay.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,730
welcome to our establishment.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Today's Hot News has been revamped,

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,680
and from now on,

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,040
I will bring you more,

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,970
more authentic,

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,780
and up-to-date information.

52
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,960
Great.

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,880
Everyone, please look,

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,400
the top story on our Hot News chart is...

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,480
Princess Qianqiu's secret bathroom rendezvous with General Qin.

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,720
I've secured good seats for us.

57
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,980
These stories are already spreading throughout the city.

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,000
Excellent.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,930
Although I've escaped certain death,

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,920
Qin Che is still relentlessly pursuing me,

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,380
determined to destroy me.

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,940
Now I'm being forced to marry a 60-year-old man.

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,040
Rather than waiting for my doom,

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,860
I'll take the initiative.

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,760
Once I've tied myself closely to you,

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,100
let's see how you can kill me then.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,640
Next,

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,420
invite Qin Che here for me.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
I want to invite him for tea.

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,290
General Qin has helped me numerous times,

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,180
so I've specially invited you for tea

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,240
to catch up.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,380
I still have official duties,

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm afraid I don't have time to join you for tea, Princess.

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,410
General Qin, that jade pendant of yours is quite unique.

76
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
I noticed it the other day.

77
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,370
It's just an ordinary item,

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Princess, if you have something to say, please speak.

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,180
Aren't you afraid I'll reveal your secrets?

80
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Princess, you seem to have forgotten the pain once the wound has healed.

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,010
Princess, that hairpin of yours is quite unique as well.

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
What's wrong?

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,160
Nothing,

84
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
I just thought

85
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,800
what General Qin was planning to do.

86
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
The gossip column was right after all.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,050
What are you looking at?

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,120
About today's private meeting between the Princess and General Qin,

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,080
if anyone dares to spread this news,

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,540
I'll rip out their tongue.

91
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,520
Move along!

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,580
What are you doing?

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,560
This jade pendant is mine now.

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,290
This Ma Qianqiu has changed drastically.

95
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,410
Could she really have lost her memory?

96
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
Isn't that General Qin?

97
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Yes, it is.

98
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Do you think he and the princess

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,760
are really having an affair?

100
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Perhaps.

101
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Fangjue,

102
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,620
go find out what's happening.

103
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,170
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
Princess Ruofei,

105
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
your schedule includes

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,000
half an hour of garden tour,

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,080
half an hour of dinner,

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,210
and one hour of rose beauty treatment.

109
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,760
So many things to do.

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,120
Isn't this my sister Qianqiu?

111
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Congratulations!

112
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
I heard older men are more caring,

113
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
you're so lucky, sister.

114
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,800
Ruofei,

115
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,140
you're not a little girl anymore,

116
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
why are you still acting

117
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
so childish?

118
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
What do you mean?

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,820
What does she mean?

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,450
Exactly what I said.

121
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,600
You...

122
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,490
I won't stoop to your level.

123
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,080
Father has given his orders.

124
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,000
The marriage contract will be sent to Beiyu by noon tomorrow.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,680
Sister,

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,080
you'd better enjoy

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,240
your last moments of freedom.

128
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,400
So soon?

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,180
Looks like I need to make my move tonight.

130
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,920
Ma Ruofei, I'll kill you!

131
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,640
Master Liu Yue

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,880
has traveled a long way from North Isle

133
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,520
and must taste our Huiyin's delicacies.

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,280
You're too kind, Lord of Huiyin.

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,890
We'll be family from now on,

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
so we should visit each other often.

137
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,169
Congratulations, sister.

138
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
On such an important day,

139
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,560
how can we just drink?

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,120
Does Ruofei have any good suggestions?

141
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Sister just told me

142
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,920
that she prepared a performance

143
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
to entertain us.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,120
After all, when she marries into North Isle,

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,240
she can't let Huiyin lose face.

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,840
Ruofei speaks wisely.

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
Qianqiu.

148
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,300
If that's the case,

149
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,860
Qianqiu, come up here.

150
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,760
Father,

151
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,450
I didn't prepare anything.

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,520
Come on.

153
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
Sister, don't be modest,

154
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
just present what you've

155
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,020
prepared earlier.

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,530
You can do it!

157
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Your acting skills are impressive,

158
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
but I haven't prepared a damn thing.

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
Though I could take this chance

160
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,780
to interact more with Qin Che.

161
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,120
Alright.

162
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
To welcome Master Liu Yue,

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
I'll humbly offer a poem.

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
I hear the birds have awakened,

165
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Love entwines two hearts as before.

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,320
In Qin's time, distant past finally meets,

167
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
Che's clear light reveals my heart.

168
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,480
General,

169
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,000
I love Qin Che.

170
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,240
I hope our two cities, Huiyin and North Isle,

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
will maintain lasting friendship.

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,340
Wonderful!

173
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,140
She actually managed to dodge it.

174
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,140
Little sister,

175
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,780
reading more books is indeed useful.

176
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,560
If there are any characters you don't understand in the future,

177
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,760
I'll teach you.

178
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,300
The princess said she loves General Qin,

179
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,520
really.

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
The princess said she only loves General Qin,

181
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,570
and wants to elope with him.

182
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,880
Princess Qianqiu and General Qin have secretly pledged to marry.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,720
Princess,

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
by now,

185
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,520
the whole city probably knows about your confession to General Qin.

186
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Perfect.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,080
Lord of Huiyin City,

188
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,880
I'll go change my clothes first.

189
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
1,000 taels.

190
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,000
