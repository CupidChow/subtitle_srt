1
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Even though spring has arrived,

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,620
you can still catch a cold if you're not careful.

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
When I think about when we first met,

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,160
Xiao Liu said you were fierce

5
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,120
and no one dared to approach you.

6
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,120
I actually wonder

7
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,210
if the person I see before me now

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
and the one I've heard about

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,250
are really the same person.

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Just met me?

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,460
Have you really lost your memory?

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,620
Slip of the tongue.

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,400
By the way,

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
how did you find me?

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,120
I followed the horse tracks to find you.

16
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Didn't I tell you

17
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,920
that you should at least have Xiao Liu with you

18
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,050
and not go out alone?

19
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
By the way, where's Xiao Liu?

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
How is she?

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,280
Xiao Liu is quite clever.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Fangjue found her

23
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,880
and has already sent her back to the royal city.

24
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,760
However...

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,160
So I guess I won't be able

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,480
to be the goddess at the Lantern Festival anymore?

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
That's right.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
It's fine,

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,250
I wasn't that eager to do it anyway.

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,440
By the way,

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,600
I have something more important

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,660
that I want to tell you.

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,240
General.

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,420
General, we've confirmed

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
that those who kidnapped the princess

36
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,360
were indeed the escaped soldiers from North Yu

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,820
who wanted to use her as leverage against us.

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,700
Where are they?

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,170
I failed in my duty, sir.

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
When we went to capture them,

41
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,810
they were already gone,

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,090
but there were signs of a struggle.

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
They might have been taken by someone else.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,930
The envoys from North Yu will arrive in a few days.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,680
We can't afford any complications during this time.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
Send more men

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,530
and leave no survivors.

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,360
When will we escort the princess back?

49
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,649
What's the situation with Ma Yangfei?

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,650
People lost hair in ancient times too.

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,900
The princess needs a few more days to recover. We'll discuss it later.

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,080
General,

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
don't forget our plan

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,060
and your purpose for getting close to the princess.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,680
Get some rest.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,900
Everything is fine in the royal city.

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,010
Your wounds still need a few more days to heal.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
How about

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,640
we stay here for a couple more days?

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
I think the air here is really nice.

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,280
Yeah,

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,880
it's nice.

63
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,660
Let's stargaze together.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,440
Why look at stars?

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
This vast sea of stars

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
is my welcome gift to you.

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,280
Fireflies.

68
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,720
Look,

69
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
how beautiful.

70
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
Why is it still so cold?

71
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
Living free as a bird,

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm actually missing the hot soup from Drunk Spring Wind.

73
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Then let's go now.

74
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,880
Sure.

75
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,050
Let's go.

76
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,560
Cheers!

77
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
This feels so nice.

78
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Qin Che.

79
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,400
If one day

80
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,640
you find that you don't belong here,

81
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,740
but you don't know who you are,

82
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
what would you do?

83
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I once thought I didn't belong here.

84
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,640
I was born without a father.

85
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,060
Everyone called me a bastard.

86
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
My mother often said

87
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,170
she'd be better off without me.

88
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,570
Later, my mother and I came to Huiyin City.

89
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,370
I thought everything would get better

90
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,240
and she wouldn't suffer so much.

91
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
But it didn't.

92
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
One day she came out of the royal city

93
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,740
covered in wounds.

94
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,300
She completely lost her mind.

95
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,000
From that day on,

96
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
I felt that every day I lived

97
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
was like being in hell,

98
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,700
unable to breathe.

99
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Qin Che.

100
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
You are a living, breathing person.

101
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,220
You have joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.

102
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
You have love,

103
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,020
and hatred.

104
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,130
You understand the changing seasons,

105
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,280
and appreciate the gentle sun and moon.

106
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,880
Princess.

107
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,600
Every moment I spend with you,

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,360
I feel truly alive.

109
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Princess,

110
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,940
the Lady is furious

111
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,650
and sent me to bring you back to the royal city.

112
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
I mean,

113
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,240
you're a princess of high standing,

114
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,120
how could you spend the night with a man so casually?

115
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
That's my fiancé.

116
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
Fiancé or not,

117
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,810
you're not married yet.

118
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,920
Jealous?

119
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,460
Don't change the subject.

120
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,160
You didn't show up for the competition,

121
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
making Ruofei's victory seem hollow,

122
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,340
and subjecting her to gossip.

123
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,680
So what does Mother want?

124
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
A rematch.

125
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
I'd rather not,

126
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
the ceremonial ritual is tomorrow.

127
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,800
I'll just pay for an announcement myself,

128
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,960
explain to everyone

129
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,680
that I chose to withdraw,

130
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,840
okay?

131
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,400
Qianqiu.

132
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,280
You want... you want to be the Goddess.

133
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
No.

134
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
I don't want to be.

135
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,560
I still have to go face my father's scolding.

136
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm very busy,

137
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,850
so I'll be going now.

138
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
You want me to take the fall for your daughter.

139
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,170
I'm not that stupid.

140
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,210
Later, send someone to apply Green Linglong on the chime bells.

141
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,100
Be careful.

142
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,130
Green Linglong.

143
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,000
Xiao Liu.

144
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Let me ask you,

145
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Princess.

146
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
what is Green Linglong?

147
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Princess.

148
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,520
Green Linglong is a secret poison

149
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,250
from our Huiyin organization.

150
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
How come you were kidnapped once

151
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,500
and don't even remember this?

152
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,460
Is this poison very powerful?

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Of course it is.

154
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,320
This Green Linglong is colorless and odorless.

155
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
Just a tiny bit on the skin,

156
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,520
and in less than three hours,

157
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
a person will suffocate to death.

158
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,520
And this poison only reveals its green color

159
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,180
when placed in boiling water,

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
making it very difficult to detect.

161
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Then tomorrow, besides the Goddess,

162
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
who else can access the chime bells?

163
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,240
The chime bells?

164
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
It should be General Qin.

165
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,800
This year he's been specially permitted by the city lord

166
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,480
to hand over the small mallet used for striking the bells.

167
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,810
Could Ma Yangfei have murderous intentions toward Qin Che?

168
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,640
Is Ruofei ready?

169
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
Ruofei has a stomachache today,

170
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm afraid she won't be able to come.

171
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,160
What?

172
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
What about the Goddess then?

173
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,920
The Goddess has arrived.

174
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,290
She's so beautiful.

175
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,760
She looks amazing.

176
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,840
Truly worthy of being called the Goddess.

177
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,170
She really deserves the title of Goddess.

178
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Father.

179
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,760
Mother.

180
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,240
Xinjiang, Can.

181
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Xinjiang.

182
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

183
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,960
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

184
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,360
Bojun.

185
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Zhuangcheng.

186
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,360
Jinsheng.

187
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,000
Jinsheng.

188
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,940
Danwei, Pingling.

189
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,380
Miao, An, Hao, Wang, Tao, Rui, Kai, Qing, Yu.

190
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,000
