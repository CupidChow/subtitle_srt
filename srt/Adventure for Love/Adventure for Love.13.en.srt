1
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,520
Still refusing to accept it.

2
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,400
Didn't you say I was doing this for publicity?

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
I did say that.

4
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
The Princess said

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,080
that Ma Ruofei has already been

6
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
elevated to the status of new goddess in these two months,

7
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,700
and she doesn't need any more publicity now.

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,539
The Princess also said

9
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:36,880
she wishes

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,640
General Zhu finds his desired person soon.

11
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
Phase three.

12
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Princess.

13
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,740
You haven't eaten anything for two days.

14
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
Can you tell me what happened?

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,560
It's nothing.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Stage one:

17
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
avoidance.

18
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Xiao Liu.

19
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,840
Why doesn't he like me?

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,920
I've wasted my feelings on him.

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,200
Princess, please stop crying.

22
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,160
You've been crying for a month now.

23
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,680
Stage two: emotional outburst.

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,160
Will he?

25
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,160
Stage Three: Self-destruction.

26
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,760
Princess,

27
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,760
please stop this self-destructive behavior.

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm simply appreciating the beauty of life.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,040
But Princess,

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
why won't you accept General Qin?

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
Besides you,

32
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,840
he doesn't interact with any other women,

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,240
so how could he possibly like someone else?

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,600
That's only because the person he likes

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,680
isn't here.

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
Xiao Liu,

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,970
you need to keep your eyes open.

38
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Is there something between you and Fang Jue?

39
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
No,

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
really nothing.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
Really nothing?

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
Whether there is or not,

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,080
as long as you're happy,

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
you can marry whoever you want,

45
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
or not get married at all.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
You can stay here with me,

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
or go out and travel,

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
it's up to you.

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Princess,

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,440
Xiao Liu hopes you will be

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,460
the happiest person in the world.

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,640
Here you go.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,880
No.

54
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,100
The envoys from North Yu will arrive in Huiyin soon,

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
don't worry, General,

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,560
everything has been arranged.

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Even if the North Yu envoys come,

58
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,500
they won't find any evidence.

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Any news from the royal city lately?

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,080
No,

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,640
they seem to be busy with the Lantern Festival.

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
I heard that the new goddess of the Lantern Festival

63
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,650
is Princess Ruofei.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,660
I don't want to.

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
I don't want to, Mother.

66
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
I finally have a chance

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
to be the goddess of the Lantern Festival,

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
why should I give it up to Ma Qianqiu?

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,159
My sweet, good daughter.

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
Being the Lantern Festival goddess

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
means staying up late, dancing,

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,320
and attending so many events.

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,980
It's absolutely exhausting.

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Besides,

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
you won't have time for your beauty sleep,

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
and you won't look your best.

77
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,760
No way.

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
They like me so much now,

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't let them down.

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,360
We have to use this trick.

81
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,540
Come here, Ruofei.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,200
Look.

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,880
This is a challenge from Ma Qianqiu.

84
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,760
She wants to compete with you,

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
how outrageous!

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,580
Ruofei, let's accept her challenge,

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
but we must win fair and square.

88
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Right?

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Ma Qianqiu.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Okay.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,320
I must defeat her.

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,140
Defeat her.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
After all, Ma Qianqiu

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,170
has been the Goddess for so many years,

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
beating Ruofei should be a piece of cake.

96
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
What is this?

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,159
It's a challenge letter from Princess Ruofei,

98
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,880
she wants to compete with you for the Lantern Festival Goddess title.

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,480
I won't go.

100
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm finally enjoying some peace and quiet.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,140
I heard it will be held by the Hao River this year.

102
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,410
We can leave the palace.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,100
Never mind,

104
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
it's too sunny outside.

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,480
I heard it's a partner dance this year,

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,760
and the Goddess gets to choose her own dance partner.

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
This is a perfect opportunity

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,920
for you and General Qin to make a public appearance together.

109
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,980
We don't need to put on a show anymore.

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,440
General Qin is indeed busy lately.

111
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
I heard that the envoy from North Isle

112
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
will arrive in Huiyin soon

113
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,900
to investigate Envoy Liu Yue's case.

114
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,080
What?

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
North Isle only said they'd suspend the marriage alliance,

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
they never said they'd cancel it.

117
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Knowing Ma Yangfei's character,

118
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,130
he's definitely planning to marry me off.

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Xiao Liu.

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just the Goddess Competition, isn't it?

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
I accept.

122
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:18,880
Ruofei will win.

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
Professional team.

124
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
Ruofei will win.

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,880
I...

126
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
Ma Qianqiu, don't be so smug,

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,140
I will definitely defeat you.

128
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh really? I'm so scared,

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,659
little sister Ruofei.

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
Just you wait.

131
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,810
Let's go.

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,640
Princess.

133
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
What's wrong?

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,640
I... my leg is cramping.

135
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
What should we do?

136
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,040
General Qin, we're over here,

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
the princess has a leg cramp.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,920
Let him go.

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,370
Is he coming?

140
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,820
Say something.

141
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,330
Is he coming?

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,980
You've got a cramp.

143
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,760
Qin Che, what are you doing?

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't move.

145
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Put me down.

146
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Move again and I'll throw you in the river to feed the fish.

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,130
Is your leg feeling better?

148
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,960
Why haven't you

149
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,660
seen me for months?

150
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,920
Didn't you say

151
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,480
we're just using each other

152
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,210
and don't need to get too close?

153
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
About what happened with Ping'er before,

154
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
I lost my mind.

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,800
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,080
I see.

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,920
I understand.

158
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,160
No, that's not right.

159
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,160
Am I too easily fooled?

160
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,920
About him liking Ma Qianqiu.

161
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,720
No,

162
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I need to know the truth before I die.

163
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,120
Qin Che,

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,560
have you ever

165
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
loved anyone?

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
I haven't.

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
Haven't?

168
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Then why did you draw so many pictures of me?

169
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,580
What pictures?

170
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
The ones from the day our engagement was announced,

171
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,160
the ones you showed to Rong Anjie.

172
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,090
Fang Jue even took them back later.

173
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,330
You mean when I carried you,

174
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,480
that time?

175
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,240
Those were drawn by an artist I hired,

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,700
just taking precautions.

178
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
An artist?

179
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,720
No, wait,

180
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
that time I went to find you because of Ping'er,

181
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,700
who were you drawing then?

182
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
That time I was drawing Ping'er,

183
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,840
I needed to find a body double based on her measurements,

184
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,700
I was just making a few notes on it.

185
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,000
Ping'er, I see.

186
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,360
That should,

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
that should be right.

188
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,020
Yes, that's it.

189
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,440
No, wait,

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
that time you were planning to find a body double,

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,050
you even argued with me.

192
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,580
Never mind,

193
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,050
it's all in the past.

194
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,880
So he doesn't like that version of me.

195
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,260
That's wonderful!

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,680
So,

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,770
it's so great that I don't like you?

198
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,140
You don't understand.

199
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
But now,

200
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,720
there's still one small issue.

201
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,400
Tell me.

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,080
Xin Jiang Di Can.

203
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,810
Xin Jiang Di.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,440
Bo Jun.

205
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,080
Bo Jun.

206
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
Zhuang Cheng.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,720
Jin Sheng.

208
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,520
Dan Wei Ping Ling.

209
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,210
Miao An Hao Wang Tao Rui Kai Qing Yu.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Yue.

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,460
Nan Zi Lei Ze Zhen Yao Zai Zhen Kai Jing Lu.

212
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,320
Ting.

213
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,480
Lu Ling.

214
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Lu Ling.
