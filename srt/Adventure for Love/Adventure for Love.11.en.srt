1
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,400
Princess,

2
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,039
you haven't actually fallen in love with me, have you?

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,920
I'm truly sorry, General Qin,

4
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,940
I overstepped my boundaries.

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,960
From now on,

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
I won't try to figure out

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,650
what kind of person you really are.

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
But Ping'er,

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
I must save her.

10
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,420
As you wish.

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,760
Fine,

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,400
then I now order you as the Princess

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
to release Ping'er.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,060
I will acknowledge

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,650
that those items were gifts from me to her.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
A reward.

17
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
Didn't you just insist

18
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,100
that you needed evidence to convict her?

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,079
And now you want to use

20
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,960
a casual mention of a reward

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
to free her from trouble?

22
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,600
Wait until you have higher authority

23
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
before deciding her fate.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
Princess, please leave.

25
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,140
Give me three days.

26
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
I will find evidence.

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Don't touch Ping'er until then.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,640
I'll also beg Ma Yangfei.

29
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,890
Let Fangjue escort you.

30
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Don't go out alone this late at night

31
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
whether it's you or Xiao Liu,

32
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,820
always have someone with you.

33
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,320
That won't be necessary.

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,960
General.

35
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,740
Will the Princess disrupt our plans?

36
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,280
I just feel that

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
you've been paying more and more attention to the Princess lately.

38
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
It's because she's useful to us.

39
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,440
If the marriage alliance fails,

40
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,330
Ma Yangfei won't be able to cooperate with Beiyu.

41
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,800
And with Ma Qianqiu personally destroying the Divine Lady identity,

42
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,930
Ma Yangfei's atrocities will be impossible to conceal.

43
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
That's why he's so desperate

44
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,240
using Ping'er's case

45
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
to put pressure on Ma Qianqiu and me.

46
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,490
We can accelerate our plan now.

47
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,780
What about the Princess and Ping'er?

48
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,840
Come look at this little doll.

49
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Take a look,

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,460
please have a look.

51
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
This should be the room.

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,720
Where do you think you're going?

53
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Your mother

54
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,040
hasn't sent money for several days now.

55
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Princess.

56
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,440
You better work harder.

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
Princess, General Qin has just ordered

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
that Ping'er be executed for theft

59
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,770
and conspiracy.

60
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,080
What?

61
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
I've found the evidence.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
It's too late.

63
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
What do you mean too late?

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,440
I've already found

65
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,800
the guard who helped Ping'er transfer money multiple times.

66
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,440
He can prove

67
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,040
that Ping'er was only using her own allowance.

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,240
You.

69
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Princess,

70
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,840
the general was only following orders.

71
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,300
Please don't make things difficult for him.

72
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
Princess.

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
Actually,

74
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,700
General Qin is quite pitiful.

75
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,300
What's pitiful about him?

76
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,520
I just heard recently

77
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,240
from the palace elders

78
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,120
that General Qin's mother was once a thief.

79
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
General Qin's mother was once the city lord's maid,

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,720
but she disappeared 20 years ago.

81
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,240
Everyone said she ran away,

82
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
but three years later,

83
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,680
she returned to our Huiyin.

84
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,760
Your hands are so unclean,

85
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
how could I possibly keep you here?

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Guards! Take her away!

87
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I didn't steal it,

88
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't steal anything.

89
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,440
Lord Governor, I didn't steal anything.

90
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,240
Lord Governor, I didn't steal it.

91
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
Lord Governor!

92
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,320
As for you, you little bastard.

93
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Although most people don't know about this past,

94
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,220
there are always rumors in the palace

95
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
about General Qin...

96
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Stop talking.

97
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,920
Qin Che.

98
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,040
So you've been through all this.

99
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,060
The princess already knows everything.

100
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,890
Fang Jue has prepared everything,

101
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,920
just cooperate with him.

102
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,340
Ma Yangfei put Qin Che in charge of Ping'er's matter

103
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
just to teach him a lesson,

104
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,520
so I would work for him again.

105
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
Ma Yangfei,

106
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,920
I won't give up so easily.

107
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,490
General Qin.

108
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,770
General Qin,

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,680
let's make a deal, shall we?

110
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
By this hour,

111
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,680
Ping'er should have been beheaded already, right?

112
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,400
Princess,

113
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
everyone has their own fate.

114
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,940
Please don't grieve too much.

115
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,240
General Qin,

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,730
I was right about you all along.

117
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,740
You flatter me, Governor.

118
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,760
It's just that

119
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
I don't want this matter

120
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
to bring back any bad memories for you.

121
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,490
The City Lord is overthinking.

122
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,640
You may go now.

123
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,720
Wait.

124
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Father,

125
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,050
I have something to say.

126
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
Xinjiang Dican.

127
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,290
Xinjiang Di.

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,480
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

129
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
Lei Cai Long Yan Peng Song Hui.

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,400
Bojun.

131
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,040
Bojun.

132
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,680
Zhuangcheng.

133
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Zhuangcheng.

134
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,840
Jinsheng.

135
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,320
Danwei Pingling.

136
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,330
Miao An Hao Wang Tao Rui Kai Qing Yu.

137
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,740
Nan Zi Lei Ze Zhen Yao Zai Zhen Kai Jing Lu.

138
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Lu Ling.

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Lu Ling.

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,080
Lu Ling.
