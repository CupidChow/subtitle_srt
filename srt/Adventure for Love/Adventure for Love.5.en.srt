1
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,160
Tomorrow I'd like to host a calligraphy and painting gathering.

2
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,600
Would you accompany me to select poems and arrange everything?

3
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,460
What do you say?

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,920
The Princess has quite the enthusiasm,

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,980
but I have other matters to attend to.

6
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,250
I must take my leave.

7
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm also planning to hold

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,880
a little entertaining activity,

9
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,680
where the chosen one can share a cup of wine with me.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,960
It's just that I'm not very familiar with these things.

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,520
Could General Qin offer some guidance?

12
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,700
I have official duties

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,490
and shouldn't be drinking.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,060
Do you dislike me that much, General Qin?

15
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Wait.

16
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,480
General Qin,

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,520
I have feelings for you.

18
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,460
Though I'm reluctant to admit it,

19
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,400
ever since the day you rescued me,

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,280
my heart

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,960
has had someone new in it,

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
and I've been wishing that someday

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,900
I could stand by your side.

24
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,980
So Your Highness's love means buying trending news

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,700
to spread fake rumors?

26
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,560
Not at all.

27
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,920
It's my sincere feelings for you

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
that genuinely moved everyone,

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,770
which is why people are willing to create buzz for us.

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,610
General Qin, why care about society's judgment,

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,650
social status and background?

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,340
Aren't they all meaningless?

33
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,680
The cold, quiet, heroic general

34
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,760
and the glorious princess...

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
I've even thought of our couple name,

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,080
it's 'Immediate Retreat.'

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,720
What do you think?

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Isn't it auspicious?

39
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,120
Enough.

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,620
No matter how flowery your words are, Princess,

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,660
you're still going to that political marriage.

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,500
Luckily I slipped some knockout drops in the wine beforehand.

43
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,170
Sincerity really is the ultimate weapon.

44
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,620
Or possibly a self-destructive one.

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
I never expected

46
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
to get such a big bonus from this visit.

47
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
What did you do to me?

48
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
I should be asking you that.

49
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
You might have a point there.

50
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
But how did I fall asleep last night?

51
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
Damn it.

52
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,880
Why hasn't Xiao Liu brought people yet?

53
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,980
Never mind,

54
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,650
I'll stall for a bit longer.

55
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Fine, playing dumb now, are you?

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,450
You men are all the same.

57
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,440
Since you're not afraid,

58
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
I'll spread word about

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
everything between us

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,450
and let all of Huiyin City know.

61
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,620
What are you doing?

62
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,280
Princess.

63
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,400
Do you really care so little about your reputation?

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,320
Reputation?

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm about to marry a 60-year-old man,

66
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,260
what reputation do I have left to care about?

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,050
Don't leave!

68
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,890
I'm putting on my shoes.

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,520
Princess.

70
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,360
Princess.

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,820
Coming, Princess.

72
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,820
What are you

73
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,040
doing here?

74
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,760
By order of the City Lord,

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,480
Qin Che is suspected of assassinating Envoy Liu Yue,

76
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,080
and we're here to arrest him.

77
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,640
What? What's going on?

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Princess,

79
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
Envoy Liu Yue was arranged to rest in the side palace yesterday,

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
waiting to meet with the City Lord.

81
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,480
But unexpectedly,

82
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,159
early this morning,

83
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,320
I found the envoy's dead body.

84
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
After searching around, I discovered

85
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,760
someone resembling General Qin was seen,

86
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
which is why we came here.

87
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,040
Qin Che.

88
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,770
Finally caught you red-handed, didn't I?

89
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
If you don't want to die,

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
agree to my one condition.

91
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,520
Father.

92
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,800
This guard must not have investigated properly.

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,060
Brother Che was with me

94
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,280
the entire night yesterday.

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Princess,

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,130
that's impossible!

97
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,900
That's enough.

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,159
Qin Che,

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,520
you.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,800
You tell us,

101
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,490
what exactly happened last night?

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,760
City Lord,

103
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,840
last night I...

104
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
Brother Che wasn't with me last night.

105
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,600
Did he really go to kill Liu Yue?

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,890
I'm going to stick to you like glue.

107
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,160
I was indeed with the Princess all night

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
but I don't remember what happened.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,660
Yes, that's right.

110
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,520
Brother Che was drunk last night,

111
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
he doesn't remember anything.

112
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Actually,

113
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
he was so gentle.

114
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,440
Don't pin this on me.

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,560
You two, get away from each other!

116
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,080
Now!

117
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Father,

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,159
please let me be with Brother Che,

119
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm begging you!

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,800
Lord Mayor!

121
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Lord Mayor!

122
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,370
This is outrageous!

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,200
What happened today,

124
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
no one is allowed to mention it again.

125
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Princess, tomorrow you will obediently go to your political marriage.

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,400
I won't!

127
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,120
Princess, don't!

128
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,680
Don't!

129
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
I don't want to be separated from Brother Che!

130
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm not going,

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,560
not going!

132
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,120
Report to the City Lord.

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,880
I...

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,920
City Lord.

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Lady of the City.

136
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
News has spread throughout the city

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
about the Princess and General Qin's secret meeting.

138
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,060
North Yu City must already know about it.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,600
City Lord.

140
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,360
What?

141
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,720
You...

142
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,080
Fortunately, I already had Xiao Liu

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
pay for trending topics in advance.

144
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,840
You...

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
Father.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,660
Ruining my plans, aren't you?

147
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
You're ruining my plans.

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,770
At this point...

149
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,690
The marriage alliance with North Isle is off.

150
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,240
Since you two have feelings for each other,

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,900
you should be together

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,450
and silence the gossip.

153
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,370
Alright.

154
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,920
No.

155
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,780
This matter

156
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,800
has many suspicious aspects.

157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
The most important issue now is that the envoy was killed,

158
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,410
understand?

159
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,720
The Lord of Beiyu is not someone to be trifled with.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,760
Qin Che,

161
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
as the Divine Martial General of Huiyin,

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
you must thoroughly investigate the cause of the envoy's death

163
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
and provide Beiyu with an explanation.

164
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,970
Yes, sir.

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Father, don't worry,

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,130
he will certainly do an excellent job.

167
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Look at the mess you've made.

168
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
Let's go, my lady.

169
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,080
General Qin chased me from the palace all the way to Zui Chun Feng.

170
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
What brings you here?

171
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,330
Aren't you busy with your case?

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,330
So quickly I'm no longer your brother Che?

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
In private,

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,340
we can be more relaxed.

175
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,930
Why didn't you hide?

176
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,120
Because I was certain

177
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,010
that the Princess needs me.

178
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,460
Just as the Princess knows

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,180
she cannot escape from me.

180
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,960
That's right.

181
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,490
I not only want you to spare my life,

182
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,440
but also to eliminate all dangers for me.

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I don't want the Princess to go to such lengths

184
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
just to drag me into this.

185
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,600
But,

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
are you really prepared?

187
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,620
Prepared for what?

188
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,840
To go to hell with me.

189
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,330
Why couldn't I pull you back to the mortal world instead?

190
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,400
