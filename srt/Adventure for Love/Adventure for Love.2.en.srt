1
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,480
What

2
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,080
is this?

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Weren't you going to?

4
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,720
Ma Qianqiu is acting so strange.

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,200
Are you sure nothing unusual is happening in the royal city?

6
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,060
The east gate seems to have fewer people than usual.

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,050
I'm afraid today's plan will have to be canceled.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,730
Why hasn't Qin Che arrived yet?

9
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,210
The snowfall is causing disruptions.

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,400
Today's blessing ceremony is canceled.

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Princess,

12
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
it's snowing today,

13
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
and the city lord has canceled the blessing ceremony.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
We survived.

15
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,420
What are you doing?

16
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,760
Shouldn't the princess be asking herself that question?

17
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,780
Why have you been avoiding me?

18
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Do you think I want to kill you?

19
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,440
No.

20
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,720
I thought you and Mu Wan were deeply in love,

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,850
so I wanted to give you two my blessing.

22
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,000
What makes you say that?

23
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,640
This...

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
It fell from Mu Wan's person.

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
It seems she misunderstood.

26
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
Madam once said

27
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,570
that I resemble someone from her past,

28
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,280
perhaps this belonged to that person.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
Not a crime of passion.

30
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,920
Then why?

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Could I have misunderstood him?

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
Ma Qianqiu,

33
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,300
what exactly are you trying to do?

34
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,520
Princess.

35
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,480
It's dark and windy tonight,

36
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,200
be careful.

37
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,330
Threatening me.

38
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,600
Princess,

39
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,900
what are you doing?

40
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm running away, of course.

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,840
Qin Che failed to kill me yesterday,

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
but he'll surely try again.

43
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,010
I'm leaving.

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Wait,

45
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,770
you can't leave.

46
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
What should we do with this letter?

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,520
I don't know either.

48
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,240
It's from an admirer,

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
just leave it there.

50
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,000
No, no, no

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
this is what you asked me to give to General Qin yesterday.

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
Why cancel the plan?

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,160
You know I carry the burden of avenging my destroyed city,

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
I've been by Ma Yangfei's side for so many years,

55
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,290
just to give closure to all those innocent souls.

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,610
We were so close to success,

57
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,090
and now you're backing out.

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,540
Don't you think I hate Ma Yangfei too?

59
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,170
Ma Qianqiu suddenly changed his mind,

60
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,570
Ma Yangfei was prepared all along,

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,480
everything is against us now.

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,760
It seems

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,730
General Qin's charm offensive

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
didn't work at all.

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,840
No matter how much she loves you,

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,159
when faced with death,

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,159
she'll still back down.

68
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
To Qin Che:

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,080
That day, the wind was strong,

70
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
you grabbed my hand

71
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,080
and desperately pulled me up.

72
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,360
Let go!

73
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Look at how many people in this city

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,800
resort to despicable means just to survive.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,960
Yet here you are in fine clothes,

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,090
adored by everyone.

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,570
What right do you have to give up your life?

78
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I already know

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,820
that my entire life

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
will be sustained by these fleeting memories

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,040
and fantasies.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Kill me.

83
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,760
Only if the Divine Maiden dies

84
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
in front of the people during a grand ceremony,

85
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,880
will Ma Yangfei be unable

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,340
to use my Divine Maiden identity as a shield.

87
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,020
Then you can lead your troops to the city,

88
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,490
and it will all make perfect sense.

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,159
If this must have meaning,

90
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,640
then I wish to pray to the gods with my Divine Maiden's body.

91
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,490
In my name as the Divine Maiden,

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
I pray your wishes come true.

93
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,920
Even if you approached me with ulterior motives,

94
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,880
even if I never saw myself reflected in your eyes.

95
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,720
It seems the original host willingly sacrificed her life

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
to leave this letter behind.

97
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,560
Then there must be an even bigger conspiracy behind this.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,080
Wait.

99
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,740
If that's the case,

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,760
am I going to die too?

101
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,400
Of course you will die.

102
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,160
If she loses control,

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
your mother's death,

104
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
my hatred for losing my country,

105
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,840
we won't be able to take revenge on Ma Yangfei.

106
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,480
Master,

107
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,840
your wife is resting.

108
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
Keep your belongings safe.

109
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,900
Why are you crying?

110
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,140
Recently, North Isle sent envoys to discuss a marriage alliance.

111
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,020
Qianqiu is the Divine Maiden,

112
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,400
so I thought of Ruofei.

113
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,920
We'll send her away soon.

114
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,920
Lord,

115
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,760
you absolutely cannot do this!

116
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
Ruofei is still so young.

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,640
Since when do my decisions

118
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
require your approval?

119
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,420
With people watching,

120
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,580
I'd like to see how you'll kill me now.

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
Princess.

122
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
No need for formalities.

123
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
Why did you summon me here?

124
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
I just feel there are some misunderstandings between us

125
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,140
that need to be cleared up.

126
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,160
Is that so?

127
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,840
Please enlighten me, Princess.

128
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,540
I know you plan to kill Ma Yangfei.

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
The Princess must be joking.

130
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,970
How could I harbor such treasonous thoughts?

131
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
General Qin,

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,770
you're being no fun now.

133
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,840
I was willing to give my life for you.

134
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,040
But now,

135
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,810
I don't want to die anymore.

136
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,040
Every debt has its debtor.

137
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,840
Why don't you go after the people you really should kill?

138
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,770
Will you do that?

139
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,810
Alright.

140
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Then how can I be sure

141
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,210
that you won't leak this information?

142
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,970
Don't worry.

143
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,240
I swear,

144
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll stay far away from your feud.

145
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,220
I take my leave.

146
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,560
Take care.

147
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,140
Men's words can't be trusted,

148
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,840
running away is the best option.

149
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,040
What exactly do you want?

150
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,080
Princess.

151
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
What kind of princess am I?

152
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,680
I can't even avenge my people.

153
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,130
The fireworks display outside the city is ready.

154
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,780
Would you like to go see it?

155
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,480
Usually

156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,460
you love watching these the most, don't you?

157
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Things are different now.

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,920
Now I

159
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,560
only wish for Ruofei to grow up peacefully.

160
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,440
Ruofei.

161
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,280
No.

162
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,300
Ruofei cannot marry into Northern Isle.

163
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Xiaoyun,

164
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,440
go find Qin Che

165
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,280
and tell him

166
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,730
Ma Qianqiu must not die.

167
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,290
Alright.

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,000
Hurry.

169
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,280
Ruofei,

170
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,440
mother will protect you

171
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,580
and not let you be sent away in a political marriage.

172
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,170
Who's there?

173
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,680
You scared me to death.

174
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,140
I really don't want to die.

175
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,880
General Qin,

176
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,730
what a coincidence.

177
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,500
Where are you heading, Princess?

178
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,520
Would you mind putting me down first?

179
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,460
Do you know, Princess,

180
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
only the dead keep secrets.

181
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
I don't want to die.

182
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,240
You're not Ma Qianqiu.

183
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
Who are you?

184
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,600
Let me go!

185
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,090
Xin Jiangdi.

186
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,440
Lei, Cai, Long, Yan, Peng, Song, Hui.

187
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,840
Bo Jun.

188
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,680
Bo Jun.

189
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,160
Zhuang Cheng.

190
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,960
