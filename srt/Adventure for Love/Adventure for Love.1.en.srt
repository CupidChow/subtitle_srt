1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,820
I've admired General Qin for a long time,

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
why not become my personal advisor?

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,130
Princess, please mind your words.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,920
Isn't that so?

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
General Qin,

6
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,720
if you can be my stepmother's dog,

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,440
why can't you be mine?

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,760
If you die, Princess, I'll finally have a reason to rebel.

9
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
The sun sets behind the western mountains, darkness falls.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,680
The vast sky meets the edge of clouds.

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,600
Walking in circles on the ground, looking to the heavens,

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,320
to welcome the goddess.

13
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,410
The goddess has died suddenly,

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,160
this is a terrible omen!

15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,180
Heaven's punishment has fallen,

16
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,700
the goddess has perished,

17
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,220
all because of Ma Yangfei's tyranny.

18
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,640
Only by executing him

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,330
can we prove our righteousness to heaven.

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Restore peace to Huiyin!

21
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Restore peace to Huiyin!

22
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
Ma Yangfei!

23
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,040
Today I shall have my revenge

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
and kill that woman!

25
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
This bastard Qin Che will serve me from now on.

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,160
General,

27
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
we've fallen into a trap.

28
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
Even you betray me.

29
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Ma Yangfei.

30
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
You're cruel by nature,

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,600
killing my mother and ruining my life.

32
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
If there's another life,

33
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,079
I swear I'll

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,400
grind your bones to dust.

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Who is this man?

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
And why am I suddenly

37
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,400
in these traditional clothes?

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,000
Princess.

39
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Weren't we supposed to meet tonight?

40
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,210
Why have you come early?

41
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,440
I was wondering the same thing.

42
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
Maybe

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,730
I missed you.

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,400
Princess,

45
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,440
would you like me to come in and help you change?

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Yes, please.

47
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Princess.

48
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,340
After tonight's blessing ceremony,

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
you won't suffer like this anymore.

50
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Princess.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Princess, are you all right? Princess!

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Princess.

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Princess.

54
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,560
Princess, are you all right? Princess!

55
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Princess... Have I traveled back in time?

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,760
Princess!

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Princess!

58
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Princess?

59
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Princess!

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,730
Princess...

61
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,260
So I've taken over someone else's identity.

62
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,880
That flashback I just saw

63
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,840
must be the original owner's memories.

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,640
So I've arrived just before her death.

65
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,340
Then according to how the story goes,

66
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
that means

67
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,450
I'm going to die.

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
Princess, stop running!

69
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Princess!

70
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
Princess!

71
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,640
Princess, stop running!

72
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,620
You useless fools,

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
can't even handle such a simple task.

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Madam! Madam!

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,320
Ma Qianqiu.

76
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,090
What are you doing here?

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,240
The blessing ceremony is approaching,

78
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
yet you're still running around wildly.

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,460
Guards!

80
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,159
Take the princess back to her chambers

81
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,620
and keep a close eye on her.

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,020
Don't move.

83
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,280
I won't go.

84
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,560
By what right?

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,400
I...

86
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,500
I am the Divine Maiden.

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,159
Divine Maiden or not,

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
I am your mother.

89
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't you understand respect for your elders?

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
Mother.

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,320
Madam.

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Princess Ruofei is waiting for you.

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,640
Fine.

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,660
You are the Divine Maiden,

95
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,770
don't you forget it.

96
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,140
Your responsibility.

97
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Princess.

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,880
Princess,

99
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,280
let's go back.

100
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,010
Ma Yangfei doesn't suspect anything, right?

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,640
The Divine Maiden of Huiyin

102
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,970
inherits heaven's will

103
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,820
and is the faith of Huiyin City's people.

104
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,280
All these years,

105
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Ma Yangfei has been using the Divine Maiden

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,980
to divert the people's attention

107
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
and cover up his tyranny.

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
If during the blessing ceremony

109
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,720
the Divine Maiden suddenly dies,

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
we can claim it's heaven's will

111
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,680
and seize the opportunity to execute Ma Yangfei.

112
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Tonight,

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,840
Ma Yangfei must die.

114
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
There's no escape,

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,820
how can I avoid the original owner's fate of certain death?

116
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,720
Wait,

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
the place I'm in now

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,520
is different from the original owner's memory of being killed,

119
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,650
so I still have hope.

120
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Princess,

121
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,800
why do you have General Qin's miniature portrait?

122
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,560
I didn't see it when I helped you change clothes today,

123
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
my lady.

124
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
What is this?

125
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,360
It's not mine.

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,080
Wait.

127
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,100
Who did you say?

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
General Qin Che,

129
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,320
don't you see the resemblance in the features?

130
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,200
It's Mu Wan's.

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,820
They're having an affair.

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Isn't he with you, Princess?

133
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,760
What does that have to do with me?

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,760
These days,

135
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,840
General Qin has been secretly visiting you,

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,370
and you always send me away.

137
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Actually, I'm so afraid that this Black Rakshasa

138
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,140
might do something to you.

139
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,120
Princess,

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120
do you know?

141
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,560
Rumors say that

142
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,080
General Qin is an evil spirit who crawled up from hell.

143
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
I don't care if he's evil.

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,920
The problem now is

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,220
me and my mom...

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,080
no,

147
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
my mother and my lover are together.

148
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,580
Isn't that incest?

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,320
Actually,

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,900
the madam is not your biological mother.

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,020
So she's a stepmother.

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,850
That's why they want to kill me,

153
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
and my father too.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,640
So it's a love affair, murder, and seizing power to take over the city.

155
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,760
What... what should I do?

156
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,280
I...

157
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Princess.

158
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,280
The auspicious time is approaching.

159
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
Madam asks you to change your clothes,

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,760
Princess.

161
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,050
This is where the original owner died.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,140
I came here anyway.

163
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,080
Princess,

164
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,450
General Qin is here.

165
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Qin Che.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
So it was you who killed the original owner.

167
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,570
Since some things are bound to happen,

168
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,690
there's no point in hiding.

169
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,720
Xiao Liu,

170
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,890
please leave us.

171
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,640
Yes.

172
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,460
The blessing ceremony is about to begin,

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,420
I've come specifically to escort the Princess.

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,700
Where are you escorting me to?

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,730
The blessing ceremony or the path to the underworld?

176
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,290
What do you mean, Princess?

177
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,210
Are you having regrets?

178
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,280
No,

179
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
I just think we don't need to

180
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
solve this problem in such a cruel way.

181
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,680
I can beg my father

182
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,880
to release you and the City Lord's wife.

183
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,160
Release us?

184
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,480
Just by your request?

185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,920
We need to trick him.

186
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Actually,

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,530
he's known about you and Mu Wan for a long time.

188
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,840
That's why

189
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
I came to find you today.

190
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
How do you know?

191
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,490
I heard about it, of course.
