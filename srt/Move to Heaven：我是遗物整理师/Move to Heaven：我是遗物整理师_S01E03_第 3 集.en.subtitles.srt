1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,763
Goodness.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,518
Good grief.

3
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,900
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun

4
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,112
came by the bank
around the same time every day

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,532
and withdrew a brand-new 50,000-won bill.

6
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:39,164
She had her bankbook, ID, and stamp
and asked to withdraw 50,000 won,

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,584
so everyone at the bank knew her.

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,337
She hasn't come last few weeks,

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,341
so we thought she must have fallen ill.

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,345
This is between us,
but she seemed to have dementia.

11
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,724
She couldn't remember a thing
and always repeated what she said.

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,187
Also, she made a call every day.

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,273
I let her use the phone over there.

14
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,192
She said nothing on the phone.

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,985
She just hung up quickly and left.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,740
Hey.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,080
Kid, what on earth are you doing now?

18
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,549
-I got it now.
-Got what?

19
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,552
Come on. What?

20
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,806
May I have some?

21
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,974
Of course, go ahead.

22
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,686
Geu-ru.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,523
Man--

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,025
What the--

25
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,073
Where did he go?

26
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,158
Darn that little punk.

27
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,732
Still, how could you come home
without him?

28
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,153
I waited near the bank over an hour.
What could I do more?

29
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,866
However stupid he is,
he'd know the way home.

30
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,367
Who are you calling stupid?

31
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,245
Geu-ru is not stupid. He's special.

32
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,123
Then you got nothing to worry about.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,917
Wow, who is stupid here, really?

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,254
Being special in this world
can put you at risk.

35
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,800
Like being especially nice, innocent,
genuine, etcetera.

36
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,844
Don't you know that?

37
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,308
I know it's especially terrifying
to have a friend like you.

38
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,810
Whatever.

39
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,688
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

40
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,106
-Han Geu-ru!
-Yes!

41
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,859
-You punk!
-Geu-ru!

42
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,737
Where did you go after the bank?

43
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,198
Why didn't you answer your phone?

44
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,200
My phone died.

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,328
Keeping the map app on
makes the battery die quickly.

46
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,622
So I need to take
extra batteries tomorrow.

47
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,790
Tomorrow? Where are you going?

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,960
I must see
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun's family again.

49
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,549
Her son called again
and nagged me about the money.

50
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,886
I have things to give to them.

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,305
He said he wanted nothing but the money.

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,184
Give it to me.
I'll hand it over and be done with it.

53
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,937
-I need to do that in person.
-Aw, man.

54
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:55,151
You mean you have things
to give them in person besides the money?

55
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,404
-That's right.
-Must you do that in person?

56
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,951
It's the policy of Move to Heaven,
and we need to follow the policy.

57
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,042
See that? Now nothing can stop him.

58
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,418
That's nonsense!

59
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,713
You still don't get it, do you?

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,717
You make a call
and make sure they'll meet him.

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,718
Whatever.

62
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,222
If you're worried that much,
you call them.

63
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,059
I was going to join Move to Heaven,
starting tomorrow anyway.

64
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,108
What did you say you'd do?
Cleaning corpses?

65
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,735
Are you out of your mind?
Cleaning corpses?

66
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,238
I've been telling you
it's trauma cleaning!

67
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,614
There aren't any bodies!

68
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,034
We clean a house of the deceased,
not a body!

69
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,829
-Whatever! The same difference!
-Darn it.

70
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,998
Why the heck do you want to do that?

71
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,708
Come on, I can't believe it.

72
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,334
Of all the houses here,

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,546
they have to live across from us
and do that kind of work?

74
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,506
I've barely put up with them.

75
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,551
Plus, now Geu-ru lost his father.

76
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,721
What makes him think
he can run the business without him?

77
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,683
The world isn't as easy as you think.
Tell him to lie low and live quietly!

78
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,811
Geu-ru isn't a criminal!
Why should he lie low?

79
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,021
Honey!

80
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,897
Come look at your daughter.

81
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,317
-Are you taking his side?
-Baby.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,486
-Let me talk to her. Get inside, baby.
-Are you going insane?

83
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,323
-Who does she take after--
-Please get inside.

84
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,742
I'll make sure I put an end to this today!

85
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,662
Goodness!

86
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,461
Dad, try to put yourself
in Geu-ru's shoes.

87
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,964
He suddenly lost his dad,
and a so-called uncle has come in.

88
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,259
If I were in that situation,
how would you feel?

89
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,636
I know. I understand how you feel--

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,639
It's not like I'll work there for good.
Just for a while.

91
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,309
I'll help him only for three months!

92
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,895
No more or less.
Just for three months, please.

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,692
Let's keep this a secret from your mom.

94
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,528
If she finds out,
I can cover for you no more.

95
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,531
Okay. Don't worry. I'll be cautious.

96
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,492
Okay? You're the best dad.

97
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,829
No!

98
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,581
It's not here!

99
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,792
-It's not here!
-What?

100
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,212
Is it here?

101
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,090
No, it isn't.

102
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,258
It's not here.

103
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,054
-It's not here either.
-What's wrong? Is the house on fire?

104
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,598
-What's going on?
-It's not here.

105
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,810
It's not here.
I've looked everywhere, but it's not here.

106
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,187
-What?
-I surely put it there,

107
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,563
so it should be there.

108
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,817
-But it's not.
-What's missing that you go nuts over?

109
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,529
-The heart.
-What?

110
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,824
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun's heart is in that box.

111
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,784
I have to give it to her family,

112
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,994
but I can't do that without the box.

113
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,831
Her heart is gone!

114
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,707
-I lost the heart.
-Hey!

115
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,918
-I shouldn't have lost it.
-Stop it!

116
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,711
-Cut it out!
-I shouldn't--

117
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,381
You little punk,
I told you to stop, didn't I?

118
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,216
-I can't believe it.
-Don't!

119
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,887
Next door, come here and stop him.

120
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,305
What are you doing?

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,099
Let him go!

122
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,309
-Let him go now!
-Next door, what's wrong?

123
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,774
I knew it!

124
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,110
You're hurting him already
in just a few days?

125
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,572
You knew he couldn't fight back,
so you've abused him like this?

126
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,824
How dare you lay a hand on him?

127
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,744
Stay right there. I'm reporting you
to the police for assault.

128
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,705
I didn't abuse him!

129
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,081
And assault?

130
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,251
Look! This is assault. That wasn't!

131
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,421
Geu-ru, are you okay? Did he hit you?

132
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,340
-I lost the box. The box is gone!
-What?

133
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,468
-The box is gone!
-Don't do it!

134
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,386
-Please stop.
-What a nutjob!

135
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,682
He's making a darn fuss
over finding some kind of box.

136
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,559
So I was trying to stop him.

137
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,686
Gosh, what the heck is wrong with you?

138
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,188
Oh no!

139
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,107
Hey! Just cut it out, darn it!

140
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,275
A box? What box?

141
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,821
It's the yellow box
from Ms. Lee Yeong-sun's house.

142
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,200
35 cm in width, 25 cm in length,
and 20 cm in height.

143
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,621
You mean a yellow box
with "Move to Heaven" written on the lid?

144
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,125
I put it in our van, but it's gone.

145
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,252
The box can't move on its own.

146
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,506
-The impossible has happened!
-Don't!

147
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,424
Why are you looking for it?

148
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,469
It's the garbage
even the family didn't want.

149
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,555
It's not garbage.
It's absolutely necessary.

150
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,560
Hey, where are you going?

151
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,938
There's only one way
the box could be missing.

152
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,733
It must've fallen off on the way home.

153
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,276
So,

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,031
if I retrace our way from Ms. Lee's house,
I may find it.

155
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,451
Are you saying you go looking for it now?

156
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,370
I must leave now.

157
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,080
Kid, are you out of your mind?

158
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,874
Someone must've taken it already.

159
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,335
Even if you went there,
it'd be gone already.

160
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,337
So, you know,

161
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,964
just give up.

162
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,218
People with Asperger's syndrome
don't know how to give up.

163
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,845
Once he is fixated on something,
he must do it.

164
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,556
What nonsense.

165
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,641
Geu-ru, I'll go with you, okay?

166
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,148
Don't go. You won't find it there.

167
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,194
-How do you know?
-How do you know, Uncle?

168
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,737
I just know.

169
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,155
-Uncle Sang-gu!
-Uncle!

170
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,241
I know because I tossed it away!

171
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,285
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

172
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,998
Wow, you sure are good at causing trouble.

173
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,502
Her family said it was garbage, so I just

174
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,171
naturally disposed of it.

175
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,716
Man, I can't believe this.

176
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,511
A box? What box?

177
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,638
You mean the yellow one?

178
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,974
That's the one. Have you seen it?

179
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,684
Yeah, I've been wondering

180
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,439
how it ended up on my truck
since Mr. Han took special care of it.

181
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,650
-So, you didn't throw it away, right?
-You shouldn't do that!

182
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:15,197
I shouldn't? Man, I'm just returning
from a dumpsite.

183
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,200
No!

184
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,585
Shit!

185
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,349
This is downright crazy!

186
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,269
I can't believe we're rummaging
through garbage to find garbage.

187
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,856
-Darn it.
-He said it's not garbage.

188
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,985
I don't know exactly,
but it seems like a special box

189
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,280
where Uncle Jeong-u put items
that he couldn't just throw away.

190
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,948
She's right.

191
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,369
Mr. Han never gave me that box.

192
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,579
He said he later burned it separately.

193
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,749
Geu-ru wants to do things
the way his father did.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,711
So it's garbage after all
if you burn it later.

195
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,589
And even the family didn't want it.

196
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,093
Why do we have to go through
so much trouble? I can't believe it.

197
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,389
Do you really not know
who has caused all this?

198
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,891
What a nerve! Super brazen for real!

199
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,018
Man, it hurts!

200
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:26,936
Still,

201
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,816
it's good that I tossed it out today,
not yesterday.

202
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,319
Otherwise, we'd dig into this mountain
for four days non-stop.

203
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,737
Oh boy.

204
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,325
Goodness.

205
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,956
Man, I can't believe this is happening.

206
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,219
This is totally insane.

207
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,179
Shit.

208
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,809
Han Jeong-u, are you happy now?

209
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,311
Darn it!

210
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,361
Damn it!

211
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,947
Fuck this! Ouch!

212
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,450
Man.

213
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,702
My back.

214
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,459
MOVE TO HEAVEN

215
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,793
I-- I found it.

216
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,796
I found it!

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,047
Right here!

218
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,927
-Found it!
-That's--

219
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,721
I found it!

220
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,658
I'll carry it for you.

221
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,497
KOREA FEDERATION OF COMMUNITY
CREDIT COOPERATIVES

222
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,167
You could've just sent the money.
Why do I have to be here too?

223
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,002
Is this it?

224
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,424
If she had this much in cash,
she must've spent loads of money.

225
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,885
What's this?

226
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,053
That's not true.

227
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,389
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun did not spend the money.

228
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,309
-What?
-She did not spend the money.

229
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,439
Ms. Lee visited
the Sang-dong branch of KFCC

230
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,776
every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday at 2:00 p.m.

231
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,736
SANJEONG-RO 51-4

232
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,031
Sangdong Branch of KFCC
is the nearest bank from her house.

233
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,783
KFCC, SANG-DONG BRANCH

234
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,285
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun

235
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,662
WITHDRAWAL RECEIPT

236
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,747
withdrew 50,000 won a day from the bank.

237
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,045
From October 2nd, 2019
to March 30th, 2020,

238
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,715
she withdrew 50,000 won each time,
a total of 123 times.

239
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,803
And we found 123 bills in total
under her linoleum.

240
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,806
Then she always called

241
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,476
010-869-5267
at the bank information desk.

242
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,230
Darn, who is it?

243
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,233
Stop making a prank call at this hour.

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,782
I didn't want to know any of these.
Who asked you to snoop around?

245
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,033
Just give me the money.

246
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,915
-I can't!
-What the--

247
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,792
I have something else to give you.

248
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,838
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun's son, Mr. Park Cheol-u,

249
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,841
you must come with me.

250
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,926
What are you playing at?

251
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,803
Just give me the money.

252
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,846
Come with me!

253
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,930
-Let go of it!
-No!

254
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,890
What the--

255
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,103
Enough! You think I'm a pushover
since I came here as I was told?

256
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,731
How dare you try to boss me around!

257
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,566
-Take it easy.
-What is this?

258
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,067
You got to cut it out too.

259
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,486
You shouldn't lay a hand on a kid.

260
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,531
What? Hey, stop right there!

261
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,325
Seriously?

262
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,911
Goodness.

263
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,041
Hey, stop right there!

264
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,045
-Hey!
-Little punk!

265
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,598
Hey, stop!

266
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,624
What?

267
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,337
Gosh.

268
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,465
Hey!

269
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,592
Man, I can't believe it.

270
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
What? What's wrong?

271
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,519
What are you doing?

272
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,437
You got to run!

273
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,898
No!

274
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,526
You punk, how dare you make a fool of me!

275
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,735
Give me my money!

276
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,070
-Let him go first.
-Shit.

277
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,655
-Just give it to him.
-No!

278
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,323
-Give it to me, jerk!
-No!

279
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,325
-Give him the money already!
-No!

280
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,703
-It's for Mr. Park Cheol-u's suit.
-Do it now!

281
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,371
-I can't!
-Let go!

282
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,373
It is for Mr. Park Cheol-u's suit.

283
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,083
Mr. Park Cheol-u?

284
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,167
Just give it to him.

285
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,838
Is your name Park Cheol-u?

286
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,425
Yes.

287
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,806
You have your mother's eyes.

288
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,664
Do you like it?

289
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,670
Whom do you want to buy it for?
Your husband?

290
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,049
For my son.

291
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,176
Cheol-u, Park Cheol-u.

292
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,970
Come by with him.
I'll get you a good deal.

293
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,182
How much do these suits cost?

294
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,101
Good ones are expensive.
Okay ones are less than that.

295
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,065
But for you,
I'll give a nice one at a good price.

296
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,650
I like this one.

297
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,778
I'll take it.

298
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,782
Then come by with your son sometime.

299
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,453
Don't sell this to anybody, okay?

300
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,456
I'll come back tomorrow.
I have lots of money.

301
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,875
I'll withdraw some from a bank.

302
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,835
Deal. I won't sell it to anyone.

303
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,254
You promised, okay?

304
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,883
Let me bring my son quickly.

305
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,890
She came here Monday through Friday

306
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,769
and said the same thing every time.

307
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,731
Your mother really wanted

308
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,734
to get you a suit.

309
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,320
Please stop by when you have time.

310
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,324
I'd really like to make you a good one.

311
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,369
Thank you for sharing the story,

312
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,580
but I don't need a suit.

313
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,334
She's dead now,
so whatever I do with the money

314
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,086
is up to me, right?

315
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,173
Geu-ru,

316
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,635
it's time to give him the money back.

317
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,648
You punk, who do you think you are?

318
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,359
Why are you
getting on my nerves like this?

319
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,405
What's all this?
I told you to trash them, damn it!

320
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,325
I don't want to pretend to be a good son
nor to learn anything about her.

321
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,079
Don't you understand Korean?
Are you listening to anything I say?

322
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,884

324
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,402
I don't--

325
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,071
I don't understand.

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,533
It's been ages.

327
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,538

priced 7,900 won.

329
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,753

"December 28th, 1988.
The day my son got his first paycheck."

332
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,518
Have more soup.

333
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,651
Wear this.

334
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,861
What is it?

335
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh my.

336
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,662
Goodness.

337
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,373
Isn't this really expensive?

338
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,793
Son, you really didn't have to.

339
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
Goodness.

340
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,385
Wow, it's so soft.

341
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,512
It must be so warm.

342
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,515
Isn't it expensive? How much did you pay?

343
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,186
Gosh, I saw the ad for this on TV,
so it must be expensive.

344
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,399
Goodness, I can't wear it.
It's too precious.

345
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,362
I couldn't get you a suit
for your first job.

346
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,323
I'm too ashamed to put this on as a mom.

347
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,827
Will you stop already?
Shall I just throw it out, then?

348
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,829
No way.

349
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,289
I'll wear it.

350
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,333
I'll wear it till it's all worn and torn.

351
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,464
Son, let's get you a good suit
next spring.

352
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,094
I'll make sure to get you one
even if I have to borrow money.

353
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,015
Goodness.

354
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,144
So pretty.

355
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,990
DECEMBER 28TH, 1988
THE DAY MY SON GOT HIS FIRST PAYCHECK

356
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,992
That damn old woman.

357
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,618
Damn it.

358
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,830
Why are you doing this to me?

359
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,405
You know, a suit
with those creases on the front

360
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,117
and a silk pocket square
in the chest pocket.

361
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,244
The kind that looks like a navy uniform.

362
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,499
You'd look really stunning in that.

363
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,669
What if all the girls at the factory
chase my handsome boy?

364
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,925
Wow, it's so pretty.

365
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,971
Eat up, all right?

366
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,364
Goodness, I really don't understand.

367
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,576
Geu-ru.

368
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,872
I understand how you found out
about the withdrawal and the calls.

369
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,084
But how did you figure out
she went to the tailor's?

370
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,295
She wrote down her wish.

371
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,007
"Wrote down her wish"? On where?

372
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,944
FOR MY SON'S SUIT

373
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,950
THE LATE HAN JEONG-U

374
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,084
Yes, you will do a wonderful job, Geu-ru.

375
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,337
Do I get rewarded for solving it?

376
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,297
TAILOR SHOP

377
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,506
Sure.

378
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,469
If you solve it right,
they'd appreciate it very much,

379
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,971
and I'll reward you on their behalf

380
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,974
with your favorite prize, "Excellent job."

381
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,518
WINCHESTER TAILOR SHOP

384
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,367
Do you like it?

385
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,384
GIVE YOUR HEART TO LOVED ONES

386
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,604
I can read their mind too.

387
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,531
"Excellent job."

388
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,616
I want to have that prize.

389
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:47,379
I LOVE YOU

390
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,794
Oh no. It's my fault.

391
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,713
-I'm sorry.
-Shut it.

392
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,340
Shut the fuck up, you bitch!

393
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,758
How dare you run away!

394
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,011
-Do you want to fucking die?
-No--

395
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,809
What's your problem?

396
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,978
-Let's just go, please.
-Fuck!

397
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,981
Come here.

398
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,049
How did you find me here?

399
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,802
Just get in the car.

400
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,034
What was that?

401
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,410
What did I see just now?

402
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,621
He has a girlfriend?

403
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,295
It'll be a quick warm-up.

404
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,134
DISCLAIMER

405
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,845
If I keep Su-cheol alive,
you said you'd do anything.

406
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,669
CHO SANG-GU

407
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,550
Kill him!

408
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,509
Bring it on!

409
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,448
Come at me!

410
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,368
Get up.

411
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,193
Uncle is not home.

412
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,571
Then did he stay out all night?

413
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,825
I don't know when he went out.

414
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,081
Wow, leading a promiscuous life is
such minus points as a guardian.

415
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,377
How do you know
he's leading a promiscuous life?

416
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,051
Goodness, it's so obvious.

417
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:50,014
They meet in the dark
and exchange lustful eye contact.

418
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,017
Then what would they do?
Chit chatting? Greeting?

419
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,312
They'd skip everything
and get right into the action.

420
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,315
And we call it an erotic noir film.

421
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,721
That's the genre.

422
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,599
I didn't know Uncle was filming a movie.

423
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,435
I'm filming what now?

424
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,813
Oh my. Your face--

425
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,148
Never seen a face before?

426
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,567
It's all squashed. You must see a doctor.

427
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm calling 911.

428
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,070
Hey, keep it down. My head is ringing.

429
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,530
-But--
-Hey, next door.

430
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,243
Make a ramyeon for me.

431
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,329
Throw an egg, too.

432
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,914
Sure.

433
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,794
Careful.

434
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,173
Be gentle, will you?

435
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,926
-It's the right way to do it.
-It hurts.

436
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,944
Yes, this is Move to Heaven.

437
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,535
NA-MU'S CHICKEN BOWL

438
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,247
Yoon Na-mu! Where are you going?

439
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,918
I just have some errands to run.

440
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,380
Errands at this early hour?

441
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,299
-If you go to Geu-ru's again--
-No, I won't.

442
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,217
Your backpack.

443
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,134
What for?

444
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,803
"What for?" Here is what for.

445
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,098
I need to know
what my only daughter is up to.

446
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,349
A random checkup. Now.

447
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,976
What about my privacy?

448
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,019
Not as long as you live under my roof.

449
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,106
I can inspect your belongings
whenever I want to

450
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,483
because my home is under my dictatorship.

451
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,609
-Gosh!
-Come on.

452
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,361
What's in here?

453
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,863
-Darn it.
-Why is it so heavy?

454
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,247
Isn't it--

455
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,709
Seriously?

456
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,044
CIVIL SERVANT ENGLISH EXAM WORKBOOK

457
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,632
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,428
Well, I'd feel pressured if you knew.

459
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,805
Most of people fail
due to stiff competition.

460
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,058
I can't believe you made a decision
like this. I'm proud of you.

461
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,435
Oh my, I'm so happy.

462
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,145
I'm so proud of my little girl.

463
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,272
I heard even college graduates

464
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:48,192
end up in Noryangjin Exam Village.
But you go straight there.

465
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,529
It's better to skip college
and get a head start by a few years.

466
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,615
Okay, let me pack you some lunch.

467
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,659
No need. I'll get something to eat.

468
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,536
-Really?
-Yes.

469
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,288
Okay, then.

470
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,123
Don't get junk food.

471
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,168
Get yourself something nutritious,
delicious and hearty.

472
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,920
Wow, what's going on here?

473
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,715
Is it my little girl's birthday today?

474
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,259
Yeong-su, my honey.

475
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,888
Our daughter is going for a civil servant.

476
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,557
-The most secure job in Korea.
-Oh, is she now?

477
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,642
It's not just a regular job.

478
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,937
She'll get paid for life
with a pension plan. A dream job.

479
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,356
I can't believe it.

480
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,067
-I'll get going.
-Of course.

481
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,694
Na-mu, study hard!
You got this! All right?

482
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,491
Study hard.

483
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,617
Stop!

484
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,328
Gosh, you startled me!

485
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,373
Do you have a death wish?

486
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,502
Are you leaving
without waiting for me five minutes?

487
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,669
So coldhearted.

488
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,380
It was 11 minutes and 39 seconds.

489
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,259
Aren't you supposed to study
for civil service exams?

490
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,552
This isn't Noryangjin.

491
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,680
Geu-ru, where are we heading?

492
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,842
Yoon Na-mu!

493
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,885
Uh? Jun-yeong?

494
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,140
What are you doing here?

495
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,183
Well,

496
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,436
I'm working with Geu-ru.

497
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,147
I see.

498
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,940
Geu-ru, it's been a while.

499
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,489
Right, this is Geu-ru's uncle.

500
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,326
This is my neighborhood friend
slash a police officer.

501
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,413
Can we go up to the scene?

502
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,456
Sure. Come follow me.

503
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,043
But Na-mu, can you handle this?

504
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,837
Handle what?

505
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,896
-Shit!
-It's a murder scene.

506
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,408
About two weeks ago,

507
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,703
a female in her twenties
was killed in this apartment.

508
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,748
Was it a robbery gone bad?

509
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,753
No, her ex-boyfriend came,
and then they got into a fight.

510
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,088
I heard of it.

511
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,717
So this is where it happened?

512
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,513
This scene must be important.
Is it okay to clean it up already?

513
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,892
As for a crime scene,

514
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,687
after necessary evidence is all collected,
we can start to clean up

515
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,607
by a request
of either the family or the police.

516
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,445
He's right. We've taken photos
and gathered enough evidence.

517
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,616
The suspect called it in and confessed,
and we got the weapon,

518
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,577
so there's not much to investigate.

519
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,582
I've worked on several crime scenes
with my dad.

520
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,001
We'll begin right away.

521
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,674
-Na-mu.
-Yes?

522
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,635
Can we talk for a second?

523
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,516
What's going on?

524
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,227
I heard you dropped out of college,

525
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,062
and now you're working with Geu-ru?

526
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,189
And trauma cleaning of all things?

527
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,151
Geu-ru's dad recently passed away.

528
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,570
Oh no, I see.

529
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,239
I didn't know.

530
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,992
Geu-ru just started working alone.

531
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,995
I'm helping temporarily
in case he runs into trouble.

532
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,832
Oh, it's just me being nosy.

533
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:16,419
Geu-ru is doing a perfect job,
so you got nothing to worry about.

534
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,590
-What's with the stare?
-Nothing.

535
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,218
You haven't changed a bit.

536
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,013
-What do you mean?
-Never mind.

537
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,851
Oh, if you run into problems at the scene,
feel free to call me.

538
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:36,105
Whoa, Officer Park.
You just sounded a bit cool.

539
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,815
See you later, then.

540
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,549
Here's the latest news
on the murder of Lee,

541
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,136
a female in her twenties
stabbed to death in her apartment, Seoul.

542
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,389
The police concluded
that Kim's actions were self-defense

543
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,518
and sent the case to the prosecution,
recommending non-indictment.

544
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,399
Kim, who turned himself in at the scene,
is the victim's ex-fiance.

545
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,194
The police concluded
that the incident took place

546
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,738
on the spur of the moment
during their argument.

547
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,043
Ms. Lee Seon-yeong,

548
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,089
you passed away on April 20th, 2020.

549
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,219
I'm Han Geu-ru, a trauma cleaner

550
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,930
from Move to Heaven.

551
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,933
From now,

552
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,978
I'll begin to help you
with your final move.

553
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,283
