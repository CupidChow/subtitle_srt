00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
HAN JEONG-U, TRAUMA CLEANER

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,055
SANG-GU'S OLDER BROTHER!
MAKE SURE THEY MEET!

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,148
You're such a fool.

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,575
I heard about Su-cheol.

5
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,952
When will you be here?

6
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,705
-No more of that.
-What?

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,500
I won't fight on the ring anymore.

8
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,585
Who says you have a choice?

9
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,212
Says me.

10
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,005
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,841
I'll pay off the debt,

12
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,094
but I won't fight anymore.

13
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,930
If you don't show up,
we'll all go down together.

14
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,431
That sounds even better.

15
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,443
ONE MESSAGE FROM UNCLE CHO SANG-GU

16
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,406
What?

17
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,413
He hasn't come home last few days.

18
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,290
Skipping work without notice?

19
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,544
He surely doesn't have
any sense of responsibility.

20
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,380
If I were his boss,
he'd be fired right away.

21
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,799
No!

22
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,302
We're in big trouble!

23
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:01,931
What was that?

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,808
Did something pass by?

25
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,728
Yes, it was your daughter
who's faster than Usain Bolt.

26
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,898
No, you can't!

27
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,609
Why? What's going on? What trouble?

28
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,027
Uncle--

29
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,028
What about him?

30
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,155
He ran away from home.

31
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,114
What?

32
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,660
DON'T WAIT FOR ME
I'M NOT COMING BACK

33
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,746
Let's find him.

34
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,748
Let's call the police.

35
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,876
He's not a kid.
They won't take it seriously.

36
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,503
Then what should we do?

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,588
Here's what.

38
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,298
We move on without him.

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,467
I can't accept that.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,593
Why not?

41
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,929
When a family is missing,
we try to find them.

42
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,223
We can't just move on without him.

43
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,100
But how? Do you know anything about him?

44
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,518
No, I don't.

45
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,062
Do you?

46
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,772
Hey, how would I…?

47
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,987
No! I don't know anything.

48
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,289
PORORO BAND-AID FOR KIDS

49
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,709
LOOKING FOR MY MISSING UNCLE

50
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,628
LAST SEEN ON JUNE 7TH
FILTHY, LOUD, GOOD AT FIGHTING

51
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,975
CONTACT IF YOU'VE SEEN HIM

52
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,412
What?

53
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh no.

54
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,207
Don't.

55
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,124
No!

56
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,306
MISSED CALLS: GEU-RU, NA-MU, MADAM

57
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,153
MADAM: YOUR NEPHEW IS LOOKING FOR YOU

58
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,661
Fuck.

59
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,291
Damn it.

60
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,170
Darn it.

61
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,673
Fuck, who cares?

62
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,427
Break time is over. Get back to work!

63
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,225
…between the eyes is flat.

64
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,812
It has a line of sharp barbs
on the body disc, extending to the tail.

65
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,273
The line falls gradually from the head…

66
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,650
-The front edge--
-Turn the darn lights on!

67
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,071
Hello, ma'am.

68
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,711
Your uncle

69
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
will be here.

70
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,840
Do you mean it?

71
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,760
If you lie, you'll go to hell
and eat 3,000 needles a day.

72
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,637
I read it in the book.

73
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,681
Yes, I mean it.

74
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,351
Are you my uncle's friend?

75
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,563
You can say that.

76
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,113
I think your uncle is here.

77
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,450
I won't have to

78
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,661
eat those needles, right?

79
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,545
Uncle!

80
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,255
What are you?

81
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,802
What the fuck?

82
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,097
-Out of the way!
-Leave him alone.

83
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,558
Uncle!

84
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,185
Geu-ru.

85
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:41,854
Geu-ru.

86
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,066
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

87
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,777
-What the heck is this?
-Uncle!

88
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,155
Don't be mad.

89
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,325
Your lady friend there isn't a bad person.

90
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,792
Were you really going to cut ties
and go off the grid?

91
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,171
I never knew Cho Sang-gu could

92
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,507
do such things.

93
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,593
I promised myself when I buried Su-cheol.

94
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,804
I won't fight again.

95
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,726
I'm sorry that he died.

96
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,061
However,

97
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,522
a promise is a promise.

98
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,856
What if I keep refusing?

99
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,151
I wasn't sure what to do
since Su-cheol died,

100
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,319
but luckily,

101
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,155
I've found your new Achilles' heel.

102
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,328
Taking him here was a test drive,
and I found the result very satisfactory.

103
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,128
He has nothing to do with me.

104
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,006
Is that why you got here so quickly?

105
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,342
His dad was my mortal enemy.

106
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,386
You'd actually do me a favor

107
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,138
if you hurt him.

108
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,015
Just keep your promise.

109
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,101
I don't want to go as low
as hurting a kid.

110
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,822
Fine. But you'll have to return

111
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,117
the house deed and the note
I signed last time.

112
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,035
No.

113
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,703
On the game night,

114
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,414
come here and take them yourself.

115
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,547
What are you doing?

116
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,008
Let's go home now.

117
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,806
Gosh.

118
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,849
Where is he?

119
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:45,936
Geu-ru!

120
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,605
Where have you been?

121
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,982
I've found Uncle.

122
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,152
Gosh, what the heck?

123
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,030
You're his guardian.
How can you go MIA for days?

124
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,449
What kind of guardian are you?

125
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,201
You know what a guardian means?

126
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,663
You're supposed to protect
and take care of Geu-ru. Get it?

127
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,789
Gosh.

128
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,292
Everyone is responsible
for their own life.

129
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,628
Looking out for someone?

130
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,546
There's no such thing.

131
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,841
Darn it.

132
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,135
Because you're all he's got.

133
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,560
For Geu-ru, you are

134
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,521
the only family he has.

135
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,447
LOOKING FOR MY MISSING UNCLE

136
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,118
This is a violation of my image rights!

137
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,539
There are better photos than this.

138
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,519
I watered the plant while you were gone.

139
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,565
I'm glad you're home.

140
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,278
Geu-ru.

141
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,113
Yes?

142
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,073
This isn't my home.

143
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,951
And I'm not your family either.

144
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,871
So if I ever disappear again,

145
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,751
never go looking for me.

146
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,961
Don't wander around alone.

147
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,714
If strangers try to take you away again,

148
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,926
call Na-mu or the cop friend immediately.

149
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,012
Got it?

150
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,726
Won't you come and get me, Uncle?

151
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,401
No.

152
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,070
Never.

153
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,299
Bring everyone.

154
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,303
Let's up the ante.

155
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,347
That's right.

156
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,599
We should go all in this time.

157
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,318
PLEDGE
NAME: CHO SANG-GU

158
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,284
MOVE TO HEAVEN

159
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,455
Are you really going?

160
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,498
Yes, I am.

161
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,250
Do you have to? Without your dad?

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,835
Yes, I do.

163
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,088
Then, let's go tomorrow with me.

164
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,965
No, I need to go today.

165
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,759
Then take your uncle with you.

166
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,760
I can't.

167
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,762
I have to go alone.

168
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
Wow, I can't believe it.

169
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,932
Are you serious?

170
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,934
This trip is only for me and Dad.

171
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,228
Now that Dad isn't here,
I need to go alone

172
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,563
with no one else.

173
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,898
That's that for today.

174
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,672
Every year this time,
Geu-ru went on a picnic with his dad.

175
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,924
A picnic? Where did they go?

176
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,468
Beats me.

177
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,471
If you're worried that much,
why don't you follow him?

178
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,307
I wish I could,

179
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,310
but I can't get away
from my mom today, so…

180
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,269
So?

181
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,271
-You should follow him.
-Me?

182
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,611
See you later.

183
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,404
Sure, see you.

184
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,488
Have fun.

185
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,204
A guardian always puts
their ward's safety first.

186
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,998
-Remember?
-What now?

187
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,292
I don't want to!

188
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,127
I'm not going. What's with you?

189
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,965
Never get distracted

190
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:25,883
nor get caught.

191
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,635
Come on.

192
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,303
-Go!
-Shoot.

193
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,808
Transferring.

194
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,560
Right.

195
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,147
How much? Here.

196
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,276
Transferring.

197
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,905
What the…?

198
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,740
So it's really a picnic, after all.

199
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,565
Why is he just watching?

200
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,045
No way.

201
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,922
Is he going to check all the rides here?

202
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,637
It's 1,800 won.

203
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,389
What is he buying?

204
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,183
Thank you.

205
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,568
No.

206
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
Let me do it.

207
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,905
-No way.
-Come on.

208
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,073
Let me do it!

209
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,365
What's with you?

210
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,037
You shouldn't leave the water running
in public places.

211
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,705
Water is public property.

212
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,167
What?

213
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,252
What did this loser say just now?

214
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,921
Who are you to try to teach us?

215
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,258
No smoking is allowed on the premises,
and minors shouldn't smoke.

216
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,718
Smoking harms your health.

217
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,096
It causes lung, larynx and oral cancer,

218
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,515
heart disease, stroke,
and sexual dysfunction.

219
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,058
What's your freaking deal?

220
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,435
Are you a robot?
What's wrong with your tone?

221
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,270
Maybe an AI robot from a movie?

222
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,898
He might be a machine
covered with human skin.

223
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,275
Hey, let's strip him down.

224
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,362
Wow, hold on. It gets fucking fun.
Give me your cigarette.

225
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,781
No, you shouldn't. This is wrong!

226
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,740
Dad!

227
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,117
-Don't move!
-Dad!

228
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,202
-Dad!
-He's looking for his daddy.

229
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,745
Why not your mommy?

230
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,413
Don't do this!

231
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,082
-Stay still.
-Please don't.

232
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,333
This is wrong!

233
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,128
-Don't do this. Please stop.
-Stay still, shit.

234
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,881
-The police. Freeze!
-Did someone call?

235
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,137
Bottom skate…

236
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,223
-Gosh, it reeks of cigarettes.
-…Chordata, Animalia.

237
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,142
-Its cartilage in…
-Are you okay?

238
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,977
Its head and pectoral fin…

239
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,855
No police after us?

240
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,316
Shit.

241
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,986
You've been told it's a smoking-free zone.

242
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,363
Gosh, who the heck are you?

243
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,117
What's up with you?

244
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,035
Fuck!

245
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,288
Shit!

246
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,841
Give me all your cigarettes.
Ten slaps for each you're hiding.

247
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,723
The boy in the bathroom

248
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,975
is not a robot. He's a genius.

249
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,606
He's ten times smarter
than all of your brains put together.

250
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,650
He's also older than you.
You should respect him.

251
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,902
Understand?

252
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,237
What did he say to you?

253
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,115
About the diseases you get from smoking.

254
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
He taught you, right? Say them.

255
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,243
Lung cancer!

256
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,453
It's lung cancer, sir.

257
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,997
Larynx cancer and oral cancer.

258
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,915
What else?

259
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,958
Already forgot?

260
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,003
-Will some beating help you remember?
-Sexual…

261
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,379
Sexual dysfunction.

262
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,631
That's right.

263
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,799
Keep smoking if you want.

264
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,096
We can say it's a way to protect the earth
not to have your kids in the world

265
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,265
who will take after you.

266
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,727
Aw.

267
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,239
Hooray!

268
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,993
Uncle!

269
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,871
What are you doing here? Why are you here?

270
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,666
-Did you follow me?
-Me?

271
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,001
No. I came here to have fun.

272
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,213
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

273
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,506
Is this place all yours?

274
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,299
-No, it's not.
-Hey!

275
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,301
The Space Fighter! Let's try that one!

276
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,679
Oh no!

277
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,555
No way! I can't ride in it!

278
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,268
You'll know whether you can or not
after you try it.

279
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
Have you tried it? It's not a big deal.

280
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,397
I haven't, and I won't!

281
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,773
I can't!

282
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,234
Frankly speaking,

283
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:19,903
I haven't either.

284
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:22,614
Let's go!

285
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,324
No way! No!

286
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,160
That's right. It's going up!

287
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,537
Doesn't it feel good?

288
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,622
Feel the wind.

289
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,666
Wow!

290
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
Come on.

291
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,837
Geu-ru, just once.

292
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,588
Open your eyes for just a second.

293
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,340
Please just for a second.

294
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,610
How is it?

295
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,279
Isn't it awesome?

296
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,339
Yes!

297
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,986
This is the last ride.

298
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,238
We have to get on it.

299
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,866
Another? Why don't we just go home?

300
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,827
No.

301
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,205
This day has to end with me and Dad
riding on the merry-go-round.

302
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,463
All right, let's go home now.

303
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
You go home, Uncle.

304
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,010
What? You're not coming?

305
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,803
I got things to do alone.

306
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,222
What? Can I go with you?

307
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,139
No, you can't.

308
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,892
I'm going by myself from here.

309
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,310
Don't follow me, Uncle.

310
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,647
Okay, then.

311
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm hanging out here longer.

312
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,275
All right, see you at home.

313
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,617
Ungrateful brat.
I kept you company all day long.

314
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,120
You might get in trouble again
if you're alone.

315
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm wasting my precious time.

316
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,352
CHICKEN

317
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,230
Yes, it's about time to eat.

318
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,568
Man, I'm starving.

319
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:16,866
Oh no.

320
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,036
Huh?

321
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,246
What?

322
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,165
He's having pizza after chicken?

323
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,292
Oh boy.

324
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,590
A Chinese restaurant? Now?

325
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,384
Is he filming mukbang or what?

326
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,344
Unbelievable.

327
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,180
Is he bulimic?

328
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,267
CHINESE RESTAURANT

329
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,814
Oh man!

330
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,905
Where is that food fighter going now?

331
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,191
Where are we?

332
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,805
YEAR 1994

333
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,355
DO NOT CROSS THE DANGEROUS TRACKS

334
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,818
Ta-da!

335
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,611
Wow!

336
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,251
-Did you make a wish?
-I forgot!

337
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,587
Come on. Close your eyes and make a wish.

338
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,424
I don't know what to wish for first.

339
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,678
You can wish
for what you want for your birthday.

340
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,763
I have tons! Can I wish for everything?

341
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,849
Sure, why not?

342
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,101
What do you want to do?

343
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,311
Well, my first wish is

344
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,482
to go to an amusement park
and try every single ride there.

345
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,443
Every ride in the park?

346
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,154
Yes, and I want to have chicken and pizza.

347
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,531
Well, and also…

348
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,324
Another food after that?

349
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,076
We have to have jajangmyeon too.

350
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,413
You want to eat them all in one day?

351
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,707
Yes, we can't leave anything out.

352
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,043
-Is that all?
-Far from it.

353
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,962
I need to get a birthday gift.

354
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,006
Okay, let's go over this.

355
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,176
You'll go to a park
and eat all those foods. Now a gift too?

356
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,387
Without getting a gift,
it's just a picnic, not a birthday.

357
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,222
Got it.

358
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,267
So, what kind of gift
would you like to have?

359
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,189
Let go.

360
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,440
Jeong-u gave it to me.

361
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,859
It's my birthday gift!

362
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,737
Nobody is happy
with a cockroach like you being born.

363
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,031
Give it to me.

364
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,824
-Let go, you brat!
-Stop!

365
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,579
-Please stop.
-Shit.

366
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,748
Your mom is dead now.

367
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,583
Why are you still here? Get out.

368
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,751
Get out!

369
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,794
What about Sang-gu?

370
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,921
He's my fucking son. Beat it now!

371
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,006
Get lost, you punk!

372
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,341
I said, get lost!

373
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,967
Jeong-u, don't go.

374
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,136
-I'll be back for you shortly.
-Hey!

375
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,387
-Take me with you!
-Out!

376
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,347
-Sang-gu!
-Out!

377
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,974
-Jeong-u!
-Get lost, you punk!

378
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
CONDOLENCES

379
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,688
Drink this.

380
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,816
ONE YEAR LATER

381
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,168
Jeong-u.

382
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,419
Dad is dead.

383
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,092
-I know.
-They say I'm going to an orphanage.

384
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,678
No, you aren't.

385
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,180
I won't let you.

386
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,139
Really?

387
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,687
Sneak out with things you need

388
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,814
the night after tomorrow, okay?

389
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,526
Hide at the station.
I'll come and get you.

390
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,028
Until I come,

391
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,073
never get caught by anyone. Okay?

392
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,200
Don't worry.

393
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,827
It's the night after tomorrow.

394
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,120
June 29th.

395
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
Don't forget.

396
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,415
You shouldn't either.

397
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,003
-I won't. It's your birthday.
-Right.

398
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,963
It's my birthday!

399
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,299
I'll make your every wish
come true this year.

400
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,884
Really?

401
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,218
I promised you, remember?

402
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:35,768
SUIN STATION

403
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,745
He will come.

404
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,541
He promised to come.

405
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,961
My brother

406
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
never lies.

407
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,432
Jeong-u!

408
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,101
Where are you?

409
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,729
What's taking you so long?

410
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,316
What's all this?

411
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,402
-What are you doing?
-Oh!

412
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,238
Why did you follow me?

413
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,490
Why on earth are you here?

414
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,743
I came here every year with Dad.

415
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,495
Dad

416
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,581
made wishes like this.

417
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,543
And I'm making wishes on his behalf.

418
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,213
Wishes?

419
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,424
For what?

420
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,509
He made wishes for someone he loved

421
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,262
to be healthy and happy.

422
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,556
Unbelievable.

423
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,893
What the fuck?

424
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,520
Screwing me even now?

425
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,399
I don't care for this shit!

426
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,609
He forgot something more important.

427
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,238
But now I should thank him
for remembering this shit?

428
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,575
Don't put on a fucking show now!

429
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,121
Damn it.

430
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,875
Uncle.

431
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,683
Jeong-u.

432
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,395
Where are you?

433
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:26,981
Where?

434
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,108
Where are you?

435
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,038
SAFETY FIRST, DO NOT ENTER

436
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,634
Why couldn't you make it?

437
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,594
Why didn't you come?

438
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,846
I waited and waited.

439
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,182
I was really scared.

440
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,559
Why?

441
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,644
Why?

442
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,525
Dad said he felt guilty toward someone
because he couldn't keep his promise.

443
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,695
I waited for him three days.

444
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:19,826
A ten-year-old orphan waited three days
because he trusted his brother.

445
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,161
But he didn't come.

446
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,041
My brother who I admired the most…

447
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,670
abandoned me.

448
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,340
When were you supposed to meet?

449
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,636
In 1995.

450
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,971
In 1995.

451
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,305
June 29th!

452
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,060
Dad had a big scar on his back.

453
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,814
He got it from a big accident he was in.

454
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,274
An accident?

455
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,568
So that means

456
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,445
because he was involved in a big accident,

457
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,614
he couldn't make it?

458
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,325
Is it supposed to be his excuse?

459
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,286
Gosh, that's so freaking lame.

460
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,583
June 29th, 1995.

461
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,128
Sampoong Department Store
in Seocho-dong, Seoul

462
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,505
suddenly collapsed
due to structural failure,

463
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,216
which resulted in over 1,000 casualties.

464
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,010
They were employee or guests.

465
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,474
The fifth floor showed signs of collapse
in the morning of the disaster,

466
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,353
but they decided to stay open
while fixing the problems.

467
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,565
At 5:52 p.m.,

468
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,110
the entire building collapsed
in 20 seconds, making a pillar of dust.

469
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,822
The damage estimates were 270 billion won.

470
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,074
A total of casualties included 501 deaths,

471
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,453
six disappearances, and 937 injured.

472
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,165
It was the biggest casualties
since the Korean War.

473
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,139
A video tape containing footage
of the scene seven minutes

474
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,184
after Sampoong Department Store collapsed

475
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,602
has been disclosed.

476
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,437
Screams of those trying to escape

477
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,273
and cries for help
filled the entire footage.

478
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,108
Yoon Yeong-cheol has the story.

479
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,154
Imported luxury goods
were displayed here until yesterday,

480
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,115
but the entire building is now gone
as if it was bombed.

481
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,452
-Only debris…
-It's not a thatched hut.

482
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,996
-How could it collapse like that?
-Good grief.

483
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,832
I heard hundreds of people
are buried under the debris.

484
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,605
Dad said he was rescued
after being trapped for three days.

485
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,152
He was hospitalized for long
because he was badly hurt.

486
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,030
He met my mom in the same hospital.

487
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,369
Mom was always weak,
so she hated being in the hospital.

488
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,666
She said meeting Dad
was the only good thing happened there.

489
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,505
See? He was freaking lucky.

490
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,342
He was badly hurt. How was he lucky?

491
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,595
Because he didn't die

492
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,307
and met a girl like your mom,

493
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,726
he could turn his life around.

494
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,854
What does "turn his life around" mean?

495
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,984
It means his life has changed.

496
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,610
That's right.

497
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,905
Dad said his life changed
because of the disaster.

498
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,369
He said he decided
to be a firefighter since then.

499
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,519
4, HANEULSAN-RO 29-GIL

500
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,403
Hey.

501
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,905
Where are you going?

502
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,950
To put it in the cabinet in the storage.

503
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,536
The cabinet? What for?

504
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,704
There's no reason.

505
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
After this trip, we always put this there.

506
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,583
That's what Dad did.

507
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,146
Shit.

508
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,768
LOOKING FOR MY MISSING BROTHER
NAME: CHO SANG-GU

509
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,524
AGE: 10, BORN IN 1986
LAST SEE ON JUNE 30TH, 1995

510
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,403
So, what kind of gift
would you like to have?

511
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,114
Nike.

512
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,616
-Nike?
-Yes.

513
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,825
You mean the sneakers?

514
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,953
I want the real ones, not the fake ones.

515
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,122
They have to be
from a big department store in Seoul.

516
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,500
Okay, I'll get you those.

517
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:25,960
Really?

518
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,143
Here you are.

519
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,781
I'll make

520
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,200
your every wish come true this year.

521
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:07,376
SAMPOONG DEPARTMENT STORE

522
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:45,998
Sang-gu.

523
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,333
Sang-gu.

524
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:48,917
Sang-gu.

525
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,894
SANG-GU, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!

526
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:11,398

FROM YOUR BROTHER, WHO LOVES YOU

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,322

528
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,241
Sang-gu! It's me, your brother!

529
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,285
Sang-gu!

530
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,980
He passed away. I mean Mr. Han.

531
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:06,286
HAPPY 14TH BIRTHDAY, SANG-GU

534
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,852

"Adoption"?

537
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,277
Then Geu-ru was

538
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,905
adopted?
