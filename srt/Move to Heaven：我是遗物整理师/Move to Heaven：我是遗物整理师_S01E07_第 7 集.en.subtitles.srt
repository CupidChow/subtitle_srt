1
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,205
-What happened?
-He's failing rapidly.

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,874
Has it happened before?

3
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,044
It's happened sometimes
since his organic functions are weak.

4
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,922
However, they say
it doesn't look good this time.

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,218
"It doesn't look good"?
What does that mean?

6
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,846
He might have to undergo surgery.

7
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,849
If he needs it, he should.
What are you waiting for?

8
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,808
Sang-gu.

9
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,812
Are you worried about the money?
I'll take care of it, so--

10
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,694
We haven't been able to stabilize him.

11
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,655
We wouldn't recommend the surgery
in his condition…

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,950
What's going to happen to him
if he doesn't get it?

13
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,621
Prepare yourselves to let him to go.

14
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,500
Fuck, no!

15
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,884
Let's get him that surgery.

16
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,470
-Sang-gu!
-Please.

17
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,389
You said he'd die if he doesn't get it.

18
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,683
We can't let him die without trying.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,103
It's your call whether to proceed.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,563
We'll only do what you wish us to do.

21
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,943
You need to discuss it yourselves,
and let us know.

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,535
We should stop here.

23
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,162
No way.

24
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,208
How much longer must Su-cheol and I suffer
just to make you feel at peace?

25
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,670
You've also seen what's going on here.

26
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,548
This is literally living in hell!

27
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,633
He's still alive.

28
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,052
He's held out for this long.

29
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,013
He still breathes, and his heart beats!

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,100
He won't die.

31
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,269
I won't let him.

32
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,147
Sang-gu!

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,735
I'm going to get the money
for his surgery.

34
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,241
Sang-gu!

35
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,582
Damn it.

36
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,261
No.

37
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,313

00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,149

00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,609
REGISTRATION INFORMATION

40
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,162
THE LATE HAN JEONG-U

41
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,664
Now we're even, okay?

42
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,346
Why is he storming out at this hour?

43
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,353
As if he stole something
and ran away with it.

44
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,028
Where's your uncle?

45
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,030
He's out.

46
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,289
Geu-ru.

47
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,417
What do you think of your uncle?

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,753
He is

49
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,256
a filthy person.

50
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,635
He hates taking a shower
and cleaning the house.

51
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,471
He hates doing the laundry and dishes too.

52
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:11,102
He picks his nose and ears
and then wipes his finger on his shirt.

53
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,354
And he wears that same shirt for a week.

54
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,065
-Gross.
-And he is

55
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
a loud person.

56
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:19,861
Sorry?

57
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,240
He speaks loudly and yells a lot.
He also snores terribly when he sleeps.

58
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,452
He makes a lot of noise when he eats.

59
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,955
He burps after a meal.
I can hear him fart even in my room.

60
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,707
Okay, besides those nasty habits,

61
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,169
do you think he's good or evil?

62
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,796
Or do you find him unpleasant or scary?

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,797
Okay.

64
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,551
In that case, he is

65
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,721
a good person in a perplexing way.

66
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,849
What?

67
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,602
He always says bad things.

68
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
Like, "Blockhead! Nutjob."

69
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,901
"Don't make trouble.
Don't do anything stupid."

70
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,404
He's always snappy at me.

71
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,782
Right, but how does it
make him a good person?

72
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,533
But

73
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,204
he always helps me to do
what I want to do.

74
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,124
He found the yellow box in the dumpsite.

75
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,252
He also found the camera
in Ms. Lee's place.

76
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,464
Dad says what makes a good person is

77
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,593
how they try to understand others,
not how they talk.

78
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,262
Therefore,

79
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,681
Uncle is a good person
in a perplexing way.

80
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,663
10 YEARS AGO

81
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,505
Shit.

82
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,589
Bring it on!

83
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,007
You motherfucker!

84
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,355
Nightmare!

85
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
No need to count how much, right?

86
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,715
Hey.

87
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,216
Shit.

88
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,385
Freaking loser.

89
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,762
Wait, let me do it.

90
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,184
Gosh.

91
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,895
-Whoa.
-Get back here.

92
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,273
-Okay, brace yourself.
-Okay, ready?

93
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,483
Here we go.

94
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,485
Geez, man.

95
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,986
Get up, you punk.

96
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,071
Whoa, hey.

97
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,491
Get off me.

98
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
Shit.

99
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,207
You should've listened to me.

100
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,416
Where are you going?

101
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
What are you doing?

102
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,713
-What the fuck?
-Fucking moron.

103
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,758
Stay away, or I'll jump.

104
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,843
Why don't you, sissy?

105
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,804
If you jump,
I'll show your fucking ass respect.

106
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,600
-Jump.
-Little fucker.

107
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
What a moron.

108
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,356
He crossed it over.

109
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,568
-Hey, what are you doing to do?
-Go ahead.

110
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,656
What are you doing?

111
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,409
What?

112
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,954
Who are you?

113
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,666
It's not fucking your business.
Do you know us?

114
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,167
Of course, I don't.

115
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,795
Let's get to know each other.

116
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,756
What are you going to do?
Calling the cops on us?

117
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,635
Promise me
you don't touch that boy anymore,

118
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,053
then I'll walk away.

119
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,889
-Are you doped or something?
-What a nutjob.

120
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,974
Know your place.

121
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,520
What the…

122
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,063
You motherfucker.

123
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,190
Damn it!

124
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,026
Damn it.

125
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,319
-Shit.
-Hey.

126
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,489
Fuck.

127
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,660
If I twist it further,
you'll lose your arm.

128
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,746
I don't mind going to jail
for a few months for this,

129
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,666
but are you okay
with being crippled for life?

130
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,418
Please don't hurt me anymore.

131
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,586
Please.

132
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,755
You'll learn your lesson
once you lose one of your limbs.

133
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,090
-Stay still.
-Don't.

134
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,051
Did you just stop me?

135
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,637
These punks beat the hell out of you,

136
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,180
but you want me to stop?

137
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,932
They won't do that. If they do…

138
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,394
you can give them a lesson again.

139
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,647
Damn it.

140
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,277
Fuck!

141
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,487
Get lost, you punk.

142
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,365
-Let's go.
-Shit.

143
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,913
Thank you.

144
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,795
Don't get the wrong idea.

145
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,548
I don't like those bullies,

146
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,426
but I hate the ones even more
who get beaten up.

147
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,519
BOXING

148
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,011
Hey.

149
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,931
Take this.

150
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,271
I told you to stay away from me.

151
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,732
Please go.

152
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,943
You're really irritating!

153
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,903
Gosh!

154
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,781
Why did I help him the other night?

155
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,699
Geez.

156
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,576
It's on you.

157
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,374
I didn't ask for your help,
but you saved me anyway.

158
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,502
What the heck?

159
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,964
You got to be responsible
since you saved me the other night.

160
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,843
I was as good as dead,
but you brought me back to life.

161
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,762
So be responsible.

162
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,015
Why should I?

163
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,058
Are you crazy?

164
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,476
Get lost.

165
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,854
Go away!

166
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,772
Beat it, you punk!

167
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,779
Get out of my sight!

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,032
What a nutjob! Man.

169
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,428
Man, this little punk again.

170
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,929
Go away.

171
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,806
Get lost.

172
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
Shit, just go now!

173
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,775
Go away!

174
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,289
-Put them on.
-For real?

175
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,082
I'm not sure if they will fit.

176
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,170
It's perfect.

177
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,798
-See?
-With your long arms,

178
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,633
you can be an out-boxer.

179
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,884
"An out-boxer"?

180
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,261
You keep your opponent at a distance,

181
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,971
then finish him with one blow.

182
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,389
"With one blow."

183
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,063
Like this?

184
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,859
An out-boxer has a long reach,
but he must be freaking fast.

185
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,444
Like this.

186
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,488
-Give it a go.
-Wow.

187
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,076
Darn.

188
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,161
Put your guard up.

189
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,499
Extend your arm fast.

190
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,501
Wrap it around.

191
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,003
-And do that twice.
-Okay.

192
00:13:58,712 --> 00:13:59,755
When you are done,

193
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,967
put it between your fingers.

194
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,468
Okay.

195
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,180
Go between the index finger and the thumb,

196
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,391
and wrap it around your wrist.

197
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,357
No. Bend your knees, you stupid.

198
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,569
Keep your guard up, okay? Again.

199
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,947
One, two. Step forward a bit more.

200
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,073
One, two!

201
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,912
Stretch your arm.

202
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,665
Use your hip. Keep your guard up.

203
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,250
Keep your hands up. Again.

204
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,503
Good! Keep it up! Don't give up!

205
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,713
One, two! Nice!

206
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,926
Don't touch the rope.

207
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,469
Use your knees more!

208
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,682
There you go! One, two!

209
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,766
Good job!

210
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,685
Make a last spurt!

211
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,812
We're not done yet. Go faster!

212
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,772
Let's Go!

213
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,984
Good! Till the end! Don't give up yet!

214
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,865
Su-jin, what are you doing here?

215
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,576
This is my sister.

216
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,286
Okay. Hi.

217
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,747
-This is my coach.
-Oh, I see.

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,595
Nice! Wonderful!

219
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,807
Here comes a punch. Good.

220
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,934
You dodge.

221
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,810
Hook! That's it!

222
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,611
You can't end up like me.

223
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,907
Let's go to a sport university
and to the national championships!

224
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,995
And why not be a national athlete too?

225
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,336
-Keep your distance.
-Round three.

226
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,129
-Good.
-Kim Su-cheol is

227
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,590
-the red, and the blue is…
-What's he doing?

228
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,175
-Man.
-Kim isn't doing good.

229
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,552
Su-cheol, don't get worked up. Stay calm.

230
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,179
-Okay, right hook!
-That's it.

231
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,806
-He gave a blow.
-Get in there.

232
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,557
-He keeps pushing.
-Good! Go!

233
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,642
-Right punch!
-Nice!

234
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,310
-One down.
-There you go!

235
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,938
Good! He's got one down!

236
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,982
-His strategy was good.
-That's right.

237
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,984
-Let's go.
-Kim is at an advantage.

238
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,527
We've worked hard for this.

239
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,821
-Using this chance, he should
-That's right.

240
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,030
-push him hard.
-Good.

241
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,116
-Time is almost up.
-Throw a counter now.

242
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,618
That's right! Beautiful!

243
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,872
-Kim got it!
-His right hook on the jaw was beautiful.

244
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,041
-Don't get up.
-The match is over.

245
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,670
Kim has won by a knockout.

246
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,006
-At the 94th national championships,
-He won!

247
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,675
Kim has made it to the top.

248
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,385
Kim Su-cheol is a winner!

249
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,887
You are the champion! Goodness!

250
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,223
He has been training hard…

251
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,061
That's right!

252
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,647
I trained that punk, you know?

253
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,859
Respect, Kim Su-cheol!

254
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
I need money.

255
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,133
REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE

256
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,802
Take it as collateral
and lend me money for surgery.

257
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,970
I need it now.

258
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,930
For surgery?

259
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,769
You mean you need money for Su-cheol?

260
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,399
You're something, you know that?

261
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,071
If his condition got worse to that point,
you should just thank him.

262
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,948
He's giving you a way out.

263
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,367
I don't need a way out.

264
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,790
There's a big match in a month.
Moneybags from overseas will come.

265
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,208
I won't fight anymore.

266
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,753
-You saw me on the ring.
-That's why I organized the event.

267
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,756
Everyone thinks
you're a washed-up fighter.

268
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,013
Did you forget already
what you did to me and Su-cheol?

269
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,558
I won't be played
by your little scheme again.

270
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,773
It's up to you.

271
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:32,152
You can get the money for the surgery
and for all your debts with this one game.

272
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,196
If you do well,

273
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,448
I'll give back this deed,

274
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,159
untouched.

275
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,297
HOSPITAL NOW! SU-JIN

276
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,221
You…

277
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,037
Su-jin!

278
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,040
Sang-gu.

279
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,793
I got the money.
Let's get him the surgery.

280
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,091
What are you doing? We need to hurry.

281
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,426
Get him the surgery now!

282
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,431
He's just…

283
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
gone.

284
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,166
No, he can't be.

285
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,793
No.

286
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,216
No!

287
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,148
Get up, you punk.

288
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,401
You can't die.

289
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,279
You're not allowed to die!

290
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,781
Sang-gu!

291
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,408
You said I own your life.

292
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,286
So please get up now.

293
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,873
Get up now, and keep your promise!

294
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,167
Get up.

295
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,669
-Su-cheol!
-Get up…

296
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,754
Su-cheol!

297
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,339
Su-cheol…

298
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,217
Su-cheol…

299
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,595
Su-cheol!

300
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,931
Come in. It's a bit messy, though.

301
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,938
Have a seat there. I'll go make some tea.

302
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,363
Thank you.

303
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,699
For what?

304
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,036
For never giving up on my brother.

305
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,831
What are you talking about?

306
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,626
If you hadn't insisted on
keeping him alive,

307
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,545
I would have given up long ago.

308
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,383
One day,

309
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,843
I had this thought.

310
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,597
Like, on the day of the accident,

311
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,520
it'd have been better if he just had died.

312
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,985
Su-jin.

313
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,906
I hated myself
for having that kind of thought,

314
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,494
and I hated Su-cheol
for making me think like that.

315
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,289
I was sorry for him

316
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,917
but I hated him too.

317
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,339
You should've blamed me.

318
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,509
It was all my fault.

319
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,929
But I realized today

320
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,017
that I'm glad
to stay by him even that way.

321
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,982
If I had given up on him early,

322
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,777
I wouldn't have forgiven myself.

323
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,409
I wonder why now, though.

324
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,130
Maybe he was

325
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,883
waiting for you.

326
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,151
Su-jin.

327
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,739
Do you mind

328
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,368
if I take care of Su-cheol's belongings?

My boy, I'm so proud of you!

332
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,132
It's perfect.

333
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,092

PATIENT: KIM SU-CHEOL
CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY

338
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,244
What?

339
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,539
Sang-gu.

340
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,252
I decided to quit boxing.

341
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,596
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

342
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,099
Are you serious?

343
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,394
Yes. I'm thinking
to run a supply store with my dad.

344
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,063
Kim Su-cheol, manager of Cheoljin Supply.

345
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,732
That'll be on my business card.

346
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,197
I want to make my dad's dream come true
before it's too late.

347
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,202
I'll fill you in on the details later.

Anyway,

351
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,094
you got a different opponent for tonight.

352
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,390
Suddenly?
You didn't say anything about it.

353
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,268
It's a big match. We need someone special.

354
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,980
So, who is he?

355
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,733
Does it matter?

356
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,609
Remember.

357
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,319
It's round seven.

358
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,823
You can finish it
neither before nor after.

359
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,367
A knock out at round seven.

360
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,579
Just do your thing as usual.

361
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,503
Today,

362
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,091
we have a new face for this special match.

363
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,512
A former national athlete,
a former WBO Junior Lightweight Champion.

364
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,224
Kim Su-cheol!

365
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:43,698
Shit.

366
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,663
Shit.

367
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,297
Kim Su-cheol!

368
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,927
What's going on? What are you doing here?

369
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,930
-I didn't know I'd be fighting you.
-Why are you here?

370
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,182
To make money for my new business.

371
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,225
Oh gosh.

372
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,937
-What are you doing?
-Fight!

373
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,565
Hey, will you fight already?

374
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,776
Shit.

375
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,280
Okay, throw a punch, then.

376
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,740
No way. I won't.

377
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,617
Just do it, you idiot.

378
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,327
No way. You do it first.

379
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,037
Hey, Kim Su-cheol.

380
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,707
Are you still that fucking stupid wimp?

381
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,628
Are you back to that loser
who got beaten up on that bridge?

382
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,672
-Don't.
-So what are you going to do?

383
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,759
A national athlete? A champion?
I can fucking eat you alive.

384
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,469
-Sang-gu!
-Hit me.

385
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,512
Give it a go.

386
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,680
Come on. Do it.

387
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,598
Hit me now!

388
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,231
Come on. Do it now.

389
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,079
You fucking wuss, is this all you got?

390
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,129
Come on in.

391
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,385
Good.

392
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,453
Nice!

393
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,003
Go!

394
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:02,921
Good!

395
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,714
Smash him!

396
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,091
Get him!

397
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,134
Fight back!

398
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,223
Get in there now!

399
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,934
What are you waiting for?

400
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,070
Sweetie.

401
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,238
I get why you're doing this,

402
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,035
but we'll all go down
unless you stick to the plan.

403
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,412
Especially him.

404
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,958
That champion kid you care about so much.

405
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,295
It's his chance
to make money for his retirement,

406
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,298
but he won't get a penny
if you screw this over.

407
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,177
If that happens, who should be blamed?

408
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,390
Me? Or you?

409
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,724
Tell me the truth.

410
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,269
You brought Su-cheol here
on purpose, didn't you?

411
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,771
Tell me.

412
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,815
Answer me, you bitch.

413
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,276
It doesn't matter now.

414
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,737
Think carefully.

415
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,322
What do you think

416
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,993
is the best present
you can give to that kid?

417
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,127
Oh no. It's round seven already.

418
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,446
I'll fight in the last game before I quit.

419
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,241
I'm thinking
to run a supply store with my dad.

420
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,411
Kim Su-cheol, manager of Cheoljin Supply.

421
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,705
That'll be on my business card.

422
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,978
Shit.

423
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,483
Don't get up.

424
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
Don't you get up!

425
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,449
Please don't get up.

426
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,159
Just do what I say!

427
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,920
Oh yeah!

428
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,803
Sang-gu!

429
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,388
Sang-gu!

430
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:01,891
Over here!

431
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,310
Sang-gu! It's me, your brother!

432
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,604
Sang-gu!

433
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,691
Jeong-u, don't go.

434
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,944
Please take me with you.

435
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,571
Sang-gu, I'll be back for you shortly.

436
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,825
Okay? I'll be back soon, Sang-gu.
Just wait a bit.

437
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,827
-Punk, beat it!
-Sang-gu!

438
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,744
Jeong-u!

439
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,830
Please take me with you.

440
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,459
Fucking brother, my ass.

441
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,131
I have no brother now!
Don't you dare call yourself that!

442
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,223
Su-cheol.

443
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,905
Su-cheol.

444
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,408
Su-cheol!

445
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,669
Su-cheol…

446
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,847
No…

447
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,860
HAN JEONG-U, TRAUMA CLEANER

448
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,199
SANG-GU'S OLDER BROTHER!
MAKE SURE THEY MEET!

449
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:13,948
