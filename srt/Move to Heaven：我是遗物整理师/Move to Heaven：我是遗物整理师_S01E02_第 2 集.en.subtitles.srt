00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:34,743
Mr. Cho Sang-gu.

LAWYER OH HYUN-CHANG

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,962
A lawyer?

5
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
I came to see you
on behalf of Mr. Han Jeong-u.

6
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,967
Shit.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,303
I have a message for you.

8
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,056
Tell him I want nothing to hear from him.

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,770
He passed away.

10
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,022
I mean Mr. Han.

11
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,450
Fuck!

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,120
I knew it'd be great

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,539
to be out again.

14

LAWYER OH HYUN-CHANG

15
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,468
After Mr. Han learned
that his health is failing,

16
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,471
he had his legal affairs in order
for his remaining family.

17
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,850
His son, Han Geu-ru, is
the only family he has left.

18
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,521
I don't give a damn.
What did he say about me in his will?

19
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,732
He stated in his will
that in the event of his death,

20
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:52,112
he would like you to be Geu-ru's guardian.

21
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,905
"Guardian"?

22
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,407
What's that?

23
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,744
A guardian is a person
who is designated

24
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,831
to look after and protect a ward
who is incapacitated

25
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,250
with an illness, disability, or old age.

26
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,669
What are you talking about?
How old is the kid?

27
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,962
He just turned 20.

28
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,132
So he's not a kid.
Why would he need protection?

29
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,301
Geu-ru is a bit challenged.

30
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,554
Challenged?

31
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,347
I get it.

32
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,224
So, he wanted me

33
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,518
to babysit his handicapped son?

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,644
LAST WILL

35
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,979
No, thank you.

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,358
I thought he left me something nice
out of petty guilt.

37
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,236
Instead, he's screwing me
even from the grave.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,157
Mr. Cho Sang-gu.

39
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,867
Mr. Cho!

40
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,314
You must've worked out much in prison.

41
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,401
As you know,
it's freaking boring in there.

42
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,778
When will you start again?

43
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,698
I've never said I would.

44
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,534
How will a fighting dog
make a living without fighting?

45
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,537
I'll start looking for something.

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,831
I know you can't afford that luxury.

47
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,335
Bye.

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,464
By the way,

49
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,218
do you know anything about guardianship?

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,513
-Why do you ask?
-Someone asked me to be one.

51
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,766
Who?

52
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,062
What kind of wacko asked you
to be something like that?

53
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,607
There's this nutjob I know.

54
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,569
Does this ward have some money?

55
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,489
What if he does?
Can I get something out of it?

56
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,616
If he has some assets,

57
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,411
the guardian can have
free access to them. Isn't it cool?

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
Free access?

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,167
Someone I know
became a guardian of an old man

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,044
and made some fortune out of it.

61
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,047
So I know a bit about it.

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
Excuse me!

63
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,312
About that thing. What should I do?

64
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,400
I mean the guardian thing. I'll do it.

65
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,486
-Really?
-Yes.

66
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,406
So just tell me what to do.

67
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,209
You have to meet a few conditions
to be Geu-ru's guardian.

68
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,881
First, from now
you must move into Geu-ru's house

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,134
and amicably live with him
for three months.

70
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,011
Second,

71
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,262
for those three months,

72
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,514
you must work for Move to Heaven

73
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,976
which is a trauma cleaning service
Mr. Han and Geu-ru have run.

74
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,813
Han Jeong-u must've left
a quite fortune

75
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,107
to have you work for him.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,776
I can't say
if he left a huge fortune or not,

77
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,865
but it's enough for Geu-ru
to live properly for the rest of his life.

78
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,494
Wow, good for him.

79
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,289
How could he make such money?

80
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,958
To be exact, it's not Mr. Han's.

81
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,210
It's the inheritance
left by his late wife.

82
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,672
Now, Geu-ru has become a sole heir to it.

83
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,680
Who is it?

84
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,101
Hi, Mr. Oh.

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,896
You are here too.
Is everything okay with Geu-ru?

86
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,149
No. This weird man just barged in.

87
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,277
He's already here?
You must be quite surprised.

88
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,278
What?

89
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,655
Do you know him?

90
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,824
Let's go inside. I'll explain everything.

91
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,789
Geu-ru, say hello to

92
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,499
Mr. Cho Sang-gu.

93
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,501
He's your uncle.

94
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,211
His uncle?

95
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,507
She is Geu-ru's friend from next door.

96
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,135
Hello, I am--

97
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,847
I'm your uncle.

98
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,319
Whatever.

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,030
Your dad had a younger brother.

101
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,367
So, he asked your uncle to look after you

102
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,495
in case he might not be around.

103
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,332
You remember the guardianship contract
we discussed with your dad?

104
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,379
Mr. Cho Sang-gu there is
the guardian your dad told you about.

105
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,798
Are you okay with this?

106
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,551
-If you're not up for it--
-That's fine.

107
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,970
I promised with Dad.

108
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,640
Really? Then from now on,

109
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,476
-I hope you get along with your uncle.
-Hang on.

110
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,564
Why do so-called brothers have
different last names?

111
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,233
-Because our seeds are different.
-Sorry?

112
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,735
We have different fathers.

113
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,657
Han Jeong-u's mom married my old man
and gave birth to me.

114
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,786
Oh, Mr. Cho is a new employee
at Move to Heaven as well.

115
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,874
So you need to train him well
as a senior staff, okay?

116
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,042
-Gosh.
-A new employee?

117
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,128
This guy?

118
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,383
Mr. Oh, you can't leave them like this.

119
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,596
Sudden changes of the surroundings
will be too much for Geu-ru.

120
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,891
It could be a sudden change,
but we have no choice.

121
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,146
Also, we can't deny the fact
that Mr. Cho is Geu-ru's only relative.

122
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,483
-Still, it's too much for him.
-Na-mu.

123
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,861
Can you keep an eye on them
to see if they get along?

124
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,571
And call me if anything happens.

125
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,156
Thanks for your help.

126
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,159
What?

127
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,369
Darn it.

128
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,166
So, you're Geu-ru, right?

129
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,502
I am Han Geu-ru.

130
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,171
Did your dad give you
such a ridiculous name?

131
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:31,260
Yes, and it means a tree. He wanted me
to contribute to the world as a tree does

132
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,139
because it gives us
oxygen, fruits, firewood,

133
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,266
and a stump we can sit on and rest.

134
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,894
It's the second-best living thing
in the world.

135
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,106
-"Second"?
-The best living thing in the world is

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,400
Han Jeong-u's son, Han Geu-ru.
Dad said that.

137
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,917
-No, you can't.
-Why not?

138
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,585
You can't!

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,088
I can't even have water?
You'd better let go.

140
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,173
No, it's my dad's cup.

141
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,925
Only he can use it.

142
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,597
What a moron.

143
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,107
What's wrong with your tone?
You sound like a robot.

144
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,859
Shoot, I believe there's a term for this.

145
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,239
You mean AI?

146
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,033
That's right.
Don't people say you sound just like it?

147
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,077
I have Asperger's syndrome.

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,206
I have difficulty interpreting
people's emotions and social interactions.

149
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,291
I can already see

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,169
that you have
freaking loads of difficulties.

151
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,509
Anyway, let's try to make this work.

152
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,311
I can use this room, right?

153
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,649
No. It's my dad's.

154
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,985
Only he can use this room.

155
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,699
Your dad is not here. He's dead.

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,370
The dead don't need a room,
so let me use it.

157
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,707
-No, you can't.
-Gosh, this punk is a real blockhead.

158
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
What can you do? Stop me?

159
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,922
Hey, Han Geu-ru or Han guru, listen now.

160
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,883
I didn't come here because I wanted.

161
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,302
So, let's try to be patient

162
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,596
and stay out of each other's way.

163
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,599
Let's hold out for three months.
All right, Nephew?

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,143
-Move aside.
-I can't.

165
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,519
-Ouf of the way.
-I can't.

166
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,146
I can't! No!

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,692
Bottom stake, Rajidae, Rajiformes,
Chondrichthyes, Chordata, Animalia.

168
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,235
-Hey!
-Its snout cartilage is

169
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,655
-soft and flexible.
-What has gotten into you?

170
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,614
Don't--

171
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,033
Its head and pectoral fin form an arc
and anterior margin is…

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,993
-…also round.
-Next door.

173
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,704
-What's with this punk?
-What did you do to him?

174
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,165
Me? I didn't do anything.

175
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,917
Dad's room is only for Dad.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
You can't go into his room.

177
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,879
Were you going to use this room?

178
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
I was. So what?

179
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,799
I can't believe it.

180
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,553
Geu-ru can't take changes
in his familiar surroundings or rules.

181
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,058
So, if you want to stay here,
you must do things his way.

182
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,768
I can't believe this.

183
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,312
Geu-ru, calm down.

184
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,441
Your uncle won't use this room.
So please calm down, all right?

185
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,778
You won't, right?

186
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,697
Where am I supposed to stay?

187
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,621
Geu-ru, do you want me
to show you how to fry an egg?

188
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,461
Wouldn't it be nice if you can do it
when I'm not around?

189
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,173
Why wouldn't you be around?

190
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,175
Are you going somewhere?

191
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,177
No.

192
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,724
It's because I also want
to have an egg you fry at times.

193
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,988
ARE YOU OKAY, GEU-RU?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH YOU?

194
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,372
SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN,
CALL ME RIGHT AWAY, OKAY?

195
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,333
Gosh.

196
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,712
Why doesn't he check the messages?
I'm worried sick here.

197
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,049
So you married a rich girl who died young

198
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,261
and turned your life around 180 degrees?

199
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,912
Han Jeong-u.

200
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:18,292
I don't understand
why you have brought me here,

201
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,253
but don't worry too much.

202
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,214
I'll take special care of

203
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,509
your little precious son.

204
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,243
Oh man.

205
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,337
It is still hurt.

206
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,339
It is still hurt.

207
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,550
It is still hurt.

208
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,136
-Who's there?
-It'll die.

209
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,183
-It'll die if it is in pain.
-How did you get in at this hour?

210
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,769
-You should leave!
-It can't die.

211
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,605
-Stop it.
-If it is in pain, it'll die.

212
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,691
-It shouldn't die.
-Cut it out.

213
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,610
I don't want it to die. It shouldn't die.

214
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,320
-Stop!
-It can't be in pain.

215
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,115
-I don't want it to die.
-You got to stop.

216
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,658
-Please.
-Don't die.

217
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,286
-Stop.
-It shouldn't die. I don't want it to die.

218
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,581
Let me see.

219
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,501
Are you okay?

220
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,963
You should've come here with me.

221
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,550
You only come here when it's closed.
Next closed day is long away.

222
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,971
You must've been worried a lot
about Yellow.

223
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,100
Yellow is in lots of pain.
If it doesn't get treated, it'll die.

224
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,021
It's getting treated,
but it takes time to heal.

225
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,067
Knowing about the condition
and getting treated are important.

226
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,234
Or else, you'll die.

227
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,071
I didn't know my dad was ill.

228
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,574
He died because he wasn't treated in time.

229
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,244
Yellow will die like my dad
unless it gets treated soon.

230
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:06,001
Yes, you might die
if an illness is unnoticed and untreated.

231
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,005
But Geu-ru, you noticed and told us
Yellow was hurt when it couldn't itself.

232
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,050
Therefore, Yellow will never die.

233
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,676
That's a lie.

234
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,554
It will die eventually
as it's a living thing.

235
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,266
It's a lie when you say
a living thing will never die.

236
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,184
You're right. 

237
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,271
But we won't let it die
from the wound there.

238
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,274
Can you promise?

239
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,776
I promise.

240
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,697
If you break your promise,
you'll get your tongue pulled out in hell.

241
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,742
I saw it in Along with the gods.

242
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,345
Oh my!

243
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,098
What's all this?

244
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,642
Excuse me.

245
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,227
Uncle Sang-gu.

246
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,521
-Mister!
-Shit.

247
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,773
Gosh, darn it.

248
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,944
What's all this racket in this early hour?

249
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,739
Is this some kind of performance art?

250
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,327
How could you turn the house
into a huge mess in less than a day?

251
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,204
Didn't I tell you?

252
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,667
Geu-ru can't take any changes
in his familiar rules and surroundings.

253
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,338
Then we can change those darn rules
to make everyone happy.

254
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,675
"When you are in Rome, do as Romans do."

255
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,428
What are you saying? I'm not a Roman.

256
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,222
But I know one thing.

257
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:46,393
This is not your house. It's mine.

258
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,771
So stop yapping at me,

259
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,316
and go back to yours.

260
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,280
All righty,
I need to catch up on my sleep.

261
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,575
Darn it.

262
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,415
Hello?

263
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,044
Mr. Oh, what kind of person
is Geu-ru's uncle?

264
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,546
I can't believe how ludicrous he is.

265
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,466
You can't possibly imagine
what happened today.

266
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,427
If he's supposed to be a guardian,

267
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,054
shouldn't he act like one?

268
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,641
He is more like a bully than a guardian.
A real bully.

269
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,185
You know, a thug. He's a total thug!

270
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,063
He's likely to put Geu-ru in danger,
not to protect him!

271
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,357
Are you done?

272
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,483
Sorry?

273
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,444
Can I talk now?

274
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,331
So what you're saying is

275
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,752
he has to do well with Gu-ru
and Move to Heaven for three months

276
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,963
in order to be an official guardian,
right?

277
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,049
I guess it's like a test.
What if he fails?

278
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:03,887
If there is a disqualifying ground
for them to live together,

279
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,889
Mr. Cho will be dismissed.

280
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,767
Geu-ru's dad gave me the right to decide.

281
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,645
-Then you can now--
-I don't think so.

282
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,066
It'll be hard for both of them
to get used to this arrangement,

283
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,485
especially for Geu-ru for now.

284
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,447
What if something bad happens
during that trial period?

285
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,825
That's where you come in.

286
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,661
You can watch them most closely.

287
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,873
Your report will be
a critical factor in my decision.

288
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,502
Can I trust you to be impartial
when you watch them?

289
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,196
Put your garbage in the bin.

290
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,615
Wash the dishes
when you're done using them.

291
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:10,120
Put dirty socks and clothes in the basket.
Don't touch other people's stuff.

292
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,081
Take out recyclables
on Mondays and Thursdays.

293
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,217
We must be ready to leave.
We got a new job.

294
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,044
Geu-ru, what are you doing?

295
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,006
We got a request.
We should be ready to go to the scene.

296
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,133
Scene? What scene?

297
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,596
But how can you work alone
without your dad?

298
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,308
I can work alone. I'll do things
the way I used to do with him.

299
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,434
Work?

300
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,145
You mean removing a corpse thing?

301
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,107
It's called trauma cleaning.

302
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,734
Can he do it alone?

303
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,031
He's not doing it alone.
Mr. Oh said you must work with him too.

304
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,994
The address is 4, Sanjeong-ro 51-gil.
We must be there by 11 o'clock.

305
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,748
We must keep an appointment with a client.
We'll get going now.

306
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,959
Are you thinking to drive?

307
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,837
Since my dad isn't here, I must do it.

308
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,673
Oh no. You can't.

309
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,343
What if something goes wrong
like the last time?

310
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,138
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-Uncle Sang-gu.

311
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,432
You can drive, right?

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,492
Get out of the way.

313
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,246
Darn it, move!

314
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,332
The light! It's red!

315
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,959
Don't.

316
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,867
This is it, right?

317
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,580
You violated speed limit 9 times,
lane change 35 times,

318
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,082
stop line 8 times, traffic light 7 times.

319
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,752
Breaking traffic laws is
a criminal offense.

320
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,588
You broke the law
59 times in total for 40 minutes.

321
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,715
Did you count them all?

322
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,261
Let's get to work.

323
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,924
We're trauma cleaners from Move to Heaven.

324
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,387
Are you Ms. Lee Yeong-sun's family
who requested the service for her?

325
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,348
Yes, we are.
How long will it take to clean?

326
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,183
To be exact, it's trauma cleaning.

327
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,311
Whatever.
Just tell me how long it'll take.

328
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,607
We have to see the scene first.

329
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,610
We couldn't go in
because it felt a bit weird.

330
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,990
The deceased had some fortune
although she lived in a place like this.

331
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,826
It's the second room on the left.

332
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,705
If you find a bankbook or cash,
bring it to us right away.

333
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:25,667
If we find any valuables,
documents, bankbooks, and cash,

334
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,877
we take photos
and give them with the list.

335
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,756
How can we trust you?
You could just say there was none.

336
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,801
We'll be sticking around right here.

337
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,138
Get inside, and bring it out right away.

338
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,098
-Got it?
-What?

339
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,269
Anyway, we'll wait in the car.
Please do a good job.

340
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,105
-Let's go.
-Okay.

341
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,108
-Let's wait in the car.
-Gosh, get off me.

342
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,362
So, they'll be here to watch us
in case we might steal something?

343
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,199
They can't trust us but don't want
to get their hands dirty either?

344
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,535
Bullshit.

345
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,433
So is this the scene?

346
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,747
Are you okay?

347
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,296
The scene is contaminated
as she was found three weeks after death.

348
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,257
Hey, how can you be calm over this?

349
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,427
You were such a neat freak back at home.

350
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:04,057
That's my home,
but the scenes are homes of the deceased.

351
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,852
They request us to clean theirs
because they can't do it.

352
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,729
So, I'm okay with it.

353
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,981
I can make them clean for them.

354
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,694
You should wait here.

355
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,029
I'll do the cleaning.

356
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,033
After I'm done,
you can take things out of here.

357
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,618
Hey.

358
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,960
Did you hear she was found
a month after her death?

359
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,171
Gosh, she had a son and a daughter-in-law,

360
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,592
but they neglected her with dementia
and never checked on her.

361
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,720
What a shame.

362
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,217
Geu-ru.

363
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,850
Don't be nervous.
Just do your work as always.

364
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,644
Just like when I was around.

365
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,565
-Just like when you were around.
-That's right.

366
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,777
What's the first step?

367
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,082
Ms. Lee Yeong-sun,

368
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,628
you passed away on March 31st, 2020.

369
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,758
We're trauma cleaners from Move to Heaven.

370
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,092
Our names are Han Jeong--

371
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,602
My name is Han Geu-ru.

372
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,315
I'll now begin to help you

373
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,567
with your final move, Ms. Lee Yeong-sun.

374
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,028
FREE CHECKING ACCOUNT BANKBOOK

375
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,463
WITHDRAWAL RECEIPT

376
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,346
THE LATE LEE YEONG-SUN, REST IN PEACE

377
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,188
Have you found anything?

378
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,950
Honey, a bankbook!

379
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,078
What? What is this?

380
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,455
Gosh, this hag.

381
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,041
What did she withdraw the money for?

382
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,418
These are all garbage.

383
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,170
Throw them away.

384
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,466
-But they are family photos.
-Which are useless.

385
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,094
Are you sure
you looked thoroughly everywhere?

386
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,680
What about cash? You didn't find any?

387
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,974
Forget it.
I told you we didn't need to come.

388
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,100
I found some.

389
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,061
What did you say?

390
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,021
It's in the room.

391
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,107
I mean cash.

392
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,491
Where? Darn it.

393
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,159
Where is the money?

394
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,712
Oh no.

395
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,422
Oh my goodness!

396
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,759
Look what the hag did.
What was she thinking stashing money here?

397
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,469
She surely was crazy!

398
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,888
I can't believe this.

399
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,271
What are you doing? Go pick them up.

400
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,858
Hurry up. Darn it. 

401
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,618
There's more over there.

402
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,912
Grab everything.

403
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,916
But how are we going to use these?

404
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,337
I don't think a bank will exchange them.
Why don't you try to wash them?

405
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,840
No way I will. You should do it.

406
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,551
-Shall I give them up, then?
-What? It's a lot.

407
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,271
Hey, can you do something about them?

408
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,648
What? What do you think we--

409
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,611
Contaminated bills can be restored
by using chemicals and then drying.

410
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:36,783
Then the Bank of Korea will exchange them
into new ones upon your request.

411
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,203
You mean you can make
these bills usable, right?

412
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,245
Yes.

413
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,664
Good. Take it.

414
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,458
Get me new ones.

415
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,503
I've counted them all,
so don't you dare fool me.

416
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,420
Unbelievable.

417
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,299
Darn.

418
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,303
Finish the job.

419
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,017
Shit!

420
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,937
Darn it!

421
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,112
Where is the family?

422
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,031
How would I know? Probably they went home.

423
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,201
They shouldn't leave yet.
I have something to show.

424
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,872
Didn't you hear them calling it garbage?
They told us to throw it away.

425
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,624
This is not garbage.

426
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,630
What do you keep it for?
Even the family doesn't want it!

427
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,675
Darn this little punk.

428
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,433
Geu-ru.

429
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,895
Oh, you came out for work.

430
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,570
You must be Geu-ru's uncle.

431
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,824
Nice to meet you. I'm Park Ju-taek,
a waste disposal truck driver.

432
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,993
Hello. I'm Cho Sang-gu.

433
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,704
Are you close to the Hans?

434
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,332
He was such a nice man I've met
after defecting to the South.

435
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,628
I was heartbroken
over what happened to Mr. Han.

436
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,840
Please take good care of Geu-ru.

437
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,217
Thank you for being here for him.

438
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,260
Okay.

439
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,391
Anyway, I thought this was just cleaning,
but it seems more than that.

440
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,562
Other companies discard things like waste,
but the Hans work differently.

441
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,772
Differently? How?

442
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,151
Now that you start working with him,
you'll know what I mean.

443
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,945
You're in for good work.
Hope you stay long.

444
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,033
Geu-ru, are you done?

445
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,076
Hey, take it easy.

446
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,161
Gosh.

447
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,079
"Good work"?

448
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,707
Shoot.

449
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,010
-All right. See you around.
-Okay, bye.

450
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,012
COLLECTION, HAUL, DISPOSAL

451
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,143
That little punk.

452
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,825
SPEEDY AND SAFE WASTE DISPOSAL

453
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,454
Ugh.

454
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,709
I've taken a few showers already,
but I still smell like shit.

455
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,295
The main components of foul smells are

456
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,964
ammonia, methanethiol,

457
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,091
hydrogen sulfide, dimethyl sulfide,

458
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,718
trimethylamine, acetaldehyde,

459
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,097
toluene, xylene,
methylethylketone, et cetera.

460
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,684
Ammonia is often associated
with toilet smell

461
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,353
because it's the main component
of human excretion.

462
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,858
Some foods that we eat
reek of ammonia too.

463
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,864
Fermented food like cheese, raw skate,
and stinky tofu smells ammonia over time.

464
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,412
The odor at the scenes is 10 to 40 times
stronger than that of public toilets.

465
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,497
Shit.

466
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:16,669
By the way, it's not always
as bad as this scene, is it?

467
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,131
What was that thing on the floor?
It wasn't solid nor liquid.

468
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,299
Yuk.

469
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,175
It was rotten bodily fluid.

470
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,596
It consists of blood, fat, and dead cells
that leaked out of the body and congealed.

471
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:33,728
Bodily fluid makes up
about 60 % of your weight.

472
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,148
The scene was relatively clean
as the weather wasn't hot.

473
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,651
It was hard the other time
because there were many bugs and maggots.

474
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,195
We can drive bugs out,

475
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,365
but maggots have to be burned
with hydrochloric acid or oil.

476
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,169
Goodness.

477
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,463
Man.

478
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,384
Did everything go okay?

479
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,348
If it got you worried that much,
why don't you start working here?

480
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,433
I'm seriously considering it.

481
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,103
I heard from Uncle Ju-taek it was okay.

482
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,481
Who are you really?

483
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,025
Don't tell a lie
that you're Geu-ru's friend.

484
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,526
It's not a lie.

485
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,031
You expect me to believe
a girl like you is a friend of that moron?

486
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,116
This is unbelievable.

487
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,702
Then what kind of relationship
do you think it is?

488
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,873
You know, maybe you're a part-timer
getting paid much for looking after him

489
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,541
like a babysitter.

490
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,545
There's a saying
for this kind of situation.

491
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,590
"You see things as you are."

492
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,967
I'll be honest while we're at it.

493
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,346
The fact Geu-ru lives with a man
who thinks he's a moron

494
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,932
really, seriously, totally sickens me.

495
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,353
I don't understand why Uncle Jeong-u
brought someone like you here,

496
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,022
but I can't argue with him now,
so I'll let it pass.

497
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,108
Be nice to Geu-ru

498
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,818
because I'll keep my eye on you

499
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,653
and report everything to Mr. Oh.

500
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,697
You little--

501
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,449
For your information,

502
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,952
I have excellent vision.

503
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,746
It's 15-15.

504
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,626
That little brat.

505
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,833
Look what the hag did.

506
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,044
What was she thinking stashing money here?

507
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,715
Dad.

508
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,554
What are you doing?

509
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,223
Well,

510
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:43,435
I'm trying to figure out
what was on the deceased's mind.

511
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,231
Can you figure it out by doing that?

512
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,692
Yes, I can.

513
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,237
But the deceased can't speak.

514
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,325
They can't speak vocally
as they did when they were alive.

515
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,703
That's why we try to read their mind.

516
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,831
