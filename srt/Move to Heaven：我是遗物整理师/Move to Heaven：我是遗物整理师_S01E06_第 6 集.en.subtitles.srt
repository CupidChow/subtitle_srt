1
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,199
Hey, janitor.

2
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,828
Take out my golf club bag.

3
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,788
Okay, sure, sir.

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,798
-Make it quick!
-I'm coming!

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,175
He's frustratingly slow.

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,771
-What's going on?
-What happened?

7
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,738
Mr. Kim In-su?

8
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,699
You can't leave yet.

9
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,826
You should see our chief doctor first.

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,036
Please come follow me.

11
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,906
Excuse me.

12
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,908
Sir.

13
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,871
I'm sorry, but this is a hospital,

14
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,957
so smoking is prohibited on the premises.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,209
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,378
Well--

17
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,631
Sir, I can take the cigarette butt. Here.

18
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,550
Goodness, no. It's okay.

19
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,218
Don't worry about it.

20
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,303
Okay, then.

21
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,640
Well, have a great day, sir.

22
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,558
Sure.

23
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,275
"Sir"?

24
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,865
JASEONG NURSING CARE CENTER

25
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,326
LAWYER OH HYUN-CHANG

26
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,834
Mr. Oh!

27
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,756
I've been thinking
and decided to check with you.

28
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,716
I heard Geu-ru's uncle is a murderer.

29
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,552
It can't be true, can it?

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,137
Where did you hear that?

31
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,182
OMG.

32
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,516
Is it true?

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,852
Oh my goodness. I can't believe this.

34
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,312
Where I heard doesn't matter.

35
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,855
What was he thinking?

36
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,483
How could he leave Geu-ru to a murderer?

37
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,986
Can a murderer be a guardian?
Isn't it against the law?

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,698
If you knew all this,
why didn't you stop Uncle Jeong-u?

39
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,200
What kind of lawyer are you?

40
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,827
Aren't you supposed
to protect your clients?

41
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,625
I'm done.

42
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,211
To be exact, Mr. Cho is not a murderer.

43
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,632
He nearly killed an opponent in a game,
but the victim didn't die.

44
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,968
So he wasn't punished for manslaughter.

45
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,264
As far as I know, there's no reason
to see him as a threat to Geu-ru.

46
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,933
Did something happen
that I don't know about?

47
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,059
No, but--

48
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,021
Has Mr. Cho put Geu-ru in danger
or threatened him?

49
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,189
Shit.

50
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,402
I felt like he has, but…

51
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,113
not really.

52
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,240
Has he caused any inconvenience

53
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,825
or harm for Geu-ru?

54
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,705
Somehow I felt like he has,

55
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
but not really.

56
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,585
Has he done any harm to Move to Heaven
by inappropriate behaviors?

57
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,379
It seems like he has all the time,

58
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,339
but not really.

59
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,763
Na-mu, what if you didn't hear
that Mr. Cho was a murderer?

60
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,060
I still don't like him,
but I wouldn't be scared of him either.

61
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,445
Still, there's one thing
I don't understand.

62
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,281
Aren't you worried
even if knowing all that?

63
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,116
No, I'm not.

64
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,993
How come?

65
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,037
Geu-ru has this good tree called Na-mu.

66
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,376
Have a good day.

67
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,973
What are you doing here?

68
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,725
We got no job today.

69
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,311
That's how a useless newbie's mind works.

70
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,270
What?

71
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,857
A helpful staff like me knows better.
I'm here to do prep work,

72
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,485
check the devices,
and work on marketing strategies

73
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,236
although we got no job.

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,364
It's called taking ownership.

75
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,407
I wouldn't say it's for our company,

76
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,493
but what I can tell is

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:13,081
just a little cheap excuse
to stick around Geu-ru all day long.

78
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,083
"All day long"?

79
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,628
Mom!

80
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,464
What does he mean by that?

81
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,133
I don't get it.
Aren't you studying for the exam?

82
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,511
Did you lie to me?

83
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,388
Actually, you know--

84
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,224
It's not like I--

85
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,356
How do you do?
I should've introduced myself sooner.

86
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,024
I am Geu-ru's uncle.

87
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,528
You must be Na-mu's mother.

88
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,197
I'm also sorry for the late introduction.

89
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,824
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

90
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,242
I was only joking.

91
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,870
Since I just moved in,

92
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,957
I'm not doing a good job
with Geu-ru and the work.

93
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,669
So Na-mu is worried all day long,
and that's what I meant by it.

94
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,130
Oh, is that so?

95
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,091
She may be young, but she's very bright.

96
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:09,178
I've been wondering whom she takes after.
Now that I see it is you.

97
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,849
People say my Na-mu is
a chip off the old block, me.

98
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,561
I won't bother her as much
since she studies for something important.

99
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,980
I apologize for that.

100
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,940
You don't need to.

101
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,484
-Na-mu.
-Yes?

102
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,111
You got to go to study now.

103
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,196
Yes, that's right.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,532
Okay. From now on,

105
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,536
stop bothering me, and be good to Geu-ru.
I don't want to worry anymore.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,501
Oh no, I'm late. Mom, I have to go now.

107
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,715
Man, even good-for-nothing can be useful.

108
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,552
It looks like he isn't too bad after all.

109
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,763
-Okay, have a good day.
-Sure.

110
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,563
Uncle!

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,356
-Uncle!
-What is it?

112
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,444
We got a deposit for a job,
but I don't recall getting a request.

113
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,737
I don't understand.

114
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,071
What do you mean?

115
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,533
Oh, I remember now. I received the call.

116
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,035
Three days ago.

117
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,162
And he requested to come on the 1st.

118
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,875
Oh no. It's today. Darn it.

119
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,920
-Is it today?
-Yes.

120
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,379
He asked to come today.

121
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,633
We got nothing else to do,
so we can do it, right?

122
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,849
Since I joined you,
it seems like orders have flooded in.

123
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,268
Not orders. They're requests.

124
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,480
We say "order" when ordering chicken.

125
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,152
And when Dad was here,
we had three times more requests than now.

126
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,118
Something is wrong. Na-mu isn't here yet.

127
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,871
We must ask her to come.
Or else, she'll be mad again.

128
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,915
No need.

129
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,168
Na-mu will be on leave
from Move to Heaven for a while.

130
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
For a personal reason.

131
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,897
Your call cannot be connected--

132
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,190
Let's go up there first.

133
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,948
Hello.

134
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,326
We're from Move to Heaven.

135
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,336
Is nobody home?

136
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
Shit.

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,272
Call the police now.

138
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,706
WE'RE LEAVING THIS WORLD TOGETHER

139
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,875
WE APOLOGIZE TO THE ONES
WHO CAME TO CLEAN UP AFTER US

140
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,236
Hi, Geu-ru.

141
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,489
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

142
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,203
-It must've been shocking.
-It caught me off guard.

143
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,539
By the way, what happened?

144
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,333
When did you say you got this request?

145
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,253
Three days ago, a man called

146
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,715
-saying his name was--
-Mr. Kim In-su.

147
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,469
-Are you sure it was Mr. Kim In-su?
-Yes.

148
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,928
Why?

149
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,098
One of the deceased is named
Kim In-su, the husband.

150
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,979
That means he requested himself
when he was alive.

151
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,731
What?

152
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,984
He decided to leave for good
before he called you.

153
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,072
This is a social worker
from the ward office.

154
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,035
How do you do?
I'm Son U-rim, a social worker.

155
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,371
I was in charge of these two.

156
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,876
Mrs. Lee Mi-seon was a long-term patient
at a nursing home,

157
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,463
and Mr. Kim In-su was a janitor
at an apartment complex.

158
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,968
After I heard the news, I found out
that he was fired a month ago.

159
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,639
I think that was a trigger
to make this decision.

160
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,681
Shit.

161
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,935
Is something wrong?

162
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,647
Decision? A decision to do what?

163
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:39,485
To drag his sick wife out of the hospital
and drug her and himself to death?

164
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,864
If you wanted to kill yourself,
just do it alone. What was he thinking?

165
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,200
She didn't deserve this!

166
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,871
Do you think it's easy for the elderly
to decide to end their lives at their age?

167
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,623
What's not easy about it?

168
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,877
To make the call on someone else's life
and call it responsibility?

169
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,295
It's the same as a murder.

170
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,966
A double suicide? How do we know
that she agreed to this?

171
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,643
Got a smoke?

172
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,728
I left it in the van.

173
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm going for a smoke.

174
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,987
We don't have anyone's number
who can receive their belongings.

175
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,988
Do you know any?

176
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,367
They don't have any family members.

177
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,999
I'm afraid there seems to be no one
who can take their belongings.

178
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,211
Still, we will organize them.

179
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,678
Don't pay a silent tribute or any shit
to a man like him.

180
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,849
Don't try your best.
Just give a lick and a promise.

181
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,812
A loser like him won't go to heaven,
so don't even pray for him.

182
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,942
I was told not to say carelessly
when you don't know their stories.

183
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,903
Okay.

184
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,113
I guess your wonderful dad said that.

185
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:11,035
Anyway, I won't clean
a speck of dust in there. Understand?

186
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,454
Okay, then,

187
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,790
today's pay will be deducted
from your monthly salary.

188
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,168
Hey, don't be so quick to--

189
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,422
-I'd like to give you a hand if it's okay.
-Sure.

190
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,514
Gosh, darn it.

191
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,206
Mr. Kim In-su and Mrs. Lee Mi-seon,

192
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,210
you passed away on May 31st, 2020.

193
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,965
I'm Han Geu-ru, a trauma cleaner

194
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,592
from Move to Heaven.

195
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:14,181
I'll now begin to help you
with your final move,

196
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,058
Mr. Kim In-su and Mrs. Lee Mi-seon.

197
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,286
IN APPRECIATION OF KIM IN-SU

198
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,006
THE LATE KIM IN-SU & LEE MI-SEON
REST IN PEACE

199
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,696
Uh?

200
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,448
But you said--

201
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,576
We need to finish
before the truck guy gets here.

202
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,163
It's not that I changed my mind.

203
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,875
It's just that I didn't want
to get an earful from him.

204
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,794
-Understand?
-I understand.

205
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,046
Still, you'll only get
33 % of today's pay.

206
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,591
Whoa, now I can see

207
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,303
that you're such a heartless,
cold-blooded, penny-pincher boss.

208
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,099
I have a heart
and warm blood like everybody else.

209
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,309
My blood type is A.

210
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,644
And as for penny-pincher…

211
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,189
I'm not sure what that means.

212
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,316
Forget it.

213
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,986
So we're done
when taking these out, right?

214
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,497
Man, it's suffocating.

215
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,999
Hey, let's open the window.

216
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,170
It's the rooftop floor,
so no one can see us like in an apartment.

217
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,591
We can open the window, right?
Shoot, it's stuffy in here.

218
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,597
What's that?

219
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,974
A door?

220
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,442
Geu-ru. Han Geu-ru.

221
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,777
You need to see this.

222
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,752
Oh my!

223
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,880
What's all this?

224
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,682
Wow.

225
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,583
Does this look to you like something made

226
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,169
by an evil man who killed his good wife?

227
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,089
I couldn't care less.

228
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,427
Two of us are looking at the same thing,

229
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,722
but one sees love
while the other sees hate.

230
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
Do you want to bet?

231
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,146
At least this shows the world I believe,
and I'll make sure you see that.

232
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,357
Hello?

233
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,568
See what?

234
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,950
Gosh, it's going to take forever
to clean these out.

235
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,161
They look fine.
Maybe we can take and sell them?

236
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,164
No, we can't.

237
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,125
We have to return them.

238
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,168
How? We don't know where they're from.

239
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,337
We have to go to Block 105.

240
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:38,922
Block 105?

241
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,384
There are so many Block 105s out there.

242
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,846
Don't be ridiculous.
Let's clean these out and leave.

243
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,682
Gosh, there are so many.

244
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,524
BLOCK 105, WOOHYEONG APARTMENT

245
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,903
Right there.

246
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,990
We must go to Block 105
of Woohyeong Apartment.

247
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,168
Hey, are you really going to take them
to the apartment there?

248
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,962
I'm leaving without you.

249
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,965
I mean it!

250
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,346
Is this Jaseong Nursing Care Center?

251
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,556
I called you earlier about--

252
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,224
Yes, I'm going there now.

253
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,809
Okay.

254
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,977
Hey, there.

255
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,231
Get in.

256
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,443
Sorry?

257
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,236
Or not.

258
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,409
WOOHYEONG

259
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,581
Who is it?

260
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,125
I'm here to return your plant.

261
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,878
What?

262
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,130
It's the plant we threw away.

263
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,966
-What a hassle.
-Thank you.

264
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,432
He passed away on May 31st, 2020.

265
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,769
Why did you bring it back
from the dead man?

266
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,230
It brings bad luck.

267
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,275
I'm here to return your plant.

268
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,111
No, thank you.

269
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:32,911
Mr. Kim In-su passed away
on May 31st, 2020.

270
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,707
Mr. Kim--

271
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,878
Mr. Kim passed away? Are you sure?

272
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,463
Yes.

273
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,882
Oh, poor Mr. Kim.

274
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,570
Mr. Kim, would you please come out?

275
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,990
Okay.

276
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,200
What is it?

277
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,871
Ta-da!
It's an air conditioner for your office.

278
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,664
Oh my goodness, Min-ji.

279
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,709
I don't understand.

280
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,711
I raised the money with my friends.

281
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:27,799
I was still short, but my parents
gave allowance for my birthday in advance.

282
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,510
Do you like it? Your office will be cool.

283
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:35,015
Did you really get this for me?
For my office?

284
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,184
Hang on a second.

285
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,687
Hey, kid. Who says you could do that?

286
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,314
Sorry?

287
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,317
I bought this with my money, sir.

288
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,737
An air conditioner doesn't run on its own.

289
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,573
Who's going to pay for the electricity?

290
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,616
You?

291
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,452
It won't cost much.

292
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,038
How do you know if it won't cost much?

293
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,666
Sir, please calm down.

294
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll use it for a moment only on hot days.

295
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,213
How can I trust you?

296
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,634
Humans tend to seek comfort and luxury
if they can afford it.

297
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,552
And what's with you, really?

298
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,262
If it's too hot,

299
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:19,267
buy and use it with your own money
and take it with you when you leave.

300
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,731
You expect us to get you the AC unit
and pay for the electricity as well?

301
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,441
Are you a beggar or something?

302
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,947
You're crossing the line a bit, sir.

303
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm not anywhere near the line!

304
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,287
As you expect to get help for everything,
you end up where you are, being a janitor.

305
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,457
You should be ashamed
and turn down this little girl's help.

306
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,253
Okay, I understand.

307
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,089
I won't use the air conditioner.

308
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,423
Mr. Kim!

309
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,426
Use fans instead.
Two fans will be good enough.

310
00:25:58,974 --> 00:25:59,849
It's okay.

311
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,977
I still appreciate your gesture.

312
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,603
Okay? Thank you.

313
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,523
Yeah.

314
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,040
What?

315
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,459
-Do you know this place?
-Sorry?

316
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,379
You didn't bother to use the GPS.

317
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,297
Ah, that.

318
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,634
Aren't you getting out?

319
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,137
Hold on.

320
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,850
-Now that you're here, stay put.
-What for?

321
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,520
You need to wait and hear
the truth of Mr. Kim In-su.

322
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,274
Okay, let's suppose I misunderstood him.

323
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,735
What would you want me to do?

324
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,278
Say sorry to you?

325
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,738
Of course, you should.

326
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,700
Not to me, but to Mr. Kim.

327
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,537
Have you heard
of defamation of the deceased?

328
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,913
What now?

329
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,583
Don't go anywhere, okay?

330
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,136
What's with her?

331
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,203
Sang-gu.

332
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,793
I heard you got out.

333
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,339
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,968
How have you been doing?

335
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,972
You tell me.

336
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,773
Thanks to you, we can keep Su-cheol alive
when he's supposed to be dead already.

337
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,319
I should say thank you,
but I can't bring myself to say it.

338
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,781
I'm sorry.

339
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,742
You'll know if you stick around here

340
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,663
what it's like

341
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,457
to be in a living death.

342
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,093
What happened?

343
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,512
He's not dead,

344
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,140
but he's not alive either.

345
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,768
His brain is too damaged.
He probably won't wake up.

346
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,108
If he is not dead,
it means he breathes and his heart beats.

347
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,319
-Without consciousness.
-You fucking bitch.

348
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,407
It's all your fault.

349
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,034
He was laughing
and talking with me till yesterday.

350
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:09,122
If you didn't set us up like this--
God damn it.

351
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,460
Don't blame me. How can it be my fault?

352
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:18,590
I told you to fight, not to kill him.

353
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,014
If Su-cheol dies,

354
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,934
I won't let you die easily, either.

355
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,145
Are you sure you can handle it?

356
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,063
Bring him back no matter what.

357
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,552
The sleeping pills they took were

358
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,138
the ones Mrs. Lee got here.

359
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,060
She probably has saved them for long.

360
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,942
She always said her wish was to die
a day before her husband dies.

361
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,404
And as for Mr. Kim,

362
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,575
he had terminal pancreatic cancer.

363
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,707
Gosh.

364
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,170
Mr. Kim In-su?

365
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,633
You can't leave yet.
You should see our chief doctor first.

366
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,134
Come follow me.

367
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:06,322
NOTICE OF DISMISSAL

368
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,548
What brings you here at this hour?

369
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,176
Nothing.

370
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,013
Just to see you.

371
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,644
Is everything okay?

372
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,897
Sure. Plus, I have good news.

373
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,070
I came here to grant your wish.

374
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,823
Well, now…

375
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,577
let's go home.

376
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,626
Really?

377
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,076
Goodness.

378
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,912
I got no time for this.

379
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,458
I should prepare
their portraits for the funeral.

380
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,210
Wait.

381
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,595
-Are they the deceased earlier?
-Yes.

382
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,639
Why do you ask?

383
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,892
Excuse me, sir.

384
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,395
Have a great day, sir.

385
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,526
Shall we?

386
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,371
What's going to happen to them?

387
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,749
I mean their funeral and so on.

388
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:08,087
Since they have no family,
they're classified as unattended deaths.

389
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,009
Luckily, the city offers funerals
for people without a family,

390
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,428
so we'll give a small one for them.

391
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,598
Good to hear.

392
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,148
THE LATE KIM IN-SU & LEE MI-SEON
REST IN PEACE

393
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,194
Geu-ru, you need to give up this time.

394
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,614
There's no one
you can hand over this box to.

395
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,868
How did you deal
with a situation like this before?

396
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,788
I heard Uncle Jeong-u
burned it separately.

397
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,706
Then that's how we do it this time.

398
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,124
Han Geu-ru.

399
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,959
It's time to move on.

400
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,754
-Goodness.
-No!

401
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,005
Not yet!

402
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,299
Come on.

403
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,010
You really don't know how to say yes.

404
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,346
You'd better let it go. Come on.

405
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,681
I wish there's anybody close to them.

406
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,853
I wish I can find anybody who knows them
and pays a visit to their funeral.

407
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,022
That would be wonderful,

408
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,941
but you also heard there was no one.

409
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,027
There isn't even a number to call.
What can we do?

410
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,157
Geu-ru, come back here!

411
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,034
Uncle Sang-gu!

412
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,038
All right, Geu-ru.

413
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,124
We'll find them after the funeral, okay?

414
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,335
You need to get ready for the funeral.
You're going, right?

415
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,380
As you said,
they'd be lonely if no one shows up.

416
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,173
So, you shouldn't be late either.

417
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,217
Okay?

418
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,429
JISAN FUNERAL HALL

419
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,589
THE LATE KIM IN-SU, THE LATE LEE MI-SEON

420
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,342
These are the flowers
Mr. Kim took care of for Mrs. Lee.

421
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,061
ASTER: PRECIOUS MEMORIES
GLOBE AMARANTH: UNCHANGING LOVE

422
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,939
ROYAL AZALEA: JOY OF LOVE
HYACINTH: HUMBLE LOVE

423
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:33,941
Aster.

424
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,651
Precious memories.

425
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,237
Peace lily.

426
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,156
Thoughtful love.

427
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,576
Dracaena.

428
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,661
Keeping a promise.

429
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,622
Dwarf umbrella tree.

430
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
Luck and love.

431
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,709
Lily.

432
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,794
Pure love.

433
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,005
Globe amaranth.

434
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,965
Unchanging love.

435
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,052
Iris.

436
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,970
Joyful news.

437
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:05,932
Camellia.

438
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,100
I love you.

439
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,148
Camellia means "I love you."
in the flower language.

440
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,734
Mr. Kim taught me that.

441
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,735
Min-ji!

442
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,698
Mr. Kim, Min-ji is here.

443
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:50,184
Wow, I don't know who the deceased is,
but the family must be pretty affluent.

444
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,145
It's the executive's mother
at Jaehwa construction.

445
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
-Really?
-That VIP hall.

446
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,066
I see.

447
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,877
JAEHWA CONSTRUCTION LABOR UNION
REST IN PEACE

448
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:29,098
It's a th-- thief! There's a thief!

449
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,433
-You idiot!
-Thief!

450
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,143
Shoot.

451
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:34,937
Gosh.

452
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,732
Taking someone's stuff
without their consent is theft.

453
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,150
It's a criminal act.

454
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,445
I'm not stealing it.
I'm just borrowing it temporarily.

455
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,780
I was going to return it tomorrow morning.

456
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,073
Still, it's wrong.

457
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,618
Hey, take a look around.

458
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,163
We have nothing,

459
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,499
but they have too many
to put them all together.

460
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,461
Nobody will notice even if one is missing.

461
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,380
They'll probably
throw them away in the end, you know.

462
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,717
Do we really need a wreath?

463
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,055
I wouldn't say we must have it,

464
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,476
but it'd be sad if we don't have any.

465
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,311
Why would it be sad?

466
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,188
Think about it.

467
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,484
It's like a card saying
there's someone who wishes

468
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,944
the deceased would reach heaven safely.

469
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,324
-Still, taking someone's stuff--
-All right.

470
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,409
I won't take it. Are you happy now?

471
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,832
Man, nobody would notice
even if I took one.

472
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,918
You're being too inflexible.

473
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,797
REST IN PEACE, JAEHWA

474
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,423
JAEHWA CONSTRUCTION

475
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,883
JAEHWA FOUNDATION

MANAGER KIM IN-SU

478
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,401
1981, JAEHWA CONSTRUCTION
KIM IN-SU

479
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,033
-I found them.
-Found what now?

480
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,870
People who knew Mr. Kim
and can come to his funeral.

481
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:15,871
They're here.

482
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,336
Geu-ru!

483
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,548
Assistant Manager Kim In-su from 1981.
He's at Hall Five now.

484
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,719
-Do you know him?
-Of course, I don't.

485
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,513
This business card looks archaic.

486
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,348
The company logo was so tacky.

487
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,102
You weren't even born in 1981, were you?

488
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,272
-Senior Manager--
-You can't do this here. Please leave.

489
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,525
I'm sorry.

490
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,819
-You can't do that in here. Stop it.
-Wait.

491
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,288
Who did you say he was?

492
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,749
Senior Manager Kim In-su from 1998.
He's in Hall Five right now.

493
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,172
Senior Manager Kim In-su, you said?

494
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,924
Yes, sir.

495
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,295
Well,

496
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:50,049
when I was still
a working-level associate,

497
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,388
Senior Manager Kim was always there.

498
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,235
I promise

499
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,778
KIM IN-SU
JAEHWA CONSTRUCTION

500
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,490
I'll keep this name card for a long time.

501
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,203
See you again.

502
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:36,011
How beautiful it is

503
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,724
To look at someone from the back

504
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,310
Who confidently knows
it's their time to leave

505
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,772
My love that endured

506
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,986
A season of passion in spring is falling

507
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,323
Blossoms fall everywhere

508
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,452
I am surrounded
by the blessings of farewell

509
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,124
And now it's time to leave

510
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,752
Toward an exuberant forest

511
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:15,884
And to autumn
when trees begin to bear fruit

512
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,512
My youth

513
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,725
Dies like a flower does

514
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,581
You lived a tough life.

515
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,752
Please rest in peace,

516
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,047
Mr. Kim and Mrs. Lee.

517
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,218
You deserve it.

518
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,494
Wait!

519
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,956
Thank you.

520
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,667
Sorry?

521
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,836
I've never been proud like I was today
when holding a funeral

522
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,213
for those without family.

523
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,340
All thanks to Move to Heaven.

524
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,729
Okay.

525
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,107
Good work.

526
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,119
Goodness.

527
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,329
They're pink.

528
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,581
What?

529
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,334
Uncle, your ears turn pink.

530
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,879
What are you talking about, kid?

531
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,673
Gosh.

532
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,467
It happens when your capillary vessels
suddenly expand

533
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,845
because your heart starts beating faster.

534
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,057
That little-- Hey! It's nothing like that!

535
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,650
Wreath delivery.

536
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,403
A wreath?

537
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,699
You must be mistaken.
There's no one who'd send it here.

538
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,117
I got the right address.

539
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:02,050
MOVE TO HEAVEN, REST IN PEACE

540
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,136
Didn't you say we don't need a wreath?

541
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,346
As you said,

542
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,433
it'd be sad not to receive any card

543
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,853
from someone who wishes
they'd arrive at heaven safely.

544
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,482
There are many people

545
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,986
who wish Mr. Kim In-su
and Mrs. Lee Mi-seon reach heaven well.

546
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,739
So I sent a card on our behalf.

547
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,753
-What's this?
-It's one of the plants Mr. Kim had.

548
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,463
So what's got to do with me?

549
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,758
Ms. Son U-rim, the social worker,
asked me to give it to you.

550
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,676
You should take care of it from now.

551
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,179
I hate taking care of anything.

552
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,765
Handling you is already too much.

553
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,475
This is called dahlias.

554
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,478
"Happy to know about your heart."

555
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,566
-What?
-That's what dahlias means.

556
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,486
"Happy to know about your heart."

557
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,570
I--

558
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,833
Right.

559
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,420
Shoot.

560
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,343
SU-JIN

561
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,847
Yes, Su-jin.

562
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,099
Su-cheol is--

563
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,226
he's in critical condition!

564
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,606
Okay, I'll be right there.

565
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:30,824
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

566
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,326
