00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,385
SEHA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,012
Hey, you!

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,596
Don't move, damn it!

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,393
Hey, come here, fuck!

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,645
Hey, come here!

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,148
Bring me morphine, targin, and fentanyl.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,899
Now, you fuckers!

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,277
-Don't move.
-Take it easy, sir.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,988
The wound on your shoulder
needs to be treated first.

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,198
-I'm a doctor, so--
-Cut the crap.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,576
Bring me the drugs. Now! Stay still.

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,494
Okay, I'll give you the drugs,

13
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,830
-but let her go first.
-I don't trust you!

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,837
Don't move.

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,927
When I approach you with this,
you let her go, okay?

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,640
Stay close.

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
Stay still.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,188
Stay still.

19
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,067
Fuck! Shit!

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,236
Let go, shit!

21
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,030
-Let go!
-Calm down, sir!

22
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,491
Let go! Damn it!

23
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,617
Shit!

24
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,246
Don't move! Stay still!

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,087
He's a so-called human murder weapon.

26
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,299
He sent an opponent to the other side
with one punch.

27
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,217
A real monster.

28
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,554
Geu-ru! Get away from him!

29
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,222
You are in danger!

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,726
Get away from him, Geu-ru!
You're in danger!

31
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,935
Han Geu-ru!

32
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,247
So you are a cop now, huh?

33
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,415
-You look good in the uniform.
-Thank you.

34
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,502
Na-mu.

35
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:13,878
Come here.

36
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,759
Hey, Jun-yeong was on patrol
and came here to say hello.

37
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,722
Anyway, you got the looks and manners.
What a perfect guy you are.

38
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,269
You're too kind. I was just in the area
and saw you out here.

39
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,063
So I just came by to say hello.

40
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,274
You can be straightforward with me.

41
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,987
You wanted to check in on her, right?
Since you two were kids,

42
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,865
I knew you always admired Na-mu.
Everyone in the neighborhood knows that.

43
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,076
What?

44
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,077
Wait a minute.

45
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,163
Are you guys being awkward with each other

46
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,208
just because you haven't met
for a few years?

47
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
Right?

48
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,295
-Cut it out!
-What?

49
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,380
Actually, a few days ago--

50
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,175
Right, Park Jun-yeong!
It's been ages, hasn't it?

51
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,345
How long has it been?
Maybe three years?

52
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,139
-Right? That's right.
-Three years?

53
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,726
A rookie like you
shouldn't be slacking off.

54
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,771
I'm sure you must be super busy.
Are you not?

55
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,524
-Don't push me. I was about to go.
-Jun-yeong.

56
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,571
Visit us often,Â and bring your coworkers
with you next time.

57
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,614
I'll be generous with food.

58
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,868
-Thank you for the food.
-Bye.

59
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,785
Okay.

60
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,875
It's a secret that I work with Geu-ru.
I'll kill you if you talk.

61
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,168
It depends on you.

62
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,962
-Ms. Oh!
-Yes?

63
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,422
CHICKEN BOWL

64
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,552
-I'll come by again.
-Sure, have a good day.

65
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,275
What? What do you want to say?

66
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,778
Did it rain
only in front of our restaurant?

67
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:07,658
Dear Ms. Oh drooled over him so much
that it's like there was a downpour here.

68
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,703
I'll take you home, Geu-ru.

69
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,748
Taking him home?
He lives right across from here!

70
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,503
You think he can't find his way?
Is that why you take him home every day?

71
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,714
On top of that,
you go over there three times a day,

72
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,176
cook for him, and feed him
as if you were his mom!

73
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,179
Why don't you cook for your mom and dad?

74
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,973
-You might be awarded by the UN.
-Cut it out!

75
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,475
-That's enough!
-You little--

76
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,394
-Geu-ru, let's go.
-Yoon Na-mu!

77
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,187
Watch your mouth. I'm your mother!

78
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,942
Na-mu's mother,
Na-mu doesn't cook for me at my house.

79
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,026
What?

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,279
My dad always cooked for us,
and she only ate.

81
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,866
And even now,
she only eats what I prepare.

82
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,952
I do all the dishes too.

83
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,871
She does nothing. She just sits there.

84
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,208
So don't be mad, and don't fight with her.

85
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,174
This is Move to Heaven.

86
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,718
Can you come right away? I'll pay more.

87
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,054
-Sorry?
-We're rather in a hurry.

88
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,889
I see.

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,979
This is Move to Heaven with love and care.
How may I assist you?

90
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,900
Yes, that can be arranged right away.

91
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,694
Okay, thank you.

92
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,156
It's an urgent request.

93
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,660
Oh my!

94
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
Good grief.

95
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,956
I can't believe we already have a fly.

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,626
Let's get a bug spray.

97
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:16,496
ONE VILLAGE TOWNHOUSE

98
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,765
Discard everything

99
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,684
except for his furniture
and electronic devices.

100
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,687
-You mean everything?
-Yes, please.

101
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,108
They said it'd hurt them more
to see their son's belongings.

102
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,902
Okay, I understand.

103
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,905
Thank you for the work.

104
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,448
No problem.

105
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,624
Damn!

106
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,877
I'm in charge of accounting.

107
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,964
I counted them all.
Don't you dare try to pocket any.

108
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,637
Why were you in such a rush
to clean out his things?

109
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,182
Did you have to press me so hard?

110
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,894
-I was going to do it eventually--
-Eventually? When?

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,733
I know you will never throw away
even his old shirt.

112
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,318
Don't use me as an excuse.

113
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,364
You're doing this because you heard
that person is coming back.

114
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,292
-You can start with the bedroom there.
-Sure.

115
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,627
Mr. Jung Soo-hyun,

116
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,132
you passed away on May 12th, 2020.

117
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:39,972
We're trauma cleaners from Move to Heaven.
I'm Han-Geu-ru.

118
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,642
Oh, I'm Yoon Na-mu.

119
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,103
I'm Cho Sang-gu.

120
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,147
That's us.

121
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,231
Now we'll begin

122
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,402
to help you with your final move,
Mr. Jung Soo-hyun.

123
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,079
Uncle and Na-mu can start from here.

124
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,997
Okay.

125
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,131
DIPLOMA, JUNG SOO-HYUN

126
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,883
So the dead guy was a doctor?

127
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,053
He was such a young
and good-looking doctor.

128
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,972
And I heard he was their only son.

129
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,266
His parents must be devastated.

130
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,561
It's all lie when people say
everyone is equal in death.

131
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,525
It's better to be young, good-looking,
and a doctor even when you're dead.

132
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,485
because people treat you differently.

133
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,945
That's not what I did!

134
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,115
Are you sure about that?

135
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,493
Such a shame.

136
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,078
You're right.

137
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,330
I did, but I couldn't help it.

138
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,473
EMERGENCY MEDICINE
DR. JUNG SOO-HYUN

139
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,387
We should've said yes
if we had known he'd end up like this.

140
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,014
He's my son.

141
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,183
I never allow such things in my family!

142
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,229
Do you still care about your reputation
when our son is dead?

143
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,320
Well, excuse me.

144
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,241
You're his family. You need to see this.

145
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,713
Do you know who this is?

146
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,090
Why do you ask?

147
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,344
The deceased left the letter
for this person, so I must deliver it.

148
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,013
That's not your business.
Just do as you are told.

149
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,850
-Let's go.
-No!

150
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,018
No!

151
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,144
It can't be!

152
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,232
What? What's wrong?

153
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,984
No!

154
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,486
Hey, what are you doing?

155
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,030
You burned your hand!

156
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,325
I know you are an idiot but not this much.

157
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,537
You're human, not a robot.
Why did you put it there?

158
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,290
-Uncle Sang-gu!
-You said he wasn't stupid.

159
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,041
You said he was darn smart.

160
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,503
He should know betterÂ what'd happen
if he puts his hand in the fire?

161
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,130
Do you think he doesn't know?

162
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,632
It's all burnt!

163
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,887
The heart Mr. Jung left
for his loved one is gone.

164
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,763
I need to give it to that person,

165
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,558
so that they can read,
but it's all gone now.

166
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,519
Forget it.
We need to treat your hand first.

167
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,814
I can't just leave it here.
I must take it with me.

168
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,067
How are you going to do that?
It's burnt to ashes.

169
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,869
Staring at the ashes
won't turn them back into a letter.

170
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,497
His parents must've had aÂ reason
to want everything gone.

171
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,003
"It was his only wish."

172
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,967
"We should've said yes
if we had known he'd end up like this."

173
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,389
"He's my son.
I never allow such things in my family!"

174
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,809
-What's that?
-That's what they said.

175
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,314
I thought he works like a camera,
but he can be a recorder too?

176
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,192
Hey, it's a compliment.

177
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,946
I got it.

178
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,575
He had a lover but had to break up
because his parents didn't approve.

179
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,662
And then, this sudden tragedy
happened to this doctor.

180
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,623
So it means
you are going to look for a woman

181
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,792
this doctor guy was in love with?

182
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,043
Oh no.

183
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,544
What do you mean by "you"?

184
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,129
It should be "we."

185
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,048
You also work for Move to Heaven.

186
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,049
Man.

187
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,928
Are we private detectives,
not trauma cleaners?

188
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,138
We find money and people,

189
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,433
and now we deliver things?
Why not feeding our clients too?

190
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,103
Let me get this straight.

191
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,064
To be exact,
Geu-ru did all the work, not you.

192
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,774
You just tagged along.

193
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,235
That was
because I didn't put my mind to it.

194
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,405
Once I do,
I can do everything he does, you know.

195
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,741
Then do it.
Try to find out who his lover is.

196
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,327
If you find her, I'll eat my hat.

197
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,122
Let's not eat anybody's hat.
Instead, we'll have--

198
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,874
A finger flick?

199
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,009
No way!

200
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,515
Do you find this sort of thing scary?
That's so unlike you.

201
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,352
I'm not scared.
I just think a finger flick is childish.

202
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
Let's both bet 50,000 won instead.

203
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,523
-50,000 won?
-Yes.

204
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,567
Don't back out.

205
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,736
Okay.

206
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,696
Let's see what we have here.

207
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,701
It's so obvious.

208
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,621
I think she's a musician
based on the flyers he kept.

209
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,250
Classical music lovers
always keep these things.

210
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,919
He had a huge collection of albums
at his house.

211
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,345
-What's that?
-It's an end pin stopper.

212
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,182
What's that for?

213
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,894
It's used when cello players
hold their instrument in place.

214
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,145
Oh, I see.

215
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,982
Then she might be a cellorist?

216
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,278
"Cellorist"? Isn't it a cellist?

217
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,738
Right, a cellist.

218
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,741
Come on. I said a cellist!

219
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,517
Cellists!

220
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,019
Here they are.

221
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,108
-This one!
-Her!

222
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
-It must be her.
-Why?

223
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,695
Look at her. They'd make a good couple.

224
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,240
If you put it that way, she's better.

225
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,409
-She's a match.
-What? She'd be a better match.

226
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,120
FIRST CONCERT IN KOREA, MAY 16TH

227
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,123
Mr. Jung was going to go to this concert
tomorrow night.

228
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,084
We can find her there.

229
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,675
May 16th? Yes, it's tomorrow.

230
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,318
FIRST BLANC'S FIRST CONCERT IN KOREA

231
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,155
Performers are in rehearsal now,
so you can't meet them.

232
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,159
We're truly sorry,
but this is extremely important.

233
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,661
Why don't you contact them in person?

234
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:26,540
I told you so many times.
We don't know how to reach them.

235
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,834
If we knew, why would we be asking you?

236
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,253
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

237
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,714
I have to use the restroom.

238
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
I have to use the restroom.

239
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,969
And I have to go now.

240
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,014
Gosh.

241
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,643
Every man for his own trade, they say.

242
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,645
I'm not trading anything.

243
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,314
I mean your restroom strategy.

244
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,274
We're in here, thanks to your trick.

245
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,567
It wasn't a trick.

246
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,944
-What?
-I really have to go now.

247
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,987
And it's urgent.

248
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,286
Hey.

249
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,706
Oh my.

250
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,334
Are you Kim So-mi?

251
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,800
Excuse me.

252
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,762
-Are you Jennifer Song?
-Yes, I am.

253
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,556
-Is Jung Soo-hyun your friend?
-Who? No.

254
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,768
Oh, he isn't? Sorry about that.

255
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,686
Do you know Jung Soo-hyun?

256
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,730
Jung-- No, I don't.

257
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:32,689
-You don't?
-No.

258
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,774
-Sorry.
-Really?

259
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,109
Sorry about that.

260
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
Oh man.

261
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,752
Did you find her?

262
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,129
No. I don't think I can find her.

263
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,297
Maybe she isn't here.

264
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,017
Wellâ¦

265
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,687
I meanâ¦

266
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,772
Wellâ¦

267
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,105
I think we met with everyone.

268
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,567
Hey!

269
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,737
What took you so long?
I thought you fell asleep in there.

270
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,071
I found the lover.

271
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,240
Yes, we also found them.

272
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,326
But all three of them said no.

273
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,579
None of them was his lover.
They didn't even know him.

274
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,621
That can't be.

275
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,335
His lover, a cellist, is right here.

276
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,714
They said they don't know him.

277
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,300
The one Mr. Jung was in love with isâ¦

278
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,220
this person.

279
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,307
Oh my. Are you sure?

280
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,267
That one?

281
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,605
Ian Park.

282
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,607
This is his lover.

283
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,246
"Soo-hyun."

284
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,462
-Let's keep the schedule as is.
-Okay, then get some rest.

285
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,551
Mr. Jung Soo-hyun.

286
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,891
Do you know him?

287
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,814
No, I don't know anybody by that name.

288
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,732
I see. We're sorry.

289
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey, we should go now.

290
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,404
Are you sure you don't know him?

291
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,156
Mr. Jung Soo-hyun?

292
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,581
I used to know him,

293
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,876
but he's a stranger to me now.

294
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,004
He has nothing to do with me.

295
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,174
Let's get going, okay? Go.

296
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,592
I don't understand.

297
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,306
How can a person you used to know
turn back to a stranger?

298
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,565
When you live in the world, you'll meet
complicated and delicate situations.

299
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,109
I will explain it when we get home.

300
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,485
What are you playing at?

301
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,411
What's that got to do with you
if I knew Jung Soo-hyun or not?

302
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,082
Mr. Jung Soo-hyun

303
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,335
passed away on May 12th, 2020.

304
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,048
What do you mean--

305
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,429
Hey!

306
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,850
I said we should get going.
Look at the time. We're late.

307
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,101
-Let's go now.
-Go.

308
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,729
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry. Move now.

309
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,023
Hurry up now.

310
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,131
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message--

311
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,723
Hello?

312
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,559
Well, actually,

313
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,604
can I talk to Dr. Jung Soo-hyun
from the ER?

314
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,616
Goodness.

315
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,119
You can't just drop the bomb like that
without any buffer.

316
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,080
It's all over now. Let's just go.

317
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,751
Now that we're here,
why not staying for the concert?

318
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,920
You want to stay for this kind of music?

319
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,757
Next door,
your music taste doesn't suit you.

320
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,511
What are you talking about?
I love classical music.

321
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,595
As if!

322
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,890
We can't give this to him now.

323
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,850
We must give it after the concert.

324
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,851
What?

325
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,355
He said he had nothing to do with him,

326
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,565
dead or alive.

327
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,733
Mr. Jung wanted to give it to him.

328
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,986
And it's our job to do so on his behalf.

329
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,406
Are you saying
we should stay for the concert?

330
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,409
Not for me. You guys go ahead without me.

331
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,995
Yeah! Ian is gone!

332
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,080
Report to the police first.

333
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,290
We must find him now.

334
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,626
The concert?
We need to find him to have one!

335
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,593
Did I hear it right?

336
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,678
Ian is gone?

337
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,807
Why did he act like this?
He said he didn't know Mr. Jung.

338
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,642
We must find him.

339
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,145
Hey, Geu-ru!

340
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,022
-Geu-ru.
-Gosh, darn it.

341
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,865
A DOCTOR KILLED BY A PATIENT'S ATTACK

342
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,209
He must be in shock by the news
that his lover is dead.

343
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,128
If I were him,

344
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,758
I'd go to a meaningful place
where we shared a happy memory.

345
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,843
"A happy memory"?

346
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,511
But how would we know that?

347
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,307
Think! I got it!

348
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,019
-The place where they first met?
-Huh?

349
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,527
-It could be some kind of concert hall.
-A concert hall?

350
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,155
There are so many.

351
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,740
What about a club?

352
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,119
You're joking, right?
Would you go to a club in this situation?

353
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,413
-Well, I might--
-No, that's wrong.

354
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,123
Sorry?

355
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,334
The place where Mr. Jung
first met him is--

356
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:02,597
SEHA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

357
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:40,802
IN REMEMBRANCE OF DOCTOR JUNG SOO-HYUN

358
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,641
CHRISTMAS DAY, ONE YEAR AGO

359
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,184
Shoot.

360
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,523
I knew it.

361
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,525
Why? What's going on?

362
00:28:55,608 --> 00:29:00,113
We made a bet on whether you'd be on duty
again this Christmas.

363
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,200
Wow, you're so predictable
that we all can see you through.

364
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,326
You are no fun.

365
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,412
I'm sorry for being so predictable.

366
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,874
Incoming patients from a traffic accident.

367
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,417
This way.

368
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,462
-What do we have here?
-TA, unconscious,

369
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,088
15 minutes of travel time.

370
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,008
-Check his vitalsÂ and prepare to intubate.
-Yes, Doctor.

371
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,885
His leg is bleeding excessively.

372
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,053
I'll take it from here.

373
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,360
Be quiet!

374
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,657
You can speak Korean.

375
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,285
How are you feeling?

376
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,578
Not too bad.

377
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,123
The instrument you valued over your life
seems fine too.

378
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,669
Thanks to a scary doctor.

379
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,133
Could you play me something?

380
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,797
Soo-hyun, eating ice cream in winter
is making my hands cold.

381
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,426
What's wrong with you?

382
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,430
-People can see us.
-No one cares.

383
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,641
-They're watching us.
-No one is.

384
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:28,947
I'm good.

385
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,951
Watch the movie.

386
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,379
Be quiet,Â and watch the movie.

387
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,321
Hand me my phone, please.

388
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,250
What's this?

389
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,008
You got in?

390
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,926
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,761
I haven't decided yet.

392
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,723
What do you mean?
It's San Francisco we're talking about.

393
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,016
You must go.

394
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,560
-But--
-When shall we leave?

395
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,146
I need to apply for leave.

396
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,607
My chief will be flipping out,

397
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,279
but I can take at least two months off
from all the vacation days I never used.

398
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,491
-Really?
-Of course.

399
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,037
What shall we do first?
The weather is good, right?

400
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,914
I've always wanted
to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

401
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,709
Is the food good?
The weather is nice, right?

402
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,669
And what else should we do?

403
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,423
Do I sound too much like a tourist?

404
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,844
Are you sure you want to go?

405
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,059
You think I'm faking?

406
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,771
Let's go, Soo-hyun.

407
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,273
And do whatever you want to do.

408
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,860
If you're happy, that makes me happy too.

409
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,737
So, we should go.

410
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,074
That's great.

411
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,077
Soo-hyun, you are early.

412
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
Let's go.

413
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,872
-Ian.
-Yes?

414
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,588
What's going on?
Did you check in already?

415
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,178
Soo-hyunâ¦

416
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,890
you aren't coming, are you?

417
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,146
Okay, I won't go either, then.

418
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,022
Nonsense.

419
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,276
It's the opportunity you've longed for.

420
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:56,779
Soo-hyun.

421
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,032
Your parents will never change

422
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,327
no matter how much time you give them.

423
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,164
I know.

424
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,001
That's why I decided

425
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,879
to get married as they wish.

426
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,632
Soo-hyun, don't be funny.

427
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,303
So, go to San Francisco.

428
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,305
Go thereâ¦

429
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,225
and be happy.

430
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,189
Hey, hang on a second.

431
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,774
Seriously, why are you doing this?

432
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,984
This is who I am.

433
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,944
A coward with no guts.

434
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,904
You know,

435
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,950
I deluded myself into thinking
that I could change after I met you.

436
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,917
Then tell me the truth.

437
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,795
Did you ever love me?

438
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,096
Answer me.

439
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,099
Tell me.

440
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,270
Say something, anything, Soo-hyun!

441
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,582
I shouldn't have loved you.

442
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,380
I shouldn't have run into

443
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
someone like you from the first place.

444
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,720
Jung Soo-hyun.

445
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,932
From now on, you and I are

446
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,519
complete strangers.

447
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,068
Goodbye.

448
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,345
I didn't mean it.

449
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,182
I'm so sorry.

450
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,328
Over there!

451
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,544
Ian?

452
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,676
I know it must be hard on you,

453
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,220
but you should calm down
and get back to the hall.

454
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,724
Mr. Jung wouldn't have wanted
you to be like this.

455
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,734
Who are you people?

456
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:26,530
We're trauma cleaners
for Mr. Jung Soo-hyun.

457
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,869
Trauma cleaners?

458
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,915
I found the letter
Mr. Jung wrote for his lover.

459
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,586
But it's gone now.

460
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,214
His father burned it.

461
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,944
But not everything is lost.

462
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,714
Mr. Jung planned to go to San Francisco
the day after tomorrow.

463
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,730
It was in there.

464
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,774
I mean Mr. Jung's letter.

465
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:12,178
"Since I met you, for the first time,
I want to live for tomorrow."

466
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:16,307
"I want to be a braver man
than I was yesterday all because of you."

467
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,569
Since I met you, for the first time,
I want to live for tomorrow.

468
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,201
I want to be a braver man
than I was yesterday all because of you.

469
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,547
I don't want to hide anymore
like a coward.

470
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,470
I'll never let go of your hand till I die.

471
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,227
I, Jung Soo-hyun, will take you
as my partner in life

472
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,771
to cherish and love you forever.

473
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,610
I wanted to say this
when I first met you at the hospital.

474
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,072
Sorry it took long.

475
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,783
I love you.

476
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,180
You've completed it.

477
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,267
Why? Is something wrong?

478
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,730
I solved the puzzle,
but I still don't get it.

479
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,025
-About what?
-Mr. Jung was a good man.

480
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,611
Mr. Ian is a nice man.

481
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:24,823
But I don't understand
why his parents were against their love.

482
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,080
I guess they were ashamed
their son didn't have a conventional love.

483
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:36,668
It's a shame when you aren't capable
of loving, not when in love, isn't it?

484
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:41,757
I heard parents are bound to get worried
when their kids are different from others.

485
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:47,221
I believe your dad was
also worried sick about you.

486
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,848
That's not true!

487
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,684
My dad was never ashamed of me.

488
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,937
How would you know?

489
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,482
When kids teased me when I didn't talk,

490
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,945
or when I couldn't go to school
because I talked too much in class,

491
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,280
he always told me not to worry.

492
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,909
He told me
I was just different, not wrong.

493
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,495
That he wasn't ashamed
because I did nothing wrong.

494
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,209
I envy Mr. Ian.

495
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,674
Dad must've had tons of stuff to tell me,

496
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,885
but I never got to hear any of it.

497
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,306
Mr. Ian heard from Mr. Jung
and got the present.

498
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,309
He can now remember him for long.

499
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,437
That's why I envy him.

500
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,830
MURDERER, HUMAN WEAPON

501
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,501
THE LEGENDARY NIGHTMARE

502
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,303
Sang-gu, I have something to tell you.

503
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,847
Yes? What is it?

504
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,351
It's not a big deal,
but I'll fill you in on the details later.

505
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,680
JASEONG NURSING CARE CENTER

506
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,974
SAFETY REGULATIONS
FOR PATIENTS AND GUARDIANS

507
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,172
Get up, you asshole.

508
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,341
Can't you hear me?

509
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,385
Get up now.

510
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,264
How can you fucking sleep
when your enemy stands

511
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,933
right in front of you?

512
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,894
Get up.

513
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,481
Get up,Â and kill your freaking enemy now.

514
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,574
