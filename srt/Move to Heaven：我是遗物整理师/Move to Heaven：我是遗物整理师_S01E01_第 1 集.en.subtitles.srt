1
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,452
Okay.

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,755
Man.

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,935
Oh no!

4
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,146
Wait!

5
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,735
Oh no!

6
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:30,924
MAKING A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT

7
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,759
Whitetip.

8
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,931
Tawny nurse, Flapnose ray, Sandbar,

9
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:43,973
Sand tiger,

10
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,017
Bluestripe snapper.

11
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,771
Manta!

12
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,593
Geu-ru, you're here.

13
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,388
The smallest whitetip's tail is torn.

14
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,182
It's because the biggest sandbar
keeps attacking it.

15
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,186
Seven of the bluestrip snappers are gone
compared to the last week.

16
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,981
The tawny nurse ate one today again.

17
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,900
And Yellow is hurt.

18
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,153
Its left fin is torn,

19
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,239
so it keeps swimming to the right.

20
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,241
It needs to be treated right away.

21
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,577
I'll check if you say so
because you've never been wrong.

22
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,079
Give me a second.

23
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,922
Geu-ru, do you know
you were on fire again?

24
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,427
The aquarists were amazed
at how you noticed those things

25
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,054
when they couldn't at all.

26
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,514
I wonder how and what you can see.

27
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,267
I wish I could explain it to them.

28
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,147
I've been your friend over ten years,
but it still surprises me too.

29
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,108
So I can't imagine how others feel, right?

30
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,196
What I mean is since you're my bestie,

31
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,240
I've become super popular
at the aquarium as well.

32
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,283
Thank you, Geu-ru!

33
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,640
-Bye, Geu-ru.
-Farewell, Na-mu.

34
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,062
I'm home.

35
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,688
-You're home.
-Oh, you're back.

36
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,357
CHICKEN BOWL

37
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,568
Hi, Geu-ru.

38
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,161
MOVE TO HEAVEN
4, HANEULSAN-RO 29-GIL

39
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,385
I'm home.

40
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,386
Come on in.

41
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,179
Let's eat.

42
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,026
CHOCOLATE MILK, YOGURT, DRINKING YOGURT

43
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,820
Okay.

44
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,122
All righty.

45
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,545
No.

46
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,298
Look.

47
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,721
I prefer broken yolk.

48
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,016
Thank you for the food.

49
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,068
How is your egg? Is it good?

50
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,489
I always like an egg you fry, Dad.

51
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,036
Geu-ru, do you want me
to show you how to fry an egg?

52
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,497
But that's what you're good at.

53
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,790
And I'm good at doing the dishes.

54
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,376
You said each one should do
what they are good at.

55
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,339
Wouldn't it be nice if you can do it
when I'm not around?

56
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,092
Why wouldn't you be around?

57
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,053
Are you going somewhere?

58
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,974
It's because I also want
to have an egg you fry at times.

59
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,980
Then I'll learn it right away.

60
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,361
First, open the gas valve
before using the stove.

61
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,614
Then, take out an egg from the fridge.

62
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,998
Hello? This is Move to Heaven.

63
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,048
Sure, I understand.
We'll be there shortly.

64
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,759
Is it a job?

65
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,803
Yes.

66
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,210
Let's see if we are all ready.

67
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,422
Good. Shall we get going?

68
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,139
He got hurt last week
at the factory he worked at

69
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,267
but suffered alone all weekend
without seeing a doctor.

70
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,811
The doctor who came with the police said

71
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,564
because his severe wound
was left untreated,

72
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,818
it caused tetanus or sepsis.
Something of that sort.

73
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,904
What about his family?

74
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,325
His colleague came instead of his parents
and asked me to take care of things.

75
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,328
But take care of what and how?

76
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,456
My boss wants
everything gone and cleaned out.

77
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,457
Gosh.

78
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,877
Since you are an expert at this,

79
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,046
you'll take care of everything, right?

80
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,215
That's correct.

81
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,884
Then we'll get on it
after we check the scene.

82
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,512
Please finish it as soon as possible.

83
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,632
Mr. Kim Seon-u,

84
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,636
you passed away on April 11th, 2020.

85
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,974
We're from Move to Heaven.
I'm Han Jeong-u.

86
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,101
I'm Han Geu-ru.

87
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,022
We'll now begin to help you
with your final move.

88
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,419

Dad.

93
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,051
Are you thinking of the deceased again?

94
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,511
Yes.

95
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,348
What kind of person was Mr. Kim Seon-u?

96
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,433
STAFF: KIM SEON-U

97
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,519
He was a young intern at the factory

98
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,771
who started working
right after high school

99
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,775
and just started
to study to go to college.

100
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,153
His dream was…

101
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,739
GO FOR A PERMANENT JOB!

102
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,617
…to be a permanent employee.

103
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,120
What do you think?

104
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,290
Mr. Kim liked instant cup noodles.

105
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,001
Especially, Jin Ramen, the spicy flavor.

106
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,546
He usually had triangular gimbap
from a convenience store.

107
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,549
He liked all kinds of flavors of gimbap

108
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,136
like pollack roe mayo,
tuna mayo, and Kimchi anchovy.

109
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,513
And he seemed to be sensitive to smells.

110
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,892
He had fabric refreshers
in both his bag and room.

111
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,816
Am I wrong?

112
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,694
No, you are not wrong.

113
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,656
I think he had the cup noodles
not because he liked them,

114
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,659
but because he had no time
to eat properly while working.

115
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,830
And as for gimbap for dinner,
he didn't care for flavors,

116
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,708
but he picked any kind that was on sale.

117
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,212
He had a pair of underwear, nail clippers,

118
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,006
and a fabric refresher in his bag.

119
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,094
It means he was bothered
by the smell of his sweat and dirty nails.

120
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,891
So I assume he was a very neat young man.

121
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,643
There is one more thing.

122
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,647
Mr. Kim Seon-u loved
his parents very much.

123
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,916
You've found
the most important thing, Geu-ru.

124
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,097
UNDERSTANDING OF CYBER COURSES

125
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,008
THE LATE KIM SEON-U, REST IN PEACE

126
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,746
-Are you all done?
-Yes, for now.

127
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,834
The deodorization will be done in 24 hours
since the room is small.

128
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,837
I'm glad you're finished
quicker than I expected.

129
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,882
Do you have the contact information
for Mr. Kim's parents?

130
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,843
We have the number for his work only.

131
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,347
His funeral is held at Sunae Hospital,
so they're probably there.

132
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,933
I see. Thank you.

YEONGSIN DORMITORY

134
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,404
It's a tiny room,
but it was still his home.

135
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,406
Yet, he has so little to throw away.

136
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,783
That's right.

137
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,327
It's grim to see people
who had too much stuff,

138
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,456
but it's also sad to look at
how little someone could leave behind.

139
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,542
I agree.

140
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,045
Well, you guys are all done, right?

141
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,549
We're stopping by his funeral
before we go home.

142
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,385
You found things that bother you,
didn't you?

143
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,265
I feel bad
since he was so young to die.

144
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,018
Although it's cleaning up stuff
left by the deceased,

145
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,354
it's the same
as cleaning up a moving house.

146
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,357
But you care about
the deceased like no one does.

147
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,029
That's why your work is
always my first priority over others.

148
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,908
I'm always grateful.

149
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,368
Okay, I'd better be going.

150
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,661
Sure, thank you.

151
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,925
Wait.

152
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,677

156

157
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,280
19:16 January 10th. Pollack roe,
buy-one-get-one-free. 1,000 won.

158
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,271
We should go see Mr. Kim's parents now.

159
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,273
Right, we should.

JOSEON TECH INCORPORATED
LIM YEONG-GEUN

161
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,467
Seon-u's parents,
you need to listen carefully.

162
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,678
Ma'am, this is

163
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
not a workplace accident.

164
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,307
No workplace accident.

165
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,725
WORKPLACE ACCIDENT

166
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,895
A workplace accident is
being injured at work.

167
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,565
But for Seon-u's case, he was at his dorm.

168
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,526
I mean he died while sleeping in his room.

169
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,029
And he even skipped work without notice.

170
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,573
UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE

171
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,367
So the company holds no liability.

172

LIABILITY

173
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,330
Nevertheless, we want
to take moral responsibility.

174
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,541
You know what that means, right?

175
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,211
This is a token of our condolences.
Understood?

176
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,839
Man, we feel really bad
about what happened.

177
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,800
Everyone loved Seon-u.

178
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,261
What a tragedy.

179
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,391
So, ma'am and sir, don't lose heart. Okay?

180
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:15,685
Hang in there.

181
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,854
Let's go.

182
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,295
I'm sorry for your loss.

183
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:47,092
We cleaned and collected
what Mr. Kim Seon-u left at his dorm.

184
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,804
We're here to give something to you.

185
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,182
His belongings!

186
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,686
They brought what Seon-u had
from his room.

187
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,898
Thank you.

188
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,409
JOSEON TECH, 5 PERSONS

189
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,163
Machine 13 is down.
It needs to be fixed by tonight.

190
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,499
Who will do it? Newbie?

191
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,376
Do I work alone?

192
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,005
Everyone is busy with their situation.

193
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,715
Don't be fussy. You can do it.

194
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,968
Yes, sir. I'll get right on it.

195
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,188
Sir, can I take sick leave tomorrow?

196
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,483
Sick leave? Suddenly? What's wrong?

197
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,529
I hurt my leg while working.

198
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,240
Then go see a doctor now.

199
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,034
You must come to work no matter what.

200
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,996
Clinics nearby are all closed.
Let me see a doctor in the morning.

201
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,625
Don't say a thing
like you got hurt while working.

202
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,962
You can get sacked
for mentioning a workplace accident.

203
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,175
I understand.

204
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,219
I will be at work on time.

205
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,233
-Reporters better stay quiet.
-Yes, sir.

206
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,445
What is this mess?
Why do I have to be here anyway?

207
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,031
I mean, it's heartbreaking.

208
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,660
Good grief. It could've been worse.

209
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,497
It's good
that Seon-u's parents are hillbillies

210
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,207
and can't do this.

211
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,584
If they could,

212
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,087
they would've blown this up
and gotten many of us sacked.

213
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,505
Let's go if you're done.

214
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,009
Parents are bound to wail
over their child's death,

215
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,636
so a quiet funeral like this is very rare.

216
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,722
We should be grateful

217
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,808
that they're like this, okay?

218
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,393
Have a drink.

219
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,105
What's wrong?

220
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,650
Well, Geu-ru.

221
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,320
Wait outside, will you?

222
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:54,946
Sure.

223
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,078
Say that again.

224
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,415
You're grateful that they can't speak?

225
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,502
Damn, who the heck is he?

226
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,546
What?

227
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,883
Hey, what are you doing?

228
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,259
-What the-- Hey!
-Sir!

229
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,803
-If you want to talk, let go of me!
-Sir!

230
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,305
Ma'am.

231
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,183
These people are

232
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,103
the ones Seon-u worked with.

233
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,440
If you have anything you want to say,

234
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,984
say it now. It's okay.

235
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,530
"I told Seon-u

236
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,909
when the economy is as bad as today,

237
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,372
he should be thankful
for the job and the paycheck.

238
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,832
That he should work hard."

239
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,462
"He couldn't go to college
like his friends

240
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:57,342
because we didn't have money,
but since you gave him the job,

241
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,428
I told him to give his best at work."

242
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,225
So answer me.

243
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:13,358
Did my son ever slack off
or do his job half-heartedly?

244
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:20,073
Did he ever say no to your orders

245
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,953
and try to back out from doing his job?

246
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:30,875
Would you have done this
if he were one of your own?

247
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,175
Mom.

248
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,183
WAKE UP AT 6 A.M.!
MUST ENTER THE OPEN UNIVERSITY!

249
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,147
MUST GET SCHOLARSHIP
WHEN ENTERING THE UNIVERSITY

250
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,246
Take this back.

251
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,584
I wouldn't take a penny for my son's life

252
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,129
even if I had to die without it.

253
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,054
I'll be back when the IV infusion is done.

254
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Thank you.

255
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,134
What are you doing?
Why are you following me?

256
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,053
Well, actually--

257
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,429
If you come closer,

258
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,139
I'll call security.

259
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,100
There's something I want.

260
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,977
From me?

261
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,562
Yes.

262
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,439
I really want to have it.

263
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,233
What do you want?

264
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,571
Oh no.

265
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,824
What are you looking at?

266
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,909
That thing.

267
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,327
I want to have that.

268
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,545
Rajidae, Rajiformes,
Chondrichthyes, Chordata, Animalia.

269
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,797
-We're in the lounge.
-Its mouth protrudes.

270
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,341
Its length is three times
of space between eyes.

271
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,136
On the back of the body disc,
on the midline, around the eyes--

272
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,137
Geu-ru!

273
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,516
-Uh? Dad!
-Are you okay?

274
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,892
It's okay. Dad is here.

275
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,106
I'm sorry he startled you.

276
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,153
It's okay.

277
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,240
I wasn't going to take it from her.

278
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,369
I just wanted to ask where she got it.
But she said it's not purchasable.

279
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,080
Do you want it that badly?

280
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,748
Yes.

281
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,208
Why do you want it so much?

282
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,669
I want to give it
to Mr. Kim Seon-u as a gift.

283
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,797
Son!

284
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,386
I know you hate this,
but let me hug you just once.

285
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,432
-No way!
-Don't be like that. Just this once.

286
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,144
You said we shouldn't force things
on someone we love.

287
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,188
Why did I say all those right things?

288
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,149
But let me hug you this once.

289
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,901
Don't be so cheap.

290
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,780
I don't like a hug,
but I won't make you pay.

291
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,199
I'm not cheap.

292
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,423
I want chocolate milk.

293
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,761
That's the definition of being cheap.

294
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,473
We have to go
to give Mr. Kim Seon-u a gift.

295
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,600
-Come on, just a little longer.
-Dad.

296
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,518
Please stop now.

297
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,242
BANKBOOK, KIM SEON-U

298
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,564
Mom and Dad, I'm making money now.

299
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,111
Every day, I'm grateful I'm able to work.

300
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,491
I'll pay for your knee surgery, Mom.

301
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,787
I'll take care of Dad's cataract.

302
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,749
PRECIOUS CHILD

303
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,710
I'm studying for college entrance.

304
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,007
You can live in comfort
once I got a permanent job.

305
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,849
I'm in the neighborhood. I will stop by.

306
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,978
I'd feel better
when things are sorted out.

307
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,605
Okay.

308
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,162
Geu-ru.

309
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,332
I need to go see Mr. Oh, the lawyer.
Come with me.

310
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,335
I'll stay here and watch the fish.

311
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,046
See you later.

312
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,304
-Then I'll make it quick.
-Okay.

313
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,441
Son!

314
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,297
LAWYER OH HYUN-CHANG

315
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,509
The light turned green.

316
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,092
Hey.

317
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,845
-Hey, kid.
-Yes?

318
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,113
DAD

319
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
Dad?

320
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,869
Where are you? Why aren't you back, Dad?

321
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,746
Dad?

322
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,332
Dad?

323
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,209
Why aren't you saying anything?

324
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,628
-My Geu-ru--
-Dad!

325
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,589
I'm…

326
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,177
sorry.

327
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,763
Dad!

328
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,766
Dad!

329
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,145
Dad?

330
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,772
Dad!

331
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,655
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message--

332
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,204
Honeycomb stingray.

333
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,499
Myliobatidae, Rajiformes,
Chondrichthyes, Chordata, Animalia.

334
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,379
The margin is nearly straight.

335
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,298
The space between small eyes is flat.
Its tail is long.

336
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,386
-One, two, three.
-All right. Okay.

337
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,097
A sharp barb on the front that extends--

338
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,519
DRIVER'S LICENSE, HAN GEU-RU

339
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,280
Fasten the seat belt.
Start the car while stepping on the brake.

340
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,948
Shift the gear to D.

341
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,877
The accelerator is like a water balloon.

342
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,047
Gently step on it
in order not to burst it.

343
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,761
Now go search for my dad.

344
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,598
Aren't we there yet?
He's in critical condition!

345
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,312
Learn how to drive, asshole!

346
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,607
Is this a joke? The road is not all yours!

347
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,633
DAD

348
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,855
DAD

349
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,496
I'm not involved in an accident.
I'm not hurt.

350
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,831
Geu-ru.

351
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,376
My dad always comes to pick me up.

352
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,379
But I didn't listen to him today.

353
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,383
He told me not to drive by myself,
but I broke the promise.

354
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,178
That's why he didn't come to pick me up.

355
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,892
It's not like that, Geu-ru.

356
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,811
That's not what happened.

357
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,190
CREMATION

358
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:22,891
Geu-ru.

359
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,811
Geu-ru, you shouldn't do that.

360
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,732
Dad is coming home.

361
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,944
Geu-ru, you aren't supposed to that.

362
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,698
-Dad is coming home with me.
-Geu-ru.

363
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,700
Let him do as he wishes.

364
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,664
Geu-ru, you can take your time
to scatter his ashes.

365
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,252
Be with your dad as long as you want.

366
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,715
Geu-ru!

367
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,349
Son!

368
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,271
Dad

369
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,065
is

370
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,442
always

371
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,236
with you, Geu-ru.

372
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,656
You know that, right?

373
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:54,942
THE LATE HAN JEONG-U

374
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,161

00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,162
Dad is always with Geu-ru.

384
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,646
Who are you?

385
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,357
Who's asking?

386
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,152
Well, I am…

387
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,991
Wait, you're a stranger.
You can't barge in here.

388
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
A stranger?

389
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,786
I'm not a stranger.

390
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,291
Geu-ru, someone is here. Come out quickly.

391
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,209
No beer?

392
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,544
Han Geu-ru!

393
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,024
Hey, who gives you the right to do this?

394
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,526
I do.

395
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,611
Sorry?

396
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,410
Because as of today,

397
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,540
this house belongs to me.

398
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:34,132
