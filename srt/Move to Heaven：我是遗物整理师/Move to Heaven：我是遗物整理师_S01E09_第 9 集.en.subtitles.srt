1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,384
Oh my, look how pretty he is.

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,802
Isn't he?

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,596
There, there.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,723
Sorry.

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,640
Aww.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,559
Are you sleepy? Are you?

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,603
Let's get you changed quickly.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,980
Be careful with his hand.

9
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,566
All done.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,860
-It's chilly, isn't it?
-Put this on quickly.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,905
My name is Kang Seong-min.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:39,372
KANG SEONG-MIN, 29 YEARS OLD
JULY 16TH, 2016

13
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,637
LEFT, RIGHT

14
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,713
Mom.

15
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,352
KARAOKE

16
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,562
Aren't you Korean?

17
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,193
Do you have anyone who can vouch for you?

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,278
PART-TIMER WANTED

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,864
No, I don't.

20
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm sorry, but no.

21
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,253
He should learn to speak Korean
if he came here.

22
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,757
So many losers come into Korea
thinking they can get by speaking English.

23
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,858
CHRISANN MOTEL

24
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,528
Today is the 25th anniversary
of the Sampoong Department Store Collapse.

25
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,949
We swore to make Korea safer then,

26
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,202
but little has been done to this day.

27
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,873
I hope we'll feel less ashamed
a year after today.

28
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,668
I am Kang Eun-jeong,
and thank you for watching SBC News.

29
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,901
-By the way,
-What?

30
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,237
what made you come back?

31
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,572
You said that he's my family.

32
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,785
That the uncle needs to protect
the one and only nephew.

33
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,580
Have you fallen ill or something?
Are you dying?

34
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,498
What?

35
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,541
My mom says when it's time to die,

36
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,794
people tend to change suddenly.

37
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,506
Don't go back to before
whether you're dying or not.

38
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,967
If you make Geu-ru worry again,

39
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,470
I'll tell Mr. Oh on you
and take over the guardianship myself.

40
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,389
That's your intention all along.

41
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,725
Gosh, my intention
has been clear all along.

42
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,020
Let me ask you a question.

43
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,439
How long have you liked Geu-ru?

44
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,567
What? Unbelievable.

45
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
I'm just his friend.

46
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,115
-As his bestie, I'm responsible--
-So when did you start liking him?

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,409
Well,

48
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,661
if you must know,

49
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,663
when I first met him?

50
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,378
When did you say it was?

51
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,214
Maybe around when we were six?

52
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,049
That's when they moved in.

53
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,095
By the way, did anything
seem out of the ordinary?

54
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,430
What do you mean?

55
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,266
Well, Geu-ru is unlike ordinary kids.

56
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,853
Did his parents seem to be struggling

57
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,604
or acting cold to him?

58
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,399
My family was like that.

59
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,694
I've been seriously wondering
even to this day

60
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,237
if my mom is my real mom.

61
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,364
Hey.

62
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,033
Why are you asking me that now?

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,452
Just because.

64
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,748
Geu-ru doesn't really resemble his dad,

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,751
so it got me thinking
if Jeong-u is his real dad.

66
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,213
Right, Geu-ru is really handsome, though.

67
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,343
All thanks to his mom's superior genes.

68
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,804
Actually, now it's time for me

69
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,015
to do a DNA maternity test.

70
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,434
You don't need to.

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,187
You're just like your mom.

72
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,314
What?

73
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,779
Oh, he's just come in.

74
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,741
For me?

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,205
Hello?

76
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,749
Oh yes.

77
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,544
Sure.

78
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,380
Okay.

79
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
All right.

80
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,679
Right.

81
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,474
CHRISANN MOTEL

82
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,644
Thank you for coming so quickly.

83
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,355
No problem.
We didn't have anything else planned.

84
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,357
Because his body was found much later,

85
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,443
the room is quite messy.

86
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,612
May I have

87
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,990
the name and age of the deceased?

88
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,409
His name is Matthew Green.

89
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,785
A male.

90
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,328
He was born in 1988.

91
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,830
Oh.

92
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,415
Was he a foreigner?

93
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,666
No.

94
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,251
He was of Korean origin

95
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,463
but adopted to the US
as soon as he was born.

96
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,716
His Korean name is Kang Seong-min.

97
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,052
But we kept calling him Matthew.

98
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,556
Were you also in charge of him, Ms. Son?

99
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,768
There's this organization which helps
people find their birth parents,

100
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,854
and I'm a volunteer there.

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,522
That's where I met him.

102
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,648
I see.

103
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,401
How did he pass away?

104
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,946
He had a genetic problem

105
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,740
with his heart.

106
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,701
With no one to help him
since he lived alone,

107
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,371
he could do nothing when he collapsed.

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,626
It wasn't my job,
but I wish I'd come by more often.

109
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,877
I'm sorry I didn't.

110
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,290
Shoot.

111
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,509
Oh boy.

112
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,221
Mr. Matthew Green,

113
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:19,058
you passed away on June 29th, 2020.

114
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,434
We are

115
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,437
trauma cleaners from Move to Heaven.

116
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,731
I'm Han Geu-ru,

117
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,568
-I'm Cho Sang-gu.
-That's us.

118
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,860
From now,

119
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,489
we'll begin to help you
with your final move.

120
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,009
KOREAN FOR BEGINNERS
WITH NEWS ANCHOR KANG EUN-JEONG

121
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,184
He must've become her fan
while studying Korean.

122
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,235
This one too?

123
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,964
This as well?

124
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,078
THE LATE MATTHEW GREEN, REST IN PEACE

125
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,137
A-JI

126
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,226
"A-ji."

127
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,227
A-ji.

128
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,188
A-ji.

129
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,065
A-ji!

130
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,900
What? What did you say?

131
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,236
"A-ji."

132
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,864
Mr. Matthew had a dog.

133
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,824
-Really?
-But it's not here.

134
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,659
That's strange.

135
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,165
Here, I got this for you.

136
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,166
Thank you.

137
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,921
We can't find Mr. Matthew's dog.

138
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,757
Is A-ji dead too?

139
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,925
How do you know about A-ji?

140
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,933
Right. He's at the vet now.

141
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
I found A-ji next to Matthew

142
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,022
when I first got to his room.

143
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,775
He'd been whining next to him.

144
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,203
Matthew has been in Korea for four years,
but didn't he have anybody?

145
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,789
No parents or family he found?

146
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,874
He wanted to find them, obviously.

147
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,045
But it's not like you can find them
just because you want to.

148
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,090
Is it possible they can't meet
their family although they find them?

149
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,675
Yes, if their birth parents

150
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,345
refuse to meet
or disclose their information.

151
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,973
Is it what happened to the deceased?

152
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,410
They were adopted,

153
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,538
but how could they end up
being stateless and then deported?

154
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,124
Things have improved now,

155
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,585
but back then
they had few resources to check

156
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:42,047
if those children gained citizenship
of the countries they were adopted to.

157
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,385
So if their adoptive parents
didn't apply for their citizenship

158
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,513
or the adoption is dissolved
as in Matthew's case,

159
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,223
it's impossible to be a citizen.

160
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,349
Dissolve the adoption?

161
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,646
You mean his adoptive parents
gave him up because they didn't like him?

162
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,773
In Matthew's case,

163
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,360
his heart condition was discovered
after he was sent to the US.

164
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,530
So he was sent to many different places…

165
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,535
Matthew's belongings.

166
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,163
We must give them to his mom.

167
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,831
That's the problem.

168
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,542
The center asked her about it

169
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,003
when they told her about his death,

170
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,380
but she said no.

171
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm afraid we can't give this box to her.

172
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
Give me her address, please.

173
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,765
I'll go and give it to her myself.

174
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,974
I don't have it.

175
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,355
And that kind of information
can't be disclosed to anyone.

176
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,358
I'm sorry, I really--

177
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,984
It's not your fault.

178
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,152
Okay.

179
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,946
We will

180
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
take care of it.

181
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,831
Are you serious?

182
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,752
The mother gave up
her own flesh and blood,

183
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,047
and now she refused to see him
knowing he flew all the way here?

184
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,549
How can a mother do that?

185
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,509
Gosh.

186
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,302
People can be very sly.

187
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,346
Well,

188
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,889
what do you mean by that?

189
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,808
To be frank,

190
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,560
till now, I thought I was

191
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,938
the most unfortunate person in the world.

192
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,565
But now I learned

193
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,820
that my life wasn't too bad
compared to the deceased's.

194
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,613
This never occurred to me before.

195
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,615
Mr. Cho,

196
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,243
you have

197
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,454
changed a lot.

198
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,414
Gosh.

199
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
What do you mean?

200
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,167
I've been always like this.

201
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,132
Geu-ru, good job.

202
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,885
SPEEDY AND SAFE WASTE DISPOSAL

203
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,845
Take care.

204
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,304
All righty.

205
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,897
CHRISANN MOTEL
LONG-TERM STAY WELCOME

206
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,984
Let's take off.

207
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,286
WAITING FOR MY DAY TO SOAR

208
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,072
What are you doing up here
at this late hour?

209
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
Geu-ru?

210
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,455
Did you put this whole thing
back together?

211
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,916
Seriously, you're something.

212
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,091
Hey, just forget about it.

213
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,302
It'd be better
not to find that kind of mom.

214
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,261
Still,

215
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,098
I think Mr. Matthew wanted to meet her.

216
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,063
What do you want?

217
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,732
I wanted to see what's up. Is it a crime?

218
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,444
Oh, what is it?

219
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,154
It's a baby garment.

220
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,323
It belongs to the deceased, Mr. Matthew.

221
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,326
It's the tiniest shirt I've ever seen.

222
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,622
It's called baenaejeogori,
a wrap shirt for a newborn.

223
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,082
You also wore one of these.

224
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,628
This is odd.

225
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,756
The deceased still had this, you said?

226
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,384
Usually, moms keep these.

227
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,849
That's why
I want to find his mom to give it.

228
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,226
"To find his mom"?

229
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,606
So this woman

230
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,696
had his son when she was a teenager
and gave him away for overseas adoption?

231
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,575
And she refused to see him
when he came back after 30 years

232
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,327
because she saw him as a burden?

233
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,455
-Yes, I guess so.
-How could she?

234
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,249
What kind of mother would do that?

235
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,252
She might've had no choice as a teenager.

236
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,130
But after all those years,

237
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,632
her son came back, longing to see his mom.

238
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,259
How could she say no to him?

239
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,014
I wonder how we can find his mom.

240
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,725
Shall I post this photo

241
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,310
on the internet sites?

242
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,061
No.

243
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,732
Mr. Matthew missed his mom.

244
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,611
He wouldn't have wanted
to cause any harm to her.

245
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,530
All we need to do is
to deliver his belongings to her.

246
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,489
But still,

247
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,992
I feel really bad for him.

248
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:03,994
What can we do?

249
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,456
We can't go and argue on his behalf.

250
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,307
I found her!

251
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,517
His mom in the picture is right here!

252
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,604
AT MY HOMETOWN HOUSE, 1988
EUN-JEONG AT AGE 16

253
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,861
They look the same.

254
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,529
So this girl

255
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,282
gave birth to him at 16
and sent him away for adoption

256
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,619
and then kept refusing
his request to meet her.

257
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,413
That's Kang Eun-jeong, the anchor?

258
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,000
You found this book
all ripped up in a box?

259
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,336
Unbelievable.

260
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,797
That means Matthew knew
who his birth mom was.

261
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,131
You're right!

262
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,175
Now we can give this box to his mom.

263
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,345
Do you think a woman like her
would bat an eye over this?

264
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,514
She might take it if she sees it herself.

265
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,516
I'm awfully disappointed.

266
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,227
My mom is a big fan of Kang Eun-jeong.

267
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,603
I feel totally betrayed.

268
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,105
If it were up to me,

269
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,649
I'd post this on her network's homepage.

270
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,985
Yeah, do that.

271
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,737
I would like to, but I won't.

272
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,158
Why are you suddenly chickening out?

273
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,712
SBC
KANG EUN-JEONG'S NEWS DAY

274
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,879
-Hi.
-Hi.

275
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,006
How can I help you?

276
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,382
Actually,

277
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,051
we're here to meet Ms. Kang Eun-jeong.

278
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,845
Do you have an appointment?

279
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,971
An appointment?

280
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,056
Well, no.

281
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,058
Then do you know her personally?

282
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,687
No, we don't,
but we have something to give her.

283
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,980
Are you her fan?

284
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,148
Hell, no.

285
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,900
You can leave with us
what you want to give her

286
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,694
with your name and number on here.

287
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,281
It's not something
we can just leave with you,

288
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,908
and we also have things
to say to her in person.

289
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,036
Leave it with us, or leave here.

290
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,830
-Don't make a scene, please.
-Over there!

291
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,749
She's right there!

292
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,376
Oh? That's her.

293
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,253
Ms. Kang Eun-jeong!

294
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,674
Ms. Kang Eun-jeong!

295
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,801
Ms. Kang Eun-jeong!

296
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,928
-Here!
-Stop shouting and move your van.

297
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,388
-Please leave.
-Oh man.

298
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,022
Shoot.

299
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,277
Wow, seriously,

300
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,781
it's freaking hard to meet her
just because she's a celeb.

301
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,907
Gosh.

302
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,784
Where could she be?

303
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,994
Right there!

304
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,499
Uncle!

305
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,027
Ms. Kang Eun-jeong!

306
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,075
Can I help you?

307
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,577
Do you know Matthew Green?

308
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,621
Who?

309
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,456
His Korean name is Kang Seong-min.

310
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,751
He was found in May, 1988

311
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,963
and was adopted to the US
in September the same year.

312
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,634
He was your son

313
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,678
that you gave up.

314
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh my. That's Kang Eun-jeong!

315
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,973
-Sorry?
-Hi.

316
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,688
Let's talk somewhere more quiet.

317
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,026
How do you know this man?

318
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,404
How did you come and find me?

319
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,699
We are trauma cleaners
from Move to Heaven.

320
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,034
We gave the service for Matthew.

321
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,120
Trauma cleaners?

322
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,457
-That means…
-Mr. Matthew Green

323
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,878
passed away on June 29th, 2020.

324
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,632
He died alone from his chronic illness

325
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,426
in his motel room.

326
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,346
His body was found a week after his death.

327
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,352
These are his belongings.

328
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,108
With the help of the center,

329
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,526
he found his mother,

330
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,573
but I heard she refused to meet him
or disclose her information.

331
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,159
I understand that as a celebrity,

332
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,452
it wasn't easy for you

333
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,914
since you had to consider the public eye.

334
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,374
So he didn't get to meet
his biological mother.

335
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,043
What?

336
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,461
Wait.

337
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,839
I'm not talking about
a random person here.

338
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,258
You're the one who refused to see him.

339
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm sorry, but…

340
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,305
I'm not Seong-min's mom.

341
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,558
In 1988,

342
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,185
I was only 16.

343
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,605
That's all the more reason
you needed to keep it a secret.

344
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,482
No.

345
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,525
I'm not his mother.

346
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,984
I have a photo.

347
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,695
The photo of you and him.

348
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,782
I have it right here.

349
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,873
How did he have this picture?

350
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,293
That's him.

351
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,712
My dear Seong-min.

352
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,683
My mother ran a foster home.

353
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,229
My family took care of babies

354
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,773
who would be adopted overseas.

355
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,114
Right?

356
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,038
One, two, three.

357
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,039
Look over here.

358
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,332
Good. Right here.

359
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,460
One, two, three.

360
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,602
SEONG-MIN

361
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:49,983
SEONG-MIN IS LEAVING

362
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,201
Smile.

363
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,578
That's it.

364
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,413
Say Eun-jeong.

365
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,671
Good.

366
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,049
-So cute.
-It's the last day with Seong-min.

367
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,099
It's okay.

368
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,273
We're all done now.

369
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,324
Seong-min was
the last foster baby we looked after.

370
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,206
It became difficult for both my mom and I
to continue on with it.

371
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,710
But because of this photo,

372
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,216
Seong-min thought I was his mom.

373
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,010
He found the same face in the book.

374
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,055
That's how he knew about you.

375
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,019
WAITING FOR MY DAY TO SOAR
BY KANG EUN-JEONG

376
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,273

377
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,623
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
MEET WITH KANG EUN-JEONG

378
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,085
NEWS ANCHOR KANG EUN-JEONG'S ESSAY

379
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,379
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH EVEN TOMORROW

380
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:37,859
Mom.

381
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,239
Why didn't he come to see me?

382
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,576
Had he said his name,
I'd have remembered him.

383
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,204
I would've welcomed him.
Why didn't he come to me?

384
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,498
He did.

385
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,085
Mr. Matthew went to see his mother.

386
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:07,931
Hello.

387
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,685
My name is

388
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,730
Kang Seong-min.

389
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,651
I am Seong-min.

390
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,286
-Hello.
-Hi.

391
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,372
-What's your name?
-Ju Ji-yeong.

392
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,665
-Ms. Ju Ji-yeong?
-Yes.

393
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,709
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Thank you.

394
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,877
I'm your big fan.

395
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,088
-Thank you.
-Sure.

396
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,423
Hello.

397
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,969
-What's your name?
-It's Jang Seo-gyeong.

398
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:46,886
Okay.

399
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,097
Hi.

400
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,518
What's your name?

401
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,231
Well…

402
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,190
You name please?

403
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,485
Seong…

404
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,219
Yes, I can.

405
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,307
MATTHEW, BE HAPPY!
KANG EUN-JEONG

406
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,508
Why didn't he say who he was
when he came to see me?

407
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,596
If he had just blamed me to my face--

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,098
Because he was told

409
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,016
his mom didn't want to see him.

410
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,438
But still, he wanted to see her

411
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,607
because she was his family.

412
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,402
So he took up courage to see you,

413
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,822
but he got scared

414
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,992
to tell you who he was.

415
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,286
"What if she doesn't remember me?"

416
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,707
"What if she finds me disappointing?"

417
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,042
Sang-gu!

418
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,086
He would've wanted you to remember him,

419
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,380
but he got scared

420
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,634
if you'd be disappointed

421
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,137
with who he really was.

422
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,724
And he was also mad at himself

423
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,309
for being the way he was.

424
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,986
SEONG-MIN

425
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,034
He must've been in so much pain
all by himself.

426
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,580
He must've been so devastated and lonely.

427
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
Actually, we apologize

428
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,589
for our ignorance. We misunderstood you.

429
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,717
We are sorry.

430
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,386
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,013
No, it's fine.

432
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,351
Thank you for helping me remember him.

433
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,815
You said you were trauma cleaners, right?

434
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,819
I didn't know this kind of thing
was part of the service.

435
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,114
Your work seems hard yet rewarding.

436
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,657
Thank you so much.

437
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,785
-No problem.
-Sure.

438
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,872
If you don't mind,

439
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,665
can I keep these?

440
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,667
Are you sure?

441
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,753
Will you keep his stuff?

442
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,047
If it's okay with you.

443
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,800
Of course, it's okay.

444
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,927
I appreciate it.

445
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,221
Thank you.

446
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,823
How can a person

447
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
be this miserable even to his death?

448
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,286
Why was he miserable?

449
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,872
He thought he found his mom,

450
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,458
but it turns out she's not the one.

451
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,670
Still, he wasn't miserable at the end.

452
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,047
What?

453
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,133
Mr. Matthew saw his mom,

454
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,553
and Ms. Kang, who he thought his mom,
remembered him

455
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,513
and grieved over his death.

456
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,476
Uncle.

457
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,812
Yes?

458
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,230
We have a place to go.

459
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,377
HEAL ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER

460
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,383
This is a gift for A-ji from Mr. Matthew.

461
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,553
A-JI

462
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,102
There you go.

463
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,690
I'm taking him with me.

464
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,195
I wasn't a good friend to Matthew,

465
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,279
but I will to A-ji.

466
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,853
Look!

467
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,247
Over 65 years, about 200,000 Korean kids
were sent away for overseas adoption.

468
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,125
That's two percent of Seoul's population,
which is nearly ten million,

469
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,629
and it brought dishonor on Korea
as the biggest baby exporter

470
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,755
in the 20th century.

471
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,550
One out of ten children
who were adopted before the year 2000

472
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,386
failed to obtain citizenship

473
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:47,431
and became stateless
because no one cared about them.

474
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,811
As they are not recognized as citizens
by either of the countries,

475
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,021
they struggle to live lonely life.

476
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,607
On the 29th,

477
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:01,404
Matthew Green, an adoptee from the US
who died alone in his motel room in Seoul,

478
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,197
was one of them.

479
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,492
When everyone was enjoying the weekend,

480
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,703
Matthew had to meet lonely death.

481
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,372
To him, his mother country
remained as same

482
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,417
as it was 32 years ago
when he had to fly alone to the US

483
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,295
while people celebrated
the Seoul Olympics.

484
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,340
The government must take action

485
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,511
to help those children in need
who were adopted overseas.

486
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,266
"Matthew" means a gift from God,

487
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,477
but this man couldn't live

488
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,606
as Matthew, an American,
nor Kang Seong-min, a Korean.

489
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,608
GOD'S GIFT, ABANDONED TILL THE END

490
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,694
I express my sincere apology to him

491
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,987
on behalf of Korea.

492
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,951
I'm Kang Eun-jeong,
and thank you for watching SBC news.

493
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,458
Good job, everyone.

494
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,068
I could have been

495
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,155
a Matthew Green, not Han Geu-ru.

496
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,825
What do you mean?

497
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,705
I am just like Mr. Matthew.

498
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,292
I don't know my real mom and dad.

499
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,089
Geu-ru.

500
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,133
But because I met my dad, Jeong-u,

501
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,344
I can be Han Geu-ru now.

502
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,266
My dad loved me very much.

503
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,878
I know you're still caring and worried
about him even in your grave.

504
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,221
MADAM
FINALLY, IT'S TOMORROW! AT 11 P.M.

505
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,567
You still have my documents, right?

506
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,113
I won't fight until I get them back,

507
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,198
so keep them safe.

508
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,702
And this is my last warning.

509
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,621
In case

510
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,708
something happens to me

511
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,084
at the tomorrow's game,

512
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,299
don't you ever set a foot near this house.

513
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,342
You got that?

514
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,220
Make sure you do your part

515
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,806
because I bet everything on you.

516
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,228
Shit.

517
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,253
What?

518
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,224
Uncle.

519
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,935
Good morning.

520
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,936
Have a seat.

521
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,437
Breakfast is ready.

522
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,290
Eat up.

523
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,834
-Uncle, are you dying?
-What?

524
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:29,964
Na-mu said people suddenly change
when they're terminally ill.

525
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,758
Gosh, you don't want my food? Is that it?

526
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,593
Forget it, then. I'll have it all.

527
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,305
Tell me you're not dying, then I will eat.

528
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,768
Your uncle is not dying, kid.

529
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,186
Look how strong I am.

530
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,070
Then thank you for the food.

531
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm not dying!

532
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,663
The yolk is broken.

533
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,209
Oh okay. Let me swap it.

534
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,717
Thank you for the food.

535
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,386
DRINKING YOGURT, CHOCOLATE MILK

536
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,412
Good morning.

537
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,831
Breakfast is ready for you.

538
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,291
Eat it before it gets cold.

539
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,004
What's going on?

540
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,006
Na-mu.

541
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,050
No way.

542
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,885
See? Something is up.

543
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,388
Geu-ru…

544
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,307
Take care of him.

545
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,103
Just keep up what you're doing now,
no more, no less.

546
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,230
Are you going somewhere?

547
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,523
It just

548
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,692
came to my mind. That's all.

549
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,654
Are you running away from home again?

550
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,031
To run away from home,

551
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,616
you need to have home first.

552
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,786
This is home.

553
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,955
This is your home too!

554
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,259
Geu-ru, we have a problem!

555
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,386
I know.

556
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,346
Oh, you do?

557
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,264
Yes.

558
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,100
Uncle prepared breakfast for me

559
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,351
and cleaned the house.

560
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,520
But he's not dying.

561
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,230
Maybe he is.

562
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,818
Your uncle might not come back for good.

563
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,654
He texted me he'd not come back,
but he did.

564
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,781
No, this time

565
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,617
I have a strong feeling he won't.

566
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,953
Didn't you notice anything odd?

567
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,253
"You still have my documents, right?"

568
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,424
"I won't fight until I get them back,

569
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,967
so keep them safe."

570
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,428
"And this is my last warning."

571
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,513
"In case,

572
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,725
something happens to me
at the tomorrow's game,

573
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,437
don't you ever set a foot
near this house."

574
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,521
"You got that?"

575
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,149
This is what Uncle said last night.

576
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,386
How are you doing?

577
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,889
You said you wanted to talk.

578
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,309
My documents.
I want them before I go up to the ring.

579
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,979
-I need to send them to someone.
-I said I'd give them back.

580
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,190
I've never lied to you, have I?

581
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,149
That's true.

582
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,818
But in life, you never know

583
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,778
what might happen.

584
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,321
Who knows?

585
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,325
I might end up like Su-cheol
in a few minutes.

586
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,662
I guess he's taught you a good lesson.

587
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,586
Give it your best.

588
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,798
When I said I bet everything on you,

589
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,675
I wasn't joking.

590
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,075
Yuk.

591
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,037
What?

592
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:54,997
What is it?

593
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,710
PUNCH DRUNK

594
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,088
CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY

595
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,928
Now the moment we've been waiting for.

596
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,932
As we announced,
the biggest match of the year will begin.

597
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,351
A champion from Russia,

598
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,228
Hell Raiser!

599
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,068
And the undefeated legendary fighter

600
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,070
with 88 wins out of 89 matches.

601
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,365
Nightmare!

602
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,666
Geu-ru,

603
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,877
do you know anything about punch drunk?

604
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,254
You mean punch drunk syndrome?

605
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:45,923
Yes. That thing.

606
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,134
It's a neurodegenerative disease

607
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:53,305
commonly seen in boxers and footballers
who experience repeated head injuries.

608
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,142
It can cause conditions
such as aphasia, agnosia and dementia

609
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,936
as well as acute conditions

610
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,647
like anxiety, memory loss
and loss of consciousness.

611
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,024
In severe cases, you can lose your life.

612
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,820
Oh no! Uncle Sang-gu might die
if he fights tonight.

613
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,656
He went fighting knowing all that.

614
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,700
Really? It can't be!

615
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,952
It can't be happening!

616
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,913
I don't want Uncle to get hurt.

617
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,373
I don't want him to die.

618
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,708
He cannot die!

619
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:25,160
