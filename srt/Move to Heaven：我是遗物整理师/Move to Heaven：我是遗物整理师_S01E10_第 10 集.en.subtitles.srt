1
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,601
Go!

2
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,857
Hit him!

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,235
Hit him!

4
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,585
Finish him!

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,680
Hop in now.

6
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,432
Na-mu, are you allowed to drive?

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,809
I got my license last week for this day.

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,395
Get in already.

9
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,700
Let's call the police.

10
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,911
Uncle told me to do so when in trouble.

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,538
Hold on. What if they arrest him too?

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,041
That can't happen.
He shouldn't be arrested!

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,170
That place is full of bad people.
What do we do if something happens?

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,469
Who are you calling?

15
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,012
Hello? This is Han Geu-ru.

16
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,933
You told me to call you
if something bad happens.

17
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,976
Something bad is happening to me now!

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,567
Here!

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,613
Right.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,366
We need the passcode to get in.
What shall we do?

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,243
Darn it.

22
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,746
What?

23
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,582
What are you doing?

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,754
What the…?

25
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,382
How did you know?

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,552
I saw the numbers
when I came to find Uncle.

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,388
What? You came here to find him?
With whom?

28
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,056
With whom did you come here?

29
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,627
He's over there.
No! He's already in a fight.

30
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,887
Hit him!

31
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,930
Uncle!

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,726
Darn it.

33
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,231
Shit.

34
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,026
Turn the darn lights on!

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,035
Over there!

36
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,411
What?

37
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,537
Where are you going?

38
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
Get up already!

39
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,332
Get up!

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,960
Fight back!

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,841
What's going on?

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,302
Turn back the lights on!

43
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,804
What's going on here?

44
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,932
Uncle.

45
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,935
What? What are you doing here?

46
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,186
Let's get out of here.

47
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,313
Hey! What the heck are you doing?

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,734
What the hell are you doing?

49
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,195
-What?
-What is it?

50
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,613
-What is it?
-What?

51
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,031
What is it?

52
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,785
The police!

53
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,370
It's the police!

54
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,542
The police is here!

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,210
Run, everyone!

56
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,548
Now, you are all under arrest
for illegal gambling.

57
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,259
You have the right to have an attorney

58
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,552
to defend yourself.

59
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,971
You also have the right to refuse…

60
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,231
SWAT TEAM

61
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,330
What happened?

62
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,123
How did you find me here?

63
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,541
Punch drunk syndrome.

64
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,876
We know you have it.

65
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,002
"Punch drunk"?

66
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,712
You must go to a hospital.

67
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,088
Your head might explode.

68
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,465
You can't die!

69
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,549
You can't die!

70
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,925
-You can't die!
-Geu-ru!

71
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,385
You got it wrong.

72
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm not dying!

73
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,597
Your uncle is fine,

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,890
so calm down.

75
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,184
I don't believe you.
Let's go to a hospital.

76
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,729
I'm telling you.
I don't have punch drunk syndrome.

77
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,150
Move.

78
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,695
-Okay.
-Don't push me.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,032
The place was so well hidden
that we were fooled every time.

80
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,617
How did you find out?

81
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,869
I have an informant.

82
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,120
-An informant?
-Come on!

83
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,456
Who is it?

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,833
Well, that's…

85
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,587
confidential.

86
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,010
What the fuck?

87
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,387
Come on!

88
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
What's this?

89
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,806
Get in!

90
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,987
MOVE TO HEAVEN

91
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,377
No.

92
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,129
Don't.

93
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,088
Don't!

94
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:08,970
Don't!

95
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,805
No!

96
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,074
Oh shit!

97
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,534
What the…?

98
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,161
What are you doing here?

99
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,037
I'm here

100
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,415
to check if you are still alive.

101
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,332
Hey.

102
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,294
I told you.

103
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,837
I'm fine.

104
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,298
Even the doctor said last night

105
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,425
I'll be fine if I'm careful from now on.

106
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm in the hospital
because you guys insisted,

107
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,222
but they say I'm good to go even now.

108
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,058
Is it true?

109
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,935
Yes, it's true.

110
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,523
Dad kept the truth of his illness from me.

111
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,652
That's because

112
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,780
your dad loved you so much

113
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,367
that he didn't want you to be worried.

114
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,328
I don't love you that much.

115
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,538
So I'm not hiding anything.

116
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,373
Then it's all good.

117
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,541
That's wonderful.

118
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,127
Don't love me, Uncle.

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,505
Don't hide any truth from me.

120
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,302
Sleepy?

121
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,013
See? You should've stayed home.

122
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,306
Why bothered to come?

123
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,684
Can I sleep here?

124
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,521
Sure, why not?

125
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,703
Shoot.

126
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,188
The Seoul Metropolitan Police
and Nambu Prosecutors' Office

127
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,067
announced that on the night of the 9th,
the authorities rounded up a group

128
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,320
running a gambling den
where unauthorized fights were conducted

129
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,905
with billions of won at stake.

130
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,242
Here's the investigation report
of the Public Prosecutors' Office.

131
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,869
Around midnight on the 9th,

132
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,456
the Seoul Metropolitan Police
and the Nambu Prosecutors' office

133
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,377
received a tip-off of a big gambling den
where fights were being conducted

134
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,546
with billions at stake.

135
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,882
We mobilized immediately and arrested

136
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,595
most of the individuals related
to the crime--

137
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,933
-Uncle, breakfast is ready.
-For me?

138
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,520
You prepared for me too?

139
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,733
I can sit there?

140
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,260
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

141
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,367
Mr. Oh, what brings you here this early?

142
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,161
I'm here to talk to Geu-ru.

143
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,957
Geu-ru,

144
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,711
how long will you keep
your dad's ashes here?

145
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,381
The memorial park told me
they've been calling you

146
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,758
about his natural burial
which is ready now.

147
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,678
They say that you've been avoiding
their calls and texts.

148
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,724
I know how heartbroken you are,
but it's time to let him go.

149
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,604
Let him rest beside your mom
before it's too late.

150
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,615
Hey.

151
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,890
Geu-ru.

152
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,937
Gosh.

153
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,525
Geu-ru!

154
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,862
You've been there for hours!
Please come out.

155
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,533
Geu-ru,
are you going to stay there forever?

156
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,787
Geu-ru, aren't you hungry?
Don't you need to go to the bathroom?

157
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,081
He's so stubborn.

158
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,417
He hasn't had water for over 12 hours.

159
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,127
Goodness.

160
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,796
Oh, no! Is he dehydrated?

161
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,757
What if he fainted?

162
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,091
What?

163
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,261
Geu-ru!

164
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,264
Answer me!

165
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,434
Shoot. That's it. Move aside.

166
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,690
Geu-ru!

167
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,281
Is he only invisible to me?

168
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,867
Look.

169
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,124
What?

170
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,751
This crazy punk!

171
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,420
Next door, where did he go?

172
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,421
How would I know?

173
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,881
I can't believe this kid.

174
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,842
Hold on. First off,

175
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,220
we need to figure out where he might be.

176
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,682
Geu-ru!

177
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,518
Han Geu-ru!

178
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,148
Geu-ru!

179
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,485
Han Geu-ru!

180
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,987
Han Geu-ru!

181
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,199
Geu-ru!

182
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,952
Han Geu-ru!

183
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,079
-How did it go?
-Not good.

184
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,581
-Where on earth did he go?
-Goodness.

185
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,874
Han Geu-ru!

186
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,543
Geu-ru!

187
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,837
Shit.

188
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,052
It's driving me nuts.

189
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,683
Han Geu-ru!

190
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,393
Han Geu-ru!

191
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,353
Gosh.

192
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,563
Where did he go?

193
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,524
Goodness.

194
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,867
Han Jeong-u,

195
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,369
your son is missing.

196
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,454
I want to find him, but

197
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,874
I don't know anything

198
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,459
about your son.

199
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,338
I have no clue what to do now.

200
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,552
Don't just stand there and smile.
Say something!

201
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,430
Darn it.

202
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,765
What the heck am I doing?

203
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,894
Darn.

204
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,005
The test results show no abnormalities
in his hearing or vocal organs.

205
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,510
Then why doesn't he speak?

206
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,387
In this case,

207
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,556
we can assume it stems from
his unusual psychological state.

208
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,810
He doesn't want to speak for some reason.

209
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,521
We call this selective mutism.

210
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,649
Then what can we do?

211
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,901
We have to wait for now.

212
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,862
Let's find another way
to communicate with him.

213
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,784
Your facial expressions and body gestures
are very important.

214
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,702
"Thank you."

215
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,037
"Thank you."

216
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,664
"Thank you."

217
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,165
"I appreciate it."

218
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,793
RED SKATE, WHITE-SPOTTED EAGLE RAY

219
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,256
What about "I'm sorry"?

220
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,926
Jeong-u, how do we say,
"It's dangerous. Don't touch it"?

221
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,053
I can't remember. One moment.

222
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,431
"I'm sorry"…

223
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,437
When we say "I'm sorry"…

224
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,356
Jeong-u, you need to see this.

225
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,359
What?

226
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,487
Geu-ru.

227
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,615
Can you show your dad how to say,

228
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,036
"It's dangerous. Don't touch it"?

229
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,546
Okay. One more time.

230
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,256
"I'm sorry."

231
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,595
It's our first time here, Geu-ru.

232
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,933
Look at the group of fish coming this way.

233
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,770
Wow, look over there!

234
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,855
There are so many.

235
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,485
-He likes it here.
-Right.

236
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,913
Geu-ru.

237
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,583
Do you like it here?

238
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,836
The fish are fantastic, aren't they?

239
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,182
Butterfly ray.

240
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,684
Butterfly ray

241
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:28,148
belongs to Gymnuridae, Rajiformes,
Chondrichthyes, Chordata, Animalia.

242
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,733
It is one meter long.

243
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,653
Its large and flat body disc is overall

244
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,906
in a diamond shape
with its body and head joined together

245
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,075
with the pectoral fins.

246
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,370
-The front tip is pointed…
-Geu-ru is finally…

247
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,663
…in a soft S-shape.

248
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,125
-It's wider than its length.
-Thank you, Lord. Thank you so much.

249
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,904
BUSAN FIREFIGHTING SERVICE

250
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,185
BEST FIREFIGHTER KIM JUN-SIK
BUSAN FIRE DEPARTMENT, 2011

251
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,190
SENIOR FIREFIGHTER HAN JEONG-U, 2000

252
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,487
AWARDED FIREFIGHTER OF THE MONTH
BUSAN FIRE DEPARTMENT, APRIL 2000

253
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,994
Are you the one asking about Han Jeong-u?

254
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,379
Yes, the kid's name is Han Geu-ru, right?

255
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,548
You still remember him.

256
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,799
How old is he now?

257
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,842
He's 20.

258
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,221
That means 20 years have passed already.

259
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599
Do you know about Geu-ru?

260
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,434
Is he…

261
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,978
Do you want to know how Jeong-u met him?

262
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,272
Yes.

263
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,943
Everyone with him that day says
they can never forget what happened.

264
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,987
It snowed here that day.

265
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,116
As you know, we rarely have snow here
even in the middle of winter.

266
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,536
It was a really clear day,

267
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,498
but suddenly something like dust
was falling from the sky.

268
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,333
It was snow.

269
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,463
Hey, guys, come out! It's snowing now!

270
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,717
Can't you see it's snowing?

271
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,011
Wow.

272
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,434
-It's snowing a lot!
-This is awesome.

273
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
-It's my first snow here.
-Really?

274
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,647
-Yes, since I came here.
-Really?

275
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,023
He's a country bumpkin.

276
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,817
Snow in Busan? Unbelievable.

277
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,111
119 FIRE DEPARTMENT

278
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,822
Gosh, let's go.

279
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,785
They think a cat is trapped
in the water tank in Seongmun-dong.

280
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,580
Someone made a complaint
about losing sleep because of its noise.

281
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,374
It's a cat again.

282
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,545
It crawled into the tank to get warm,
then it got trapped there.

283
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,382
Are we the 911 rescue team,
or animal rescuers?

284
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,386
We are cat rescuers for sure.

285
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,096
Be ready.

286
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,856
911 RESCUE

287
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,859
Hello.

288
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,861
This way?

289
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,448
Where is the cat?

290
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,242
Where are you going?

291
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,368
Is it here?

292
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,828
-Here's the cage.
-Okay.

293
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,082
A cat's meow sounds like a baby's crying.

294
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,500
It gives me the creeps.

295
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
Darn it.

296
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,879
What are you waiting for?

297
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,339
Get the equipment now.

298
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,674
-Yes, sir.
-It's snowing. Move your lazy ass.

299
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,343
-Hurry!
-Jun-sik!

300
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
What?

301
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,430
Listen.

302
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,057
Listen carefully.

303
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,559
Oh no.

304
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,853
I hear nothing now. Is it dead?

305
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,273
-Hold it. One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

306
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,632
Kitty.

307
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,509
Kitty, where are you?

308
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,101
Kitty!

309
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,395
Kitty.

310
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,539
Call the ambulance now!

311
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,873
We got a baby down here!

312
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,042
It's not a cat. It's a human baby!

313
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,168
It's a baby!

314
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,296
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

315
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,719
Hurry.

316
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,180
How can this be?

317
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,726
Go now.

318
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,667
NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

319
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,835
Excuse me.

320
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,922
What happened to the baby
rescued from the water tank today?

321
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,758
Are you the firefighter who rescued him?

322
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,095
Yes. How is he?

323
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,140
Not good.

324
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,811
He was in a place like that
in this weather.

325
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,313
He's way too young for that.

326
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,358
It's too early to lose hope.

327
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,403
It's a miracle he managed to survive

328
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,280
in that condition.

329
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,041
RESTRICTED AREA, NO CELL PHONES

330
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,003
Would you like to see him?

331
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,214
Can I?

332
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,726
Live.

333
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,437
You can make it.

334
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,941
Fight back.

335
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,086
Jeong-u.

336
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,130
The baby from the tank.

337
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:31,923
Yes, what about him?

338
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,759
I heard he made a recovery.
Something's wrong?

339
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,845
No, he'll be sent to an agency.

340
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,974
We should report on the situation
at the time he was found.

341
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,393
I wrote up everything.
You can just sign it.

342
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,564
Which agency?

343
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,233
The ward office said since he's a baby,

344
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:53,653
he might be adopted overseas
or something like that.

345
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,583
What's up?

346
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,171
Do you remember that baby

347
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,256
I rescued from the water tank?

348
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,215
Yes.

349
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,092
Is he not doing good?

350
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,053
No, he's all recovered.

351
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,263
He'll be sent to an agency.

352
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,849
And he might be

353
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,769
sent away for overseas adoption.

354
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,648
Babies are still sent away like that
even now.

355
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,858
I guess so.

356
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,866
-Jeong-u.
-Yes?

357
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,951
I want to see that baby.

358
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,121
Really?

359
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,665
Yes.

360
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,440
Hey.

361
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,236
-Wow.
-Goodness.

362
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,195
That's right.

363
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
Look how gentle he is.

364
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,368
Right?

365
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,704
He has a stronger grip now.

366
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,581
This is amazing.

367
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,583
Wow.

368
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,710
You're eating well.

369
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,211
Is it good?

370
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,935
There, there.

371
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,065
It's all right. What's that?

372
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,156
Hey.

373
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,587
Hey. There, there.

374
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,338
Goodness.

375
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,884
It's okay. It's all right.

376
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:26,806
Jeong-u!

377
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,683
What should we do?

378
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,018
What is it? What's wrong?

379
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,478
The baby

380
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,896
will be adopted soon.

381
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,898
Jeong-u.

382
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,066
I can't let him go.

383
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,444
I don't think I can.

384
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,280
-What do I do now?
-What do you think?

385
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,367
If you can't let him go,

386
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,660
we don't have to.

387
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,537
Are you sure?

388
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,833
I was going to bring it up if you didn't.

389
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,502
I already have a name for him.

390
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,503
Jeong-u!

391
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,967
Wait,

392
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,594
you named the baby?

393
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,429
Without discussing it with me?

394
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,848
What did you name him?

395
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,099
Geu-ru.

396
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,184
Han Geu-ru!

397
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,940
Why? You don't like it?

398
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:17,982
No.

399
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,734
I love it.

400
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,278
Han Geu-ru.

401
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,239
Our son's name.

402
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,115
What a wonderful name.

403
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,251
Couples tend to resemble each other,
but they were more than that.

404
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,171
They were so alike
as if they were one person split into two.

405
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,217
Look over there.

406
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,593
Okay, here.

407
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,720
One, two, three!

408
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,722
Geu-ru was so adorable

409
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,391
and became our mascot here.

410
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,433
Good job.

411
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,815
Why did Jeong-u quit the job here
and moved to Seoul?

412
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,194
They were so happy,
but with the good comes with bad,

413
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,362
his wife became ill.

414
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,324
She was always weak. Maybe that's why.

415
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,910
As soon as she was diagnosed
with terminal cancer,

416
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,288
she refused the treatment
to spend time with her son.

417
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,542
Jeong-u quit the job right away,

418
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,254
and his family spent every moment together
till she was gone.

419
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
Mom is crying.

420
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,986
Mom is sick.

421
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,864
No.

422
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,575
These are happy tears.

423
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,412
What is "happy"?

424
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,623
It's like you feel really good.

425
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,834
It makes you smile.

426
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,256
Being happy makes
water come out of your eyes.

427
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,719
I am happy

428
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,971
whenever I see you.

429
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,516
Water comes out of your eyes
whenever you see me.

430
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,986
Geu-ru.

431
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,615
Thank you

432
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,620
for letting me live as your mom.

433
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,165
Thank you so much.

434
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,294
A lot of "happy" is coming out now.

435
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,004
LEARNING THE KOREAN ALPHABET

436
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,856
You need to stop.
Mom isn't here anymore.

437
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,399
Mom is here!

438
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,483
Mom is here!

439
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,027
Mom is here!

440
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,787
Mom is here!

441
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,706
Mom is here!

442
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,749
Mom is here!

443
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,417
Mom is here!

444
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,085
Mom is here!

445
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,837
Mom is here!

446
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,797
Mom is here!

447
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,674
Mom is here!

448
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:33,780
BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY CITY BUSAN

449
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,865
Oh, maybe he went there.

450
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,369
-Sorry?
-If he came here,

451
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,914
he had only one place to go.

452
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,208
Where is it?

453
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,779
Geu-ru, let's go see mom.

454
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,412
Mom is not here.

455
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,958
Mom is here.

456
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,502
Where?

457
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,176
Right here

458
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,928
and here.

459
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,180
And

460
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,099
right here too.

461
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,940
Geu-ru.

462
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,192
Close your eyes.

463
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,449
Do you remember
we came here often with Mom?

464
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,452
I can see mom.

465
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,705
Mom, Dad, and I

466
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,498
are all here.

467
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,642
No.

468
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,521
I don't like it.

469
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,816
Please come back.

470
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,735
Come back quickly.

471
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,861
Come now.

472
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,114
Come now.

473
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,199
No!

474
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,117
I don't like it!

475
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,743
No!

476
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,078
-Geu-ru.
-I don't like it!

477
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,456
-Geu-ru!
-No, please come back!

478
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,666
Geu-ru.

479
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,126
Geu-ru!

480
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,172
Dad is gone.

481
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,799
I can't see him anymore.

482
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,052
Yes.

483
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,097
I miss my dad.

484
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,142
But I can't see him anymore.

485
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,854
No matter how hard I try,

486
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,857
Dad doesn't give me a prize,
"Excellent job."

487
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,110
I can't hear his voice anymore too.

488
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,572
Really?

489
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,741
I don't think that's true.

490
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,704
Someone I know told me

491
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,708
that even the deceased

492
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,377
can speak.

493
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:45,925
MOVE TO HEAVEN

494
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,094
Mr. Han Jeong-u,

495
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,681
on April 13th, 2020,

496
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,976
you passed away.

497
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,314
I'm Han Geu-ru, a trauma cleaner

498
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,775
from Move to Heaven.

499
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:05,945
Now,

500
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,114
I will begin

501
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,243
to help you with your final move.

502
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,626
EXCELLENT JOB, COMPLIMENTS FOR HAN GEU-RU

503
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,087
NAME: HAN GEU-RU, EXCELLENT JOB

AWARD
SENIOR FIREFIGHTER HAN JEONG-U

505
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,420
HAPPY FIRST BIRTHDAY, GEU-RU

506
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,645
FRIDAY, APRIL 20TH, 2001

507
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,065
GEU-RU, HAN GEU-RU,
MONDAY, APRIL 30TH, 2001

508
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,590
MOVE TO HEAVEN

509
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,934
GALLERY

510
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,098
That was awkward. Again.

511
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,476
Son.

512
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,687
Geu-ru.

513
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,732
When it's time to say goodbye,

514
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,275
people cannot lie.

515
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,946
Do you remember
what your mom's last word is?

516
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,324
Thank you

517
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,995
for letting me live as your mom.

518
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,624
Thank you so much.

519
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,001
If someone asked me

520
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,129
what my happiest memories in life were,

521
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,174
I'd answer they were living as your dad.

522
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,762
You are sad
because you can't see me, aren't you?

523
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,891
But Geu-ru,

524
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,894
you can't ever forget what you see.

525
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,813
Memories about Mom and Dad are

526
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,191
all saved in your eyes.
So I'm sure you will be fine, right?

527
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,739
Okay, lastly,
you have to promise me one thing.

528
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,536
Remember what I told you everyday?

529
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,997
From now on,

530
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,916
you will be telling that

531
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,086
to yourself in the mirror everyday
in my place.

532
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,003
What did I say?

533
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,714
"Excellent job."

534
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,133
That's right.

535
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,634
Yes, excellent job, my son.

536
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:25,347
-Who's the coolest person in the world?
-Han Jeong-u's son, Han Geu-ru.

537
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:15,314
THE LATE HAN JEONG-U, REST IN PEACE

538
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,318
THE LATE HAN JEONG-U, 1977-2020
THE LATE MIN JI-WON,1977-2006

539
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,817
That's right.

540
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,959
Talking with people

541
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:18,961
is difficult.

542
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,755
I can't understand

543
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,090
what's on people's minds.

544
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,010
When you want to get
their feelings and thoughts,

545
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,013
you can imagine yourself
being in their shoes.

546
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,392
I can't do that because I'm not them.

547
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,352
It's easy. Just imagine.

548
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,522
"How sad would I be if I were that sick?"

549
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,400
"How mad would I be
if someone lied to me?"

550
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,445
"How happy would I be
if someone said nice things to me?"

551
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:46,989
Like that.

552
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,454
Don't get nervous.

553
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,625
Just let it know
you don't hate it or aren't intimidated.

554
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,303
See?

555
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,512
Nothing happens.

556
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,275
No.

557
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,373
-Oh no, Geu-ru!
-Na-mu.

558
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,392
HAN JEONG-U

559
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,150
What did I always say to you?

560
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,861
Although you can't see someone…

561
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,781
"It doesn't mean they're not with me."

562
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,449
As long as you remember…

563
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,994
"They are not gone."

564
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,496
That's right.

565
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,740
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes?

566
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,660
You've done a great job.

567
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,538
Oh, no problem.

568
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,543
Today is the last day
of those three months we promised.

569
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,381
As the supervisor
of Geu-ru's guardianship,

570
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,133
for three months,

571
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,302
I've closely watched
how you got along with him,

572
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,680
and I've made a decision
whether it's okay

573
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,474
for you to maintain your guardianship.

574
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,186
I have decided

575
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,064
that you're disqualified

576
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,650
to be Geu-ru's guardian.

577
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,695
There are many reasons,

578
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,823
but the biggest one is
the illegal gambling incident.

579
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:38,160
Your involvement
in that group's illegal acts

580
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,579
put Geu-ru in danger.

581
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,249
Would you like to elaborate on anything?

582
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,044
No, I wouldn't.

583
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,088
Then you don't object
if I demand to terminate

584
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,591
your guardianship contract
with Gue-ru, do you?

585
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,053
No, I don't.

586
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:02,059
Then what's going to happen to him?

587
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,061
Are you worried about him?

588
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,401
No.

589
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,736
I'm not worried at all.

590
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,698
That kid has you

591
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,493
and Next door, so I'm not worried.

592
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,794
I feel much relieved now.

593
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,963
I never thought
of being a guardian or protector before,

594
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,548
so this job was such a hassle.

595
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,636
So I would've said no

596
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,263
even if you asked me to keep doing it.

597
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:42,974
It's good news.

598
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,728
I guess this is it.

599
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,814
I should get going.

600
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:50,857
Thank you.

601
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,904
Where are you going?

602
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,158
We are not done yet.

603
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,162
That was purely my opinion.

604
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,748
Geu-ru has expressed that

605
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,043
he'd like to continue to have you
as his guardian.

606
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,629
Sorry?

607
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,383
The ward's opinion
is the most important factor

608
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,927
when it comes
to the guardianship contract.

609
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,429
Therefore, you, Mr. Cho,

610
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,432
are still and will continue to be

611
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,685
Geu-ru's guardian.

612
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,272
Any objections?

613
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,488
Goodness.

614
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,914
-Do you hear what you're saying?
-Stop throwing stuff!

615
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,541
Stop what?

616
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,460
Say it again! What did you just say?

617
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,007
Keep asking me won't change my answer.

618
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,968
I will no longer hide from you,
and I'll say it out loud.

619
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,181
I'm officially going to work with Geu-ru
at Move to Heaven!

620
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,224
Are you out of your mind?

621
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,059
Stop right there!

622
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,728
I can't believe her!

623
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,771
Why did I give birth to that brat?

624
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,315
Gosh, she's driving me crazy!

625
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,443
I've always known this day would come.

626
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,360
What?

627
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:23,074
From the day Geu-ru and his dad
came by to say hi when they moved in.

628
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,578
From the moment I heard
the boy of Na-mu's age

629
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,288
was named Han Geu-ru.

630
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,498
So what about it?

631
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,752
Na-mu, a tree, Han Geu-ru, one tree!
Even their names are meant to be.

632
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,838
We'll have to give in.

633
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,550
There's no way
parents can change their child's destiny.

634
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,636
Destiny, my foot!

635
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,347
I will get her name changed right away!

636
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,225
Na-mu? Han Geu-ru? That's ridiculous!

637
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,035
Excuse me.

638
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,500
Is this Move to Heaven,
a trauma cleaning company

639
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,960
for dead people?

640
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:17,087
-Yes.
-Hi.

641
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,880
Nice to meet you.

642
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,800
How can I help you?

643
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,136
I came here to make a request

644
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,721
for trauma cleaning.

645
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,599
When did the deceased pass away?

646
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,478
She hasn't passed away yet.

647
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,523
But she's going to soon.

648
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,567
Okay.

649
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,568
Then,

650
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,905
give me the name and address
of the deceased-to-be

651
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,534
with the name and number
of the one who requests.

652
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,371
The name of the deceased-to-be
is Cha Eun-byeol.

653
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,541
Her address is 358-4, Yeonhwa-dong, Seoul.

654
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,295
And the one who requests the service is

655
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,337
also Cha Eun-byeol.

656
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,173
That's odd.

657
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,467
What is odd?

658
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:09,347
The deceased-to-be and the client
has the same name.

659
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,599
It's not odd at all.

660
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,980
Because I'm going to die soon,

661
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,441
I'm requesting the service for myself.

662
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:11,608
