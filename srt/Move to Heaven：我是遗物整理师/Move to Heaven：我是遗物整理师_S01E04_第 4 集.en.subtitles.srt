1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,134
Before you sign the statement,
let's go over everything again.

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,181
First, you went to Lee Seon-yeong's
at 20:00 on the night of the incident.

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,184
How many more times
does he have to repeat himself?

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,813
It's okay.

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,737
Around 8:00 p.m.,

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,241
I went to her apartment to talk with her.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,326
I wanted to talk it out

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,455
and change her mind.

9
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,959
I thought she pushed me away

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,920
-because the idea of marriage scared her.
-Thanks.

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:50,175
The moment I saw her,
I knew she was the one I'd marry,

12
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,926
so I hurried on with our wedding.

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,097
I felt like I scared her
by moving too fast.

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,310
So, I was planning to tell her
we can take things slow.

15
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,024
You have to stop this!

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,777
-Stop!
-Seon-yeong.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,570
Calm down, and hear me out.

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,115
I'll kill myself.

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,953
I'll kill you!

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,663
Drop the knife, and let's talk.

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,999
Seon-yeong, drop the knife!

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,774
Is this 911?

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,653
My girlfriend is injured.

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,406
Please come quickly!

25
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,829
-Quickly!
-Out of the way!

26
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,996
Officer Oh, hold him!

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,998
Step back. Wait here.

28
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:05,959
Please calm down.

29
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,836
Step back.

30
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,613
Uncle, draw the curtains.
Na-mu, close the door.

31
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,699
The curtains? Okay.

32
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,325
Okay.

33
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,555
What is it now?

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,520
When we deal with a crime scene,
we must remove all the bloodstains.

35
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,025
After the primary cleaning, we must remove
the wallpaper and floor paper.

36
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,695
Thinking that the murder took place here

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
gives me the creeps.

38
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,283
Why?

39
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,786
Because it's horrible.

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,415
The culprit's been arrested by the police.

41
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,336
The body has been taken for an autopsy,
so there's nothing scary or creepy.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,963
You don't need to be creeped out, Na-mu.

43
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,012
They are finally cleaning Unit 201 now.

44
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,639
They should've done it sooner!

45
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,141
Think of others in the building.

46
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,144
The housing prices dropped
because she was killed here.

47
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,062
Shush.

48
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,522
The police had been here before.

49
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,775
How did she end up like that? Ugh.

50
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,985
He seemed to be a polite and friendly man.

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,987
I wonder why she did that.

52
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,450
Sir.

53
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,454
Are you a corpse cleaner?

54
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,623
-What?
-My mom said

55
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,959
you'd spread germs if I talked to you.

56
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,835
Jun-su, come here now!

57
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,671
-Hae-sol, come here.
-Now!

58
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,672
Come here!

59
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,633
Boo!

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,804
Shit.

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,557
A corpse cleaner?

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,519
Darn, unbelievable.

63
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,310
LEE SEON-YEONG, NEULCHAN KINDERGARTEN

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,520
FOR EUN-MI'S BABY, DUE ON MAY 26TH

65
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,526
THE BIGGEST GIRL IN THE WORLD,
ANGELICA

66
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,866
STRONG AND TOUGH BEETLE

67
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,120
I LOVE YOU, MS. LEE.

68
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,837
EDUARDO,
THE BIGGEST TROUBLEMAKER IN THE WORLD

69
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,243
USER'S GUIDE

70
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,346
THE LATE LEE SEON-YEONG
REST IN PEACE

71
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,435
Feeling tired?

72
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,230
Excuse me.

73
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:42,276
I represent the committee of this complex.
You'll be done today, right?

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,196
Well, we can't say that for sure.

75
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,031
You must by today.

76
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,950
And about your van.

77
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,245
Can you move it to somewhere else,
so no one can see it?

78
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,538
Please do that now.

79
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,126
The residents are
really stressed out over this.

80
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,254
It's bad for kids' education too.
Do it quickly and leave.

81
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,505
Please. Okay?

82
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,300
And you aren't allowed to smoke here.

83
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,056
How is this bad for kids' education?

84
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,853
People don't like it
when death occurs in their surroundings.

85
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,107
Dad and I have been
often asked to move our van too.

86
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,860
Not to bother other residents,

87
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,946
we have to work with doors
and windows closed even in summer.

88
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,533
So how much more work do we have?

89
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,703
We clean it out today,
and we'll be back to sanitize tomorrow.

90
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,079
Oh boy.

91
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey.

92
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,711
Did you put them aside
to give someone again?

93
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,088
We'll go to Ms. Lee's kindergarten.

94
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
Gosh, count me out.

95
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,094
Instead, I'll wrap it up here for you.

96
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,389
Ugh, I'd rather be treated
as a criminal by those ladies

97
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,352
than deliver the deceased's stuff
to people who don't want it.

98
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,520
Okay? What the fuck?

99
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,479
You bitch!

100
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,192
You'd never get away
unless you die, bitch!

101
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,279
-Then kill me now.
-What? You shut your mouth!

102
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,325
You bitch!

103
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,743
Don't move.

104
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,412
Like a bitch, like a son.
You fuckers never listen!

105
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,831
I'll get my way!

106
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,586
Come here. I said, come back here!

107
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,213
Come here!

108
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,507
You need more beating!

109
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,468
Just kill me now! Just kill me!

110
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,886
Kill you?

111
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,597
I'll never let you get your way.

112
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,533
NEULCHAN KINDERGARTEN

113
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,617
I'm sorry,

114
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,536
but we can't take these.

115
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,248
Sorry? Why not?

116
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,085
Her students believe
Ms. Lee just went on a trip.

117
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,923
I can't give these saying
they're gifts from their dead teacher.

118
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:51,966
It'd be awkward.

119
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
Why is giving a gift awkward?

120
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:56,929
Sorry?

121
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,684
Ms. Lee wanted to give these books
to her students as a gift.

122
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,480
For Min-su, the sleepyhead.

123
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,773
MR. TARDY, JOHN

124
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,067
For Seong-min,
who hates brushing his teeth.

125
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,194
For Jun-su, the troublemaker.

126
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,904
For Ji-min, the shy one.

127
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,449
For Seo-jin, who loves insects.

128
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,535
For Mi-rim, who thinks she's fat.

129
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,872
She handpicked them for each student.

130
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,874
I understand, but--

131
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,208
Then how about this?

132
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,337
Without telling them
they're from Ms. Lee,

133
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,797
maybe you can have them read it.

134
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,717
What a waste they would be.

135
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,762
Okay.

136
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,181
Okay, I can do that.

137
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:42,975
Thank you.

138
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,561
Thank you.

139
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,106
Wow, how fun!

140
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,066
Wow!

141
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,447
I'm glad she's taken the books.

142
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,662
What's wrong?

143
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,205
ROSE CLASS, KIM EUN-MI

144
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,666
We need to meet
Ms. Kim Eun-mi of Rose Class.

145
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,384
What's this?

146
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,511
It's a gift from Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

147
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,388
Sorry?

148
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,143
FOR EUN-MI'S BABY, DUE ON MAY 26TH

149
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,374
It's my fault.

150
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,211
If she weren't my friend,

151
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,589
she'd still be alive now.

152
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,390
Those two met at my wedding.

153
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,058
Watch the steps.

154
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,519
-Bye, Ms. Lee.
-He was a guest for my husband.

155
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,063
He fell in love with Seon-yeong
at first sight

156
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,232
and pursued her, but it was one-sided.

157
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,785
At first, she just put up with him.

158
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,833
Later, she had no choice but to seek help.

159
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
But no one believed her.

160
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,345
When I suspected something's wrong,

161
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,139
things already got dangerous.

162
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,897
That's why
she quit her job and tried to leave.

163
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,525
But that jerk found out
and went to see her.

164
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,239
Self-defense?

165
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,116
That's all lie.

166
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,619
I told the police about it.

167
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,582
Seon-yeong would rather die
than point a knife at someone.

168
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,297
Poor Seon-yeong. I am so sorry for her.

169
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,676
I feel so guilty.

170
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:04,802
USER'S GUIDE

171
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,890
It wasn't there.

172
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,101
It wasn't there.

173
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,854
It wasn't there!

174
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,484
Hey, I'm trying to get some sleep here.

175
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,987
Okay? What are you doing?

176
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,781
There was no dog.
Maybe a cat? No cat either.

177
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,533
What are you talking about?

178
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,659
There was no pet.

179
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,911
There was no pet at Ms. Lee's place.

180
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
Gosh.

181
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,082
What kind of random nonsense is this?

182
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,334
Ms. Lee didn't have a pet.

183
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,545
That's why we must go to her place now.

184
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,547
Go where now?

185
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,631
To Ms. Lee's place.

186
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,427
In the middle of the night?
It's far from here!

187
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,095
Hey, kid!

188
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,431
Darn it.

189
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:57,855
You said you didn't know
Ms. Lee quit her job at the kindergarten.

190
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,816
That's right.

191
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,070
So you went to her place to talk.

192
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,281
What happened after that?

193
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,560
Darn it.

194
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,105
Hey, kid, see?

195
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,151
There's nothing in here.
What is it that you're looking for?

196
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,988
Petkit Mate. Color, white. Weight, 599 g.

197
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,658
Size, 9 cm in width, 12 cm in length.

198
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,536
Audio system, two mics and two speakers.
A camera in full HD, 1080p.

199
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,622
Wireless transmission
with a 2.4GHz band.

200
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,416
-Hey--
-It can capture, save, and share a moment.

201
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,627
You can take a photo or video

202
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,797
and easily share
the special moment with friends.

203
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,258
It rotates 360 degrees.

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,303
The unique rotating bottom allows you

205
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,264
to check every corner of your house
without a blind spot.

206
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,937
She said she'd go on a trip.

207
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,276
I asked her where and for how long
out of concern.

208
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,238
She told me to back off,
and the fight began.

209
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,827
I said I'd tell her parents about it
if they didn't know.

210
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,414
She got worked up and started screaming.

211
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,625
Then, she got the knife from the kitchen.

212
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,214
She threatened to kill me and herself

213
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,012
if I told her parents that.
Then she started to swing it at me.

214
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,979
I was afraid
she might hurt herself with that knife,

215
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,945
so I had to take it from her.
We wrestled over it quite a bit.

216
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,534
Then I fell with her in my arms.

217
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,709
A wide angle of 110 degrees.

218
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,253
A camera with a wide-angle lens
of 110 degrees

219
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,797
enables you
to monitor every hidden corner.

220
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,882
Wait, a camera?

221
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,967
Is it what you're looking for?

222
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,386
I don't think there's one in here.

223
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,222
Full HD videos of two million pixels.

224
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:42,019
The 1920-by-1080 HD resolution enables
you to monitor without missing a spot.

225
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,313
What?

226
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,659
When I came to my senses and got up,

227
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,829
I saw too much blood.

228
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,583
At first, I thought it was mine.

229
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,085
But it was Ms. Lee's.

230
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,264
Hey! Move aside.

231
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,390
I'll have a look.

232
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,518
Gosh.

233
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,854
I'm telling you. There's no camera here.

234
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,405
Geu-ru.

235
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,323
Yes?

236
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,617
You need to call

237
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,121
your cop friend now.

238
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,966
So I immediately called 911 on my phone

239
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,594
-until they came--
-He gave her first aid.

240
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,181
Don't you have
the specifics of his indictment?

241
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,560
He's such an honest suspect,
which is rare to see.

242
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,605
Let's sign the paper.

243
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,825
Hang on a second.

244
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,161
Mr. Kim Yong-u,

245
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,789
let me check with you one last time.

246
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,005
I swear…

247
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,343
I really loved Seon-yeong.

248
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,432
This bastard is pure evil.

249
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,412
Seon-yeong, this will be the last time.

250
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,497
Let me say one last thing before I go.

251
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,917
I swear it won't take five minutes.

252
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,377
You can call the police
if it takes longer.

253
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,796
Don't do this to me.

254
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,299
I'll keep banging on your door
until you open it.

255
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,178
Do you want neighbors
to call the police like the last time?

256
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,198
What do you want?

257
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,494
What are you--

258
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,178
I told you.

259
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,640
There are only two ways

260
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,434
that you can leave me.

261
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,188
It's either I leave you,

262
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,358
or you have to die.

263
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,694
Is this 911?

264
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,529
Please come quickly.

265
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,911
Out of the way! Now!

266
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,079
Officer Oh, hurry!

267
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,206
Gauze!

268
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,167
Calm down.

269
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,253
Mr. Kim Yong-u.

270
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,299
You'll be indicted
for the murder of Lee Seon-yeong.

271
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,385
SUSPECT'S STATEMENT
APRIL 2020

272
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,772
Geu-ru, say hello to the prosecutor
in charge of Ms. Lee's case.

273
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:02,237
I didn't expect to see such a young man
when I heard he was a trauma cleaner.

274
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,614
I'm Han Geu-ru, 20 years old.

275
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,658
Well, first off,

276
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,161
can you please tell me

277
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,456
how you could find this critical evidence
when my team couldn't?

278
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,835
The second box in the small room
had manuals for electronic devices.

279
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,049
TV, washing machine, air conditioner,
laptop, air purifier, air fryer, and--

280
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,550
A camera, right?

281
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,762
There was the user's guide, but no camera.

282
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:31,767
A Petkit camera is for monitoring pets,
but Ms. Lee didn't have any pets.

283
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,602
So I found it odd.

284
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,604
I can't sleep when things are odd.

285
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,984
Thank you.

286
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,280
Because you found it odd,
the truth could come out.

287
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,491
Because you couldn't sleep,

288
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,451
Ms. Lee could finally rest in peace.

289
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,994
Thank you.

290
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,171
Excuse me.

291
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,508
Wait.

292
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,427
Do you have something else to say?

293
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,263
That man.

294
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,476
I have something to show to the man
who did that to Ms. Lee.

295
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,269
What is it?

296
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,173
WE LOVE YOU, MS. LEE SEON-YEONG

297
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:52,722
I love you the second-best
to my mom in the world.

298
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:59,354
Ms. Lee Seon-yeong of Azalea Class
is the prettiest in the whole wide world.

299
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,942
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry I ran away
when I had to brush my teeth.

300
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,362
Ms. Lee, I promise
I will eat carrots from now.

301
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,281
Please don't go.

302
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,784
I want to marry you
when I grow up, Ms. Lee.

303
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,953
Wait just 20 years.

304
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,597
From Azalea Class
of Neulchan Kindergarten,

305
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,726
Min-su, Ji-min, Seo-jin,
Seong-min, Jun-su, and Mi-rim

306
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,478
loved Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

307
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,481
But you, Mr. Kim Yong-u,

308
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,400
did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

309
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,778
You did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

310
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,645
You did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

311
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,982
You did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

312
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,569
You did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

313
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,323
You did not love Ms. Lee Seon-yeong.

314
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,539
I have a question.

315
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,584
Is this how you always handle
the deceased's belongings?

316
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,629
I don't understand what you mean by that.

317
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:52,926
Well, it seems like the deceased
only tell you important stories.

318
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,261
Oh!

319
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,389
How did you know?

320
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,226
My dad said the deceased tell their story

321
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,437
when looking at their belongings closely.

322
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,148
I see.

323
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,901
However,
without our willingness to listen,

324
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,153
my dad said we couldn't hear it clearly.

325
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,617
Take it. It's my business card.

326
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,120
Do you see the number here?

327
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,288
LEE JU-YEONG

328
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,624
Should anything happen to you
or to Move to Heaven,

329
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,626
don't hesitate to call me anytime.

330
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,128
I don't need it.

331
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,716
-Why not?
-Because I memorize it all.

332
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,885
Lee Ju-yeong, Division 4,
Seoul Nambu Prosecutor's Office.

333
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,096
390 Geonju-ro, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul.

334
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,889
Zip code, 08899.

335
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,602
Phone number, 02-3129-4200.

336
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,730
Fax number, 02-3129-4255.

337
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,172
How will you pay this week's interest?
It's five million won.

338
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,717
If you can't make it,
a fight at tomorrow's game will do.

339
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:33,360
BOMHAE REAL ESTATE OFFICE

340
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,376
A real estate office?

341
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,636
Hello.

342
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,975
-The man who has just left is my uncle.
-Okay.

343
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,189
He thinks he gave you the wrong address,
so he wants me to check with you.

344
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,232
Okay.

345
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,068
He said it was 4, Haneulsan-ro 29-gil.

346
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,404
4, HANEULSAN-RO 29-GIL

347
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,947
Did I get it wrong?

348
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,867
No, that's the correct one.

349
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:28,123
He wanted to sell it quickly
so that he could get the deposit soon.

350
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,293
But tell him since it's not an apartment,
it'd take time.

351
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,587
But I'll try to get him the best deal.

352
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,967
Okay, I'll tell him that.

353
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,210
What's this?

354
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,004
It's a baby monitor.

355
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,882
It's for a mom
to hear a baby crying, right?

356
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,759
Correct.

357
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,927
My mom and dad used it when I was a baby.

358
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,472
I tested with my dad before.

359
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,016
I could hear him
even from the storage room.

360
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,434
It's like a walkie-talkie.

361
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,896
Whoa, this is really cool.

362
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,973
All righty.

363
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,549
-Please let me go.
-Get in, damn it.

364
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,093
-Please--
-Darn it.

365
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,761
-Get in.
-I won't do it anymore.

366
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,138
-Just fucking get in.
-I'm begging you.

367
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,473
-Please.
-Get in.

368
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,475
-Please just this once.
-Damn, get in.

369
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,102
Please this once.

370
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,728
-I'm sorry!
-Fuck!

371
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,784
Dad, you're going to kill Mom! Please!

372
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,496
-Who do you think you are?
-Stop it!

373
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:18,001
-Mom, go. Just run away!
-What the fuck? Get off me, punk!

374
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,462
Don't hurt them. They can't fight back.
Kill me instead!

375
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,797
Are you fucking crazy?

376
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,884
Face the fucking wall!

377
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,011
What a fucking nutjob.

378
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,053
You little punk.

379
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,314
You little--

380
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,696
Who are you?

381
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,031
Me?

382
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,158
A passerby.

383
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,410
Then mind your own business, and pass by.

384
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,329
I'd really love to do that,

385
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,457
but there's no other way,
but here to get to my house.

386
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:03,129
And you're literally getting in my way
when I do my daily exercise.

387
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,133
So what?

388
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,054
If you promise me
you won't lay a hand on her,

389
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,556
I'll reconsider.

390
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,187
See? Happy?

391
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,648
Now,

392
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,775
let's each go our own way.

393
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,871
-You liked that, bitch?
-Right.

394
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,749
Come to think of it,

395
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,544
I just remembered one thing.

396
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:48,841
A bastard like you
never gets out of this shitty habit.

397
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,931
Shit.

398
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,978
You little--

399
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,611
Fuck!

400
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
No!

401
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,693
Geu-ru.

402
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,529
Where's your uncle?

403
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,865
He's in the shower.

404
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:02,707
Tell me, is everything all right
when you're alone with him?

405
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,876
What do you mean by that?

406
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,210
For example,

407
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,629
does he yell at you

408
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,339
or try to hit you?

409
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,424
Uncle does

410
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,967
yell a lot.

411
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,220
And he often practices
hitting other people.

412
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,348
His exercise appears to be scary,

413
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,975
but he never hits me.

414
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay, then.

415
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,486
However, if anything happens
when you're alone with him,

416
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,446
make sure you scream near that tent.

417
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,616
-Understand?
-Not really.

418
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,536
If something happens, we should call 911.

419
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,664
They won't come
even if I scream near the tent.

420
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,041
I'll come running.

421
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,584
I'll be swifter than they.

422
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,502
Okay?

423
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,596
-What?
-You are hurt.

424
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,931
Your wrist is bleeding.

425
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,974
It is nothing.

426
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,768
I tripped during my exercise.

427
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,853
I didn't realize I got hurt.

428
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,440
-You must see a doctor if you're hurt.
-No one sees a doctor for this.

429
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,525
Forget it.

430
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,068
Then let's apply ointment.

431
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,706
Uncle, you could pass away
unless you got it treated.

432
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,084
What?

433
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,046
Mr. Kim Seon-u
whom I cleaned up after with my dad

434
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,133
passed away as he left his wound
from work untreated in time.

435
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,137
It caused his parents to cry a lot.

436
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,980
I have no parents to cry over that shit,

437
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,150
so it doesn't matter.

438
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,695
Gosh.

439
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,290
I understand. I'm coming now.

440
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,616
Shoot.

441
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,662
Hey!

442
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,958
Please follow that taxi.

443
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,252
Is he your boyfriend?

444
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,129
Is he cheating on you?

445
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,548
Yes, so please hurry.

446
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,948
Darn.

447
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,870
No.

448
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,227
Shoot.

449
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,704
Shoot. Darn it.

450
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,416
Shoot.

451
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,209
-In here?
-There's such a place?

452
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,295
-In here?
-How can it be?

453
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,506
There's a secret passage
no one knows about.

454
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,510
Voila!

455
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,304
What the--

456
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,972
There really is!

457
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,184
Wow, this looks fun! Where is it?

458
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,977
It's awesome!

459
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,645
What is this place?

460
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,073
Really?

461
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,699
-I can't believe it.
-Awesome!

462
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,117
It looks fun.

463
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,580
-Now it starts.
-How much did you bet?

464
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,540
Darn, I bet a lot on him.

465
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,923
And now!
The moment you've been waiting for.

466
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,966
The highlight of the night.

467
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,678
Crush, the rising star
versus the prodigal fighter,

468
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,641
Nightmare!

469
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,228
We will begin this big match shortly.

470
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,189
If you haven't made your bet yet,
you should hurry.

471
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,858
-Ten, nine, eight,
-Nine, eight,

472
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,652
-seven, six,
-seven, six,

473
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,487
-five, four,
-five, four,

474
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,240
-three, two, one!
-three, two, one!

475
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,705
Whom did you bet on this time?

476
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,166
-Nightmare.
-Nightmare?

477
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,585
He seems like an old geezer.

478
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,754
He's a so-called human murder weapon.

479
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,672
For real?

480
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,217
He sent an opponent to the other side
with one punch.

481
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,885
He's the legend I've heard of?

482
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,139
He came back after serving time.

483
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,271
Nice!

484
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,148
That's it!

485
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,151
The legend, my foot!
He's only being beaten up!

486
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,444
He might have a plan.

487
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,446
He's a freaking psycho once he snaps.

488
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,366
He'll show what he can do
when the stakes go up.

489
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,786
That's it!

490
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,079
The legend, my ass!

491
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,998
Nice! Destroy him!

492
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,749
How much did you bet?

493
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,711
I'm going to rake in some dough.

494
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,589
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

495
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,715
Is he for real?

496
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,023
Geu-ru, what shall we do?
They say your uncle is a murderer!

497
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:45,242
