Yumi's Cells 2

2
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,070
Episode 39: Laptop

3
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,540
First place* is mine! Mine!
(First to leave a comment.)

4
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh yeah! First place! First place!

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,580
Its unique sweetness disappeared. It's boring!

6
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,810
Writer Kim Yumi, are you going through a hard time? This is like a funeral march dragging on.

7
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,410
Why did you make a sequel? Just end it if you don't have anything to say.

8
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,950
I can't read this anymore. I'm leaving now.

9
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,440
What?

10
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,650
Oh yeah! First place!
Its unique sweetness has disappeared.

11
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,960
The top comments are all malicious comments.

12
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,160
It's because it's so popular. There are no malicious comments if it's not popular.

13
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,640
But still, there are too many malicious comments these days.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,850
It's because the ending is almost near. They must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't worry too much about it, Writer. You're going to give them a great ending.

16
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,540
A great ending?

17
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,510
Our company's employees are all looking forward to it, too.

18
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,990
Since you're not giving them any hints, they're all in suspense wondering what the ending will be.

19
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,830
What will the ending be? I'm curious about that, too! Can't you let me know what the ending will be?!

20
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,050
Cook cell told me to bring this to you so you can gain some strength.

21
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,780
Bye!

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,620
A great ending!
Goddess Yumi! Let's make the best ending!!

23
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,720
Although you get the full support of everyone once you become the top priority, it's not necessarily a good thing.

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,900
Oh, no. What should she do?

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,350
She has to end it well.

26
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,240
What should she do if it doesn't go well?

27
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,900
- What if she gets cursed at more?
- Stop it!

28
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,850
They said they're looking forward to a great ending.

29
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,070
If it's not a great ending, won't Yumi be ostracized?

30
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,420
I said stop it, please!

31
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,850
The cell that is always attached to the top priority is Anxiety.

32
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,330
If this doesn't go well, it's over! We used all of the down payment to buy the house.

33
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,130
We took out a huge loan!

34
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,930
If things go badly, how will we pay back the loan?

35
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,080
What will we do? What will we do? What will we do? What will we do?!

36
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,890
I said stop it!

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,620
I'm so anxious that I can't write!

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,130
You will send the manuscript tomorrow morning before coming to the wedding, right?

39
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,990
I will have to.

40
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,540
Miss Writer, fighting! I'll see you at the ceremonial hall.

41
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, fighting!

42
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,650
Although Yumi was under a lot of stress ahead of the release of the sequel,

43
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,900
the real incident occurred the night before Yi Da's wedding.

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,590
Reason! Emergency, emergency!

45
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,990
- What is it?
- I don't see the laptop!

46
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,180
Carefully look for it. It must be somewhere.

47
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,430
It's not there!

48
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,090
It's not in the place where she usually charges it?

49
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,980
It's not there!

50
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,700
Then what about the dining table?

51
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,330
What about under the bed?

52
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,590
It's not there!

53
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,310
Did she use a different bag?

54
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,020
No!

55
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,630
Did it get mixed in with the recyclables?

56
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm telling you it didn't!

57
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,220
It's not here. It's gone.

58
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,700
How much of the manuscript is in the laptop?

59
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,060
Including the episode that I'm going to upload tomorrow, there are sixty pages for six chapters.

60
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,650
That much? You didn't make a backup?

61
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm sure she left it somewhere when she went out.

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,470
What places did she visit today?

63
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,420
It's because the ending is almost near. They must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.

64
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,260
There! She had the laptop up until then.

65
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes, Miss Writer?

66
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,270
- Your laptop?
- Yes.

67
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,750
We were looking at my laptop together this morning and talking about the comments.

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,660
That was my laptop, though.

69
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,250
You didn't take your laptop out.

70
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,290
Did you lose it? What are you going to do?

71
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,490
Yes, well...

72
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,510
I have to find it. I'll probably find it.

73
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,520
You backed it up, right? As long as the manuscript is all right ...

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, of course!

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,820
Goodbye.

76
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
She must have really lost it.

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,340
Let's not despair!

78
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,770
For now, she can just go buy a new laptop tomorrow and rewrite it all!

79
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,580
Rewrite it all? 60 pages?!

80
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,300
Don't you have the outline all in your head?

81
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,890
In the end, Yumi couldn't find the laptop up to the morning of the wedding.

82
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,280
What will she do now? Everyone from the publishing company is going to the wedding.

83
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,220
What will she do? Come up with an excuse somehow!

84
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,210
There's no manuscript to upload today,

85
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,060
and there's no manuscript to upload next week either. Even if she writes, there are malicious comments.

86
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,690
What do we do? They won't leave—

87
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,760
I don't want to be the prime cell.

88
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,210
Take care.

89
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,420
Don't look for me ever again!

90
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,850
Bye!

91
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,890
Writer!

92
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,830
Writer abandoned her prime cell position and ran away.

93
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,620
Thank you. Thank you.

94
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,490
Thank you.

95
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,050
Aigoo, Writer Yumi! You made it.

96
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,060
Editor-in-Chief. Congratulations.

97
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,950
Thank you.

98
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,020
- Where's Yi Da?
- She's in the waiting room right now.

99
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,990
You finished by the deadline before you came, right?

100
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,730
- Yes.
- I'll read it after the ceremony.

101
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,450
I'm looking forward to the last chapter.

102
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,540
Yes.

103
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, yes. Excuse me.

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,490
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

105
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,260
The groom's side

106
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,670
Kim Yumi

107
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,700
Wow, Miss Yumi!

108
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,930
Oh, Bon Hui! Hello!

109
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,820
- It's been a long time. It's been so long!
- I know!

110
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,890
It's good to see you.

111
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,530
Wait, I heard that you're the one who set up the bride and groom.

112
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,200
They said that the groom is your editor-in-chief.

113
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,210
I didn't set them up.

114
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,740
Your order is ready.

115
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,360
Really? He was a loser this time, too?

116
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,450
Yeah. He was the worst of the worst.

117
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm not trying to find who is the worst!

118
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,790
- I was really angry and—
- Miss Writer.

119
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,490
Oh, Editor-in-Chief?

120
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,450
I saw you on my way to the publishing company.

121
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,720
Oh, I had plans with my friend here.

122
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,670
I was actually going to leave soon.

123
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,350
Yi Da, say hello. This is my Editor-in-Chief. I've talked about him a lot, right?

124
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,360
This is my former co-worker, Yi Da.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,210
Hello, I'm Kang Yi Da.

126
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,580
Hello. I'm Ahn Dae Yong.

127
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,590
- You're the best!
- Pardon?

128
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,460
You're the one who chose Yumi's story.

129
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,100
I always told Yumi that you've got a great eye..

130
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,320
You've really got a great eye for writers.

131
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Well, that's because her writing is—

132
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,420
You're the best! Really the best!

133
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,420
What is this? Who is that cute creature?

134
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,000
She said she's Kang Yi Da.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,660
Let's save that. Kang Yi Da.
[Kang Yi Da]

136
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
Her name is Kang Yi Da.

137
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,380
Cute Best (Jjang) Yi Da.

138
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,040
The rhyme is perfect, too!

139
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,060
- Hello!
- Hello.

140
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,580
Hello, I'm Ahn Dae Yong who greeted you last time. You remember me, right?

141
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,150
Oh, this ajeossi?

142
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,200
Yes, of course. Hello, how have you been?

143
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,010
I have a meeting nearby today.

144
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,460
If it's all right with you, would you like to have lunch together?

145
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,510
Julie Literature Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong

146
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,280
Yes, that sounds good.

147
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,670
What's with this ajeossi? It doesn't suit him to leave an emoticon.

148
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,420
He's cute.

149
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,870
I only introduced them to each other. I found out later that they were dating without me knowing.

150
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,530
What's with that? Oh, you also set Ruby up with her boyfriend.

151
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,630
I also only introduced Ruby to him, and they started dating on their own.

152
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,190
Then I should stick by you from now on if I want to get married.

153
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,310
Oh right! We're catching up and forgot we haven't even given our congratulatory money yet. Just a moment!

154
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm in charge of giving them the envelopes from the marketing team.

155
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,490
Yu Ba Bi

156
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,860
Team Leader Yu couldn't come, so he put me in charge of it.

157
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,090
I see.

158
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,550
Do you know that he's going to an overseas branch?

159
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,140
- An overseas branch?
- Yes, he was assigned to Singapore.

160
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,100
He said he couldn't come because he's leaving today. So he asked me to bring the envelopes.

161
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,610
What's this? This is ridiculous.

162
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,150
Writer cell ran away, and Love isn't here.

163
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,330
Are there cell villages that don't have a prime cell?

164
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,150
- Reason.
- Huh?

165
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,080
Is our Yumi really doing well right now?

166
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,090
She broke off the wedding, and she failed to meet the deadline.

167
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,920
Hey, you can't be like that. Today is Yi Da's wedding. Let's not ruin the mood.

168
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,890
I'm saying that I'm sad. Everyone else gets married so easily.

169
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,520
- Is there anything else?
- No, that's everything.

170
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,600
I just left. I'll call you when I get to the airport.

171
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,190
All right.

172
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,960
Hello?

173
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,340
- Hello, this is the café at the Baekseok-dong intersection.
 - Oh, yes.

174
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,390
Hello.

175
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm calling the number that was left on the coupon.

176
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
I see. What is this about?

177
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,690
She's a writer. I thought she would be looking for it.

178
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,900
Yes, that's right. She would be looking for it.

179
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,730
I'm glad that I had your phone number.

180
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,410
Yes, thank you.

181
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,680
She's probably at the wedding right now.

182
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,010
Should we head to the airport now?

183
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,780
Oh, yes.

184
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,660
No! One moment. I've got to stop somewhere.

185
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,990
This is my first request.

186
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,320
More than anything else, please be considerate of each other.

187
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Passionately taking in each other's charms and strengths

188
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,360
will make you happy ...

189
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,140
Are they going to give us steak?

190
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,850
- Or galbitang?
- Be quiet.

191
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,230
I want to eat steak.

192
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,790
- Oppa.
- Hm?

193
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,120
By the way, isn't that woman in the pink dress pretty? The one on the bride's side?

194
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,070
- You're way prettier, Ruby.
- What are you saying? That's obvious.

195
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,880
Did I say something too obvious?

196
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,100
Next, ...

197
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,340
a married couple always ...

198
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,280
Let's listen attentively to the good message.

199
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,360
- Yes, sir.
 - When the husband loves his wife

200
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,140
and when the wife loves her husband, only then can a true family be established.

201
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,080
All right, everyone. Listen up!

202
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,150
Writer has run away.

203
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,480
We are in a bind. There is no place to retreat to.

204
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,650
Yumi couldn't meet the deadline today, and she lost the manuscript for the next three weeks.

205
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,970
As far as the ending goes, she doesn't even have any ideas.

206
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,580
- Oh, no.
- What should she do?

207
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,290
All that she has left is a missed deadline, malicious comments,

208
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,840
and the interest on her loan.

209
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,150
So today's strategy...

210
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,130
is the 36th strategy!
(From The Thirty-Six Strategems: "If all else fails, retreat.")

211
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,220
- Is that a strategy?
- Thirty-sixth?

212
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,210
As soon as the ceremony ends, Yumi will leave the ceremony hall,

213
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,620
turn her phone off, and go to Mom's house.
- What?

214
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,730
And then she'll disappear!

215
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,820
Until when? Until Writer comes back and she comes up with a plan!

216
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:14,050
That's the only way that Writer Kim Yumi will survive today!

217
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,000
What makes love complete isn't passion ...

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,340
Oh, wait! It's Ba Bi. It's Ba Bi!
[New message from Yu Ba Bi]

219
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,040
Happiness is ...

220
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,950
Yumi. How are you?

221
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,870
You're probably at the wedding right now.

222
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,850
I got a call saying that you left your laptop at the café.

223
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,440
I went to get it so I could bring it to you at the wedding,

224
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,850
but I don't think I can make it because there is traffic.

225
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,130
What time did you say your flight was?

226
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,850
I'm actually leaving for Singapore today.

but I left your laptop in the airport locker.

234
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,690
I was trying to help you, but I'm afraid I ended up inconveniencing you. I'm sorry.

- Oh, Wung!
- My meeting ended late. The ceremony isn't over, right?

260
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,500
The ceremony is over. Everyone's eating. Go on and head inside.

Where are you going?

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,580
I need to go find something.

- What?
- My laptop. I lost my laptop. Today's my deadline.

Yes. No.

00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,490
It was delayed. There's heavy rain over there.

298
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,210
I think it happened so I can see you before I go.

- No. I don't have time to.
- Really?

Whats this?

313

My heart is fluttering!

316
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,520
Hey, hey! Are you guys starting up again?

317
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,550
Is this the first or second time? Knock it off!

318
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,360
Ba Bi always speaks in a sweet manner.

319
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,060
We know, we know.

320
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,910
What about you?

321
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,850
- Me?
- Do you have a girlfriend?

322
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,490
I am seeing someone.

323
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,050
- What's this?
- See. You heard him, right?

324
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,780
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I know. I said I know!

325
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,920
Did I say anything?

326
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,850
I see. I hope it goes well.

327
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,440
Team Leader Ba Bi.

328
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,480
We have to go in now.

329
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,430
Oh, really?

330
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,970
I'll head in.

331
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,210
Okay. Have a good trip.

332
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,560
Take care.

333
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,870
By the way, was that woman from earlier your girlfriend?

334
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,780
Oh, she's not.

335
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,690
For some reason, I thought the vibe was ...

336
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,640
She's my ex-girlfriend.

337
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
What about now?

338
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
It's been a while since we broke up.

339
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,060
Then why was she at the airport?

340
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,570
Things ended up that way coincidentally.

341
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,550
- It looked as if she was a girlfriend coming to see me off, right?
- Yes.

342
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,040
But, Team Leader, why won't you go on any blind dates?

343
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,660
I've recommended several women, but you said you didn't want to meet any of them.

344
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,280
- Because I don't want to.
- Why?

345
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,450
Why are you smiling?

346
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,770
Why aren't you going on any dates?

347
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,550
I'm not sure.

348
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,810
I don't really know why, either.

349
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,030
Episode 40
The Return

350
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,290
Love disappeared one year ago on Christmas Eve.

351
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,550
♫ I didn't hear anything  ♫

352
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,220
♫  The small light went out ♫

353
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,370
Dating, damn you! This damned love affair!

354
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,530
I'm telling you it's exasperating!

355
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,540
The day that Love turned into the incarnation of rage

356
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,090
Love.
♫ Ling Ling don't make a sad face ♫

357
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,760
♫ Without my being vigilant in my heart there is no suspicious intent ♫

358
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,590
Give the prime cell position to Writer.

359
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,330
♫ Ling Ling don't try to be understanding ♫

360
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:27,760
♫ Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person ♫

361
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,110
and got kicked out of her position as the prime cell.

362
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,220
Love, who was banished to another dimension,

363
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,180
didn't return even when Yumi ran into Wung as if it were fate,

364
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,400
or even when she got back together with Ba Bi.

365
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,830
Yumi, should we...
♫ I'll keep remembering the past. We're going to fall. ♫

366
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,410
get married?
♫ Even so it's better than being dizzy ♫

367
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:10,140
Let's get married.
♫ Ling Ling you're such a fool ♫

368
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,610
Even when she was proposed to...
♫ There isn't anyone who loves you ♫

369
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,570
I have been
♫ as much as I do ♫

370
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,440
thinking about it a lot all this time.
♫ Ling Ling you'll know eventually ♫

371
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,610
I think I know what you're going to say.
♫ Ordinary things ♫

372
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,780
and even when they were breaking up, Love didn't come back.
♫ don't suit you at all ♫

373
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,290
- I'm better at that.
- Wait, why?

374
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,670
Of course, it's not like there was never a time when her heart fluttered after that.

375
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Writer Yumi!

376
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,880
Oppa!

377
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,420
Mr. Yeon In*?
(Also means one's love)

378
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,460
Oh, my friend said he wanted to greet you before he left. Say hello, Yeon In. This is Writer Yumi.

379
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,150
Hello.

380
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,760
Hello.

381
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,720
I'm really enjoying My Love Muse.

382
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,700
Thank you.
♫ Error! Error! ♫

383
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,360
- It's Love! Love is here!
- She said Love is here!

384
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,300
So she's finally back!

385
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,200
She sometimes wonders, "Is this possibly a romantic feeling?" But...

386
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,370
Me? I'm not Love, I'm Curiosity.

387
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,540
There are a lot of cases where it's not.

388
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,970
It's Curiosity. It's Curiousity!

389
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,140
What's going on? Why is he acting like that?

390
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,260
- You guys were all fooled.
- So annoying.

391
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,060
Romance

392
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,940
Ma'am,

393
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,170
here is the book you were looking for.

394
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,970
- Thank you.
- Wow, he's handsome.

395
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,580
It must be real this time!

396
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,480
Love has really come back!

397
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,260
Handsome men are innocent.

398
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,390
Where's Love?

399
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,030
It's not her.

400
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,640
It's not her!

401
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,930
It was Sensitivity.

402
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,080
- What the heck?
- I'm so annoyed.

403
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,040
Excuse me.

404
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,310
I think you dropped this.

405
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,180
Thank you.

406
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,290
Really, really, my heart just dropped.

407
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,600
It is real this time. This time it's really Love!

408
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:09,170
Guys, isn't that guy so sexy?

409
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,370
I want to touch his arms just once.

410
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,170
Get rid of him.

411
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,070
At first, there were times we were fooled by her feelings,

412
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,290
but now Yumi doesn't fall for it either.

413
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,820
Eonni. You were piercing a hole with your eyes at Oppa Z's friend.

414
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,860
Are you falling in love?

415
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,990
It's not like that. Go away.

416
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,600
- That's suspicious.
- I told you it wasn't like that.

417
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,780
Okay.

418
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,410
Will Love return this Christmas?

419
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,160
No.

420
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,730
This Christmas, these guys returned.

421
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,190
Fat

422
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,990
Fat cells.

423
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,200
We have finally arrived on a new land.

424
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,010
This is where we will be living from now on.

425
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,150
Leader!

426
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,440
Then where do we settle down at?

427
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,950
Let's go to Gaseum*!
(Refers to the chest or heart.)

428
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,070
Gaseum! Gaseum! Gaseum!
Gaseum 2 Yumi miles

429
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,220
No, let's go to Yeopguri*!
(Refers to the waist)

430
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,240
Huh?
Yeopguri 55 Yumi miles

431
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,190
- Yeopguri?
- Yeopguri is safe.

432
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,210
Once we settled on the waist, we are less likely to be kicked out.

433
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,600
On top of that, a lot of our Fat siblings already live there.

434
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,790
Let's go! Let's go!

435
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,900
Let's go!

436
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,230
To the paradise of happiness, Yeopguri!

437
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,190
Yeopguri!

438
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,420
- Yeopguri!
- Woo!

439
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,550
No, it's not that way. Come here.

440
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,400
It's not?

441
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,330
Seriously, why can't I figure this out?

442
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,550
Yumi is currently suffering a deadline syndrome, pressured to finish her manuscript before the deadline.

443
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,710
♫ I also wouldn't know ♫

Just five chapters.

♫ There's a me ♫

448

Why is it so messy?

Reason, how about we clean the room before we write?

454
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,510
Wait, are you crazy?!

455
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,190
Why are you doing things you don't normally do, on the day of her deadline?!

456
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,630
Reason, I suddenly really want to find out where the best vacation spots are

457
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,000
that Hollywood celebs go.

458
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,820
Let's try looking it up, huh?

459

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,870
everything except the deadline becomes interesting.

465
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,280

♫ Even if I knew I can't do anything with my heart ♫

473
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,150
This is so fun!

474
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,310
It's been a while, should I wash the blankets, too?

475
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,620
That's enough!

476
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,550
I'm going crazy.

477
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,180
Why are the last five chapters so hard?

478
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,370
I'm even sleepy.

479
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,590
Hello?

480
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,140
Eonni, when are you done?

481
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,070
I don't know. I don't have a plan.

482
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,140
I don't think I'm going to meet the deadline.

483
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,880
What do you mean?

484
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,720
We are all preparing a party and waiting for you!

485
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,100
A party?

486
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,530
Everyone is waiting to congratulate you when you finish your manuscript.

487
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,570
In the middle of the day?

488
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,920
We're going to start now and go on all night.

489
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,270
Hurry up and come.

490
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,680
Miss Writer, it's not a lie. The microbrew here is amazing. Hurry over!

491
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,350
Eonni Yi Da said she's coming too. Straight from her honeymoon trip.

492
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,710
Are you going to sit alone in your room and write all night on Christmas Eve?

493
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,560
Eonni, do you really want to live like that?

494
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,680
No.

495
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,910
So quickly finish and come here!

496
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,970
A party?

497
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,480
That sounds good.

498
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
What?

499
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,600
I just thought of something.

500
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,880
If I make the ending happen at a year-end party...

501
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,900
Eonni, I can't hear you very well.

502
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,150
Ah, that's right! That's it!

503
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,190
That's where they meet for the first time.

504
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,130
Coincidentally, at the year-end party.

505
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,770
The music is so loud that they can't even exchange names.

506
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,320
What? What did you just say?

507
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,370
Okay, I'm hanging up!

508
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,160
That's right.
♫ Are you paying attention to me? ♫

509
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,740
This is how it can go.
♫  Or is it meaningless? ♫

510
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,110
♫ Do our eyes keep meeting? ♫

511
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,460
♫ Or were you just looking at something behind me? ♫

512
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,490
That day was Christmas Eve.

513
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,780
Yeon Jae, who is going to the year-end party thrown by her company,

514
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,640
ends up meeting him as if it's fated.
♫ I'm going to continue to hide it ♫

515
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,520
♫ so you won't know how I feel ♫

516
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,550
But because the music is too loud,

517
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,780
she can't hear him when he tells her his name.

518
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,110
♫ Am I the only one you're nice to? ♫

519
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:46,280
But he remembered Yeon Jae's name. ♫ Am I the only one who thinks so? ♫

520
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,450
Like a miracle.

521
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,490
When a writer's block suddenly clears,
♫ I really want to know how you feel ♫

522
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,720
it's extremely thrilling.
♫ What is obvious ♫

523
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,950
Then it's immediately time for Endorphin.
Endorphin

524
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,920
Everyone, we're here!
♫ Although there aren't enough clues ♫

525
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,120
♫ I have my hunch that I care about you ♫

526
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
Everybody shout together!

527
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,350
Who are we?

528
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,460
En-dor-phin!

529
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,450
"I remember."
"What?"

530
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,350
♫ Oh, I want to hear your heart ♫

531

The End

532
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,800
Enter

533
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,380
The end.

534

I sent you the manuscript ^^

537
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,810
I'm done!

538
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,960
It's done!!!

539
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,810
It's been a year since she became a writer. During that time, Yumi wrote two novels, My Love Muse

540
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,420
and its sequel.

541
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,770
It's so refreshing.

542
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:15,420
Kim Yumi, you worked hard.

543
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,130
- Good job, Yumi.
- Good job, Yumi.

544
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,170
You worked hard, Yumi!

545
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,890
Good job, Yumi.

546
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,910
The cell village is also busy at the end of the year.

547
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,640
After the Endorphin concert, there's a year-end awards ceremony.

548
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,380
It's a beautiful night.

549
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,840
Yumi Awards

550
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,250
All right, then. I'll announce this year's award winners.

551
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,110
End of the year closing.

552
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:48,340
This year's Best Cell Award selected by Yumi's cells goes to ...

553
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,360
It can't be any other cell but me. It's embarrassing to pretend not to know.

554
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,410
The Best Cell Award!

555
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,020
The winner is... The winner is...

556
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,590
We'll be back after the commercials.

♫ Welcome to Ba Bi's world! Hola! ♫

565
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,170
I can't believe this, seriously!

566
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:31,050
As Ba Bi's cells are currently living overseas,

567
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,720
they are unable to attend the award ceremony.

568
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,580
- I will accept in their—
- Hey!

569
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,270
I'm the one who made Yumi a writer!

570
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,090
And I made the first and second books a success!

571
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,600
Naturally, you should be giving that award to me!

572
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,930
What kind of bulls**t is this award ceremony!

573
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,090
Let me go!

574
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,890
Writer, calm down.

575
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,660
You are the one who wrote the books, but Ba Bi was the one who saved you.

576
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,640
What? Ba Bi saved me?

577
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,250
So I'm wondering, can you write something for me?
♫ Let's build a little house ♫

I think you would do well, Assistant Manager Yumi.
♫ in front of the river ♫

579

The first one to recognize our talent was Ba Bi.
♫ Let's raise our dreams ♫

580
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,330
The one who always supported us was also Ba Bi.

♫ My dear, ♫

Oh, right.

597
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,640
Once she finished the book, there was something she had to do first.

598
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,540
What is this?

599
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,980
[Laptop]

600
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,240
Hello.

601
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,870
Wung. Why did you send a laptop?

602
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,080
Oh! It arrived?

603
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,950
You said you lost yours. I thought you would need one right away.

604
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,200
You're not tech savvy.

605
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,100
Wait ... Wung, I'm grateful, but I found my laptop.

606
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,620
Oh, really? That's great.

607
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,840
So I will send this back to you.

608
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,800
That's okay. Just use it.

609
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,640
It has the best performance because it's the latest model.

610
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,040
No, I can't. Why would you buy me a laptop?

611
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,130
Why? It could just be a gift from a fan.

612
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,760
So you can write good stories.

613
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,840
No, this is really not right. I will send it back to you.

614
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,730
If you send it back then I will send it back to you again.

615
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,500
What?

616
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,860
And if you send it again then I will it back to you again and again.

617
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,980
Come on, what kind of stubbornness is that?

618
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,680
I have a call coming in.

619
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,810
Talk to you later.

620
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,400
Hello? Wung?

621
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,540
So she went to return it personally.

622
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,490
Oh! Miss Yumi!

623
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,600
Aren't you Miss Yumi?

624
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,680
Mr. Louis, it's been a long time.

625
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,990
It's certainly been a long time.

626
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,510
What brings you here?

627
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,150
Come in.

628
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,150
I can wait in the lobby, though.

629
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,040
What are you saying?

630
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,040
If ever I let you wait in the lobby

631
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,310
then Wung, that punk

632
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:18,170
no, I mean CEO Gu would kill me.

633
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,650
It's about time for the meeting to be over, so wait for a moment.

634
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,250
Sure.

635
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,000
Please be comfortable.

636
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,350
Sorry ... can I ask for your autograph later?

637
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,170
Autograph?

638
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:41,130
Yes. My girlfriend is a fan of "My Love Muse."

639
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,040
Yes.

640
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,960
Then I will be back for your autograph later.

641
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,970
- Please be comfortable.
- All right.

642
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,570
I'm impressed.

643
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,570
Gu Wung has really succeeded.

644
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,770
KU WOONG GAMES CEO Gu Wung.

645
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,780
Wait. I think I have seen this name a lot somewhere.

646
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,800
Storm Man. UlaUla.

647
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,400
My Ssarang Muse.

648
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,290
Walwal*
(To be quick.)

649
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,640
It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world!

650
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
I can't wait for Monday!

651
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,090
The writer is a genius at the very least.

652
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,540
She's messing with the readers! Amazing!

653
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,790
- Kim Yumi is the best!
- Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript!

654
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,600
My Love Muse is the best!

655
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,200
Writer Kim Yumi is the best!

656
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,590
That's right.

657
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:58,130
The usernames that kept on posting compliments every morning.

658
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,940
All this time, Wung was the one who posted those?

659
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,810
♫ Even if I don't extend my hand the feeling of warmth ♫

660
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,800
Every day for a year, without missing one day?

661
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,930
How could this be? I got so much strength from all those comments.

662
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,040
This is really so like Gu Wung.
♫ comes and comforts me ♫

663
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,730
Gu Wung! Gu Wung! Gu Wung!
♫ Like a star ♫

666
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,340
I have an emergent suggestion.
♫ Like a star shining in the dark night ♫

667
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,700
Let's make one more cell award for this year.
♫ always shine brightly by my side ♫

668
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,680
Wung's cells as a co-winner.

669
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,050
♫ Like a star ♫

670
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,300
♫ while looking at me smile brightly ♫

671
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,020
♫ You who are so precious to me ♫

672
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,640
Hello, sir.

673
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,600
♫ Always by my side ♫

674
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,220

675
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,200
Yumi!

676
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,180
Sir!

677
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,740
Are you okay?

678
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,230
I'm fine. I'm fine.

679
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,650
Are you really okay?

680
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm perfectly fine, so you can leave, Gye Rim.

681
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,870
Your slippers.

682
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,830
Thank you!

683
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,240
Are you really okay?
- I am totally fine.

684
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,230
Even if you have become the CEO, you haven't changed.

685
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,350
But ... what brings you here? I was so surprised to hear that you were here.

686
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,160
I came to bring the laptop.

687
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,750
What is this? I told you I won't take it back.

688
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,560
I also earn money well these days.

689
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,400
Also, I'm already very thankful,

690
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,210
so I can't accept this as well. I also have a conscience.

691
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:40,540
What are you so thankful for?

692
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,160
I have my reasons.

693
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,550
I'm really touched, Wung.

694
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,520
Let's eat dinner together. I will be done in thirty minutes.

695
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,010
I need to go.

696
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,460
- Where?
- I have to go to a year-end party, so I just stopped by on the way there.

697
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,170
I will get going.

698
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,910
Can't I go with you?

699
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,560
It's a year-end party at the publishing company.

700
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,520
I know Control Z too.

701
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Let's grab a meal together some other time.

702
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,460
It's my treat.

703
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,880
- Why?
- Because I'm thankful.

704
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,460
Merry Christmas, Wung.

705
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,550
Merry Christmas.

708
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,040
That's great news.

709
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,390
I'm having a tropical Christmas. Merry Christmas.

710
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,520
Even though a breakup is the end for love

711
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:49,870
I'm starting to realize these days that a breakup does not mean it's the end of a connection with them.

712
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,150
Yumi!

713
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,420

716
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,730

Our publishing company worked so hard this year! Especially our Writer Kim Yumi!

724
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,740
Thank you so much.

725

Cheers!
- Cheers!

727
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,950
This year's Christmas is pretty good.

728

00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,640

Strangely it's a sleepless night.

747
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,990
Reason.

748
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,890

It's me, Sensitivity.

750
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,010
I suddenly wanted to sing a song.

I don't know. I feel restless for some reason.

It's Christmas Eve.

I am asking that cell, not myself.

00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,260
It's me, Love.

771
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,740
Hi, guys.

Love!

When did you come back?

774
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,960
A few days ago.

775
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,580
A few days ago?

776
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,530
I don't exactly know whether it was a few days or today?

777
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,620
Because I was suddenly sucked in.

778
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,530
Where am I?

779
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,950
When I opened my eyes, I was back.

780
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:20,250
I'm late because I had to walk back from the desert.

781
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,040
I couldn't fly because I'm not the prime cell.

782
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,240
Anyway, it's good to see you, even though I don't know how you got back.

783
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,890
I missed you.

784
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,530

785
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,550
I missed you guys too!

Love came back on Christmas Eve.

787
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,950
She came back after a year.

788
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,110
I'm not sure how she was able to come back.

789
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,170
Was it because of Ba Bi?

790
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,130
Merry Christmas!

791
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,510
Or was it because of Wung?

792
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,350
Let's go!

793
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,160
Merry is celebrating Christmas!

794
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,290
Hurry, come in.

795
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:21,590
Come in. It's fine, it's fine.

796
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,740
Come here.

797
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,150
Writer, these people are the next generation of our publishing company.

798
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,790
I brought them here to introduce you.

799
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,530
Hello!

800
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,820
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

801
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,740
Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

802
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,880
When Miss Mi Yeon goes on maternity leave,

803
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,070
you will be working with this guy right here starting next year.

804
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,510
Sorry?

805
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:51,780
- I said he is the one who will be responsible for you starting next year.
- Uh huh. Oh!

806
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,770
Hello!

807
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,400
Let's do our best, fighting!

808
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,130
Let's do it!

809
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:03,010
Or was it because of another reason?
♫ The day starts ♫

810
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,270
Is it Love?

811
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,260
Love?
♫ as if being shoved ♫

812
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,750
- Hey!
- Love!

813
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,280
Love!

814
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,650
Love!

815
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,390
You guys!
♫ I spend the day constantly ♫

816
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,080
Whatever the reason, it's good.
♫ acting fearless ♫

817
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,170
Because Love returned

818
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,800
and Yumi was ready to be happier.

819
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:23,610
♫ The dark night ♫

820
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:30,800
♫ The sadness which I've endured all day ♫

821
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:38,630
♫ arrives like a routine ♫

822
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,210
- Wow.
- Yes!

823
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,420
Here, grab my hand.

824
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,720
Love, sit here.
♫ I hide in the middle of nowhere ♫

825
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,520
Thanks.
♫ Pathetically with a thud landing on the floor ♫

826
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,490
It's nice.
♫ I am crying ♫

827
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,050
Wow, it looks like cotton candy.

828
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,890
Would that taste good, too? ♫ Today, too ♫

829
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,100
- We can't miss
- a moment like this.

830
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,720
Yumi! Aren't you happy?

831
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:11,540
♫ Dark feelings will be passed tonight ♫

832
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,900
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

833
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,300
I want to have a snowball fight.

834
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,560
It's even better looking at it from up high.

835
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,670
Look at that!

836
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,760
It's really nice.

837
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:41,430
♫ I'm going tonight to the shining place ♫

838
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:49,440
♫ We are going to the shining place ♫

839
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,820
My stomach hurts.

840
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,270
Did I drink too much?

841
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,180
Unknown: Writer, did you get home safely yesterday?

842
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,990
Unknown?

843
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,290
Who could it be?

844
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,720
Unknown: Writer, did you get home safely yesterday?

845
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,590
Who could it be?

846
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,500
Oh, it must the publishing house employee.

847
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,130
I don't have his number.

848
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,980
Yes, I got home all right.

849
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,580
But I'm sorry because I drank a lot yesterday,

850
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,820
I don't really remember who you are.

851
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,370
Oh, I introduced myself to you yesterday.

852
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,250
I will be working with you starting next year when Team Leader Mi Yeon takes her maternity leave.

853
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,400
Oh, that's right.

854
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,740
He did introduce himself.

855
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,360
What was his name?

856
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,960
My name is Sin Sun Rok.
