Yumi's Cells 2

2
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,810
Episode 07
Heart Fever time

3
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,490
Look at this. Look.

4
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,190
Her body is really amazing.

5
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,810
If you see her in person, she looks even more glamorous. She's really the best out of all my friends.

6
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,460
She got street casted several times.

7
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,990
- Really?
- Yes.

8
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,440
How is her body like that? What does she do? Is she a Pilates instructor?

9
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,710
- A pharmacist.
- A Pharmacist?

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,950
Yes.

11
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,820
- She's a pharmacist and her body is like that?
- And her personality is really good.

12
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,400
She's my friend, but it's really annoying.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,480
I really struggled a lot to do my best in trying to put a good-looking man and woman together.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,230
Yeah, she would look good with Assistant Manager Ba Bi. I can see it.

15
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,600
- You can, right?
- Yes.

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,790
- Do you think it will work out well?
- Yes.

17
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,250
Assistant Manager Ba Bi's ex-girlfriend was a reporter.

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,100
I saw her on the news a few times. She's pretty and so smart.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,430
Yeah, if he can't date because he can't forget his ex, then this will do it.

20
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,940
Exactly, that's why I did my best.

21
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,790
Why do you need to work so hard? It's Ba Bi's business to take care of.

22
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,410
But he hasn't.

23
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,650
It's a waste of national resources to have such a good-looking guy be single.

24
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,620
For the future of our country, I'm going to keep trying to set him up until it works.

25
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,520
Hey, what the heck. Th-that's her.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
Oh, you're right. The reporter.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,180
When we use and throw away a paper cup,

28
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,680
one of the most commonly used convenience items, it results in a 7 g carbon footprint.

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Fossil fuels are used in the process of producing and distributing paper cups...

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,170
See, she is both intelligent and beautiful, like your friend.

31
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,930
It's exactly Yu Ba Bi's type. Hey, I think it's going to work out well.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,740
- I just got the feeling.
- You just got it?

33
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,480
Just got the feeling?

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,100
Ruby, that girl... seriously.

35
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,620
She's completely useless in life. She just chooses to do things she shouldn't do.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,090
What kind of enemy did Yumi lose to in a previous life?

37
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,050
What did Ruby do wrong?

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,240
Yeah, Ruby did nothing wrong. Actually, this is all...

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,140
Love's fault!

40
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,310
I will walk you home.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,660
- No, it's okay.
- It's on the way.

42
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,650
Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,020
Let's...

44
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,080
be friends.

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,230
I want us to be good friends.

46
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,620
It's because Love said we should be friends at that moment.

47
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
What do you mean friends?!

48
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,320
Ba Bi is going on a blind date because she said that nonsense!

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,170
If you're not going to date, then you should draw the line. What are you supposed to do?

50
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,150
They could just date, why draw the line?

51
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,460
The one who had the hardest time after breaking up with Wung is you, Sensitivity!

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,640
Every night you used to drink and sing. Did you already forget?

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,540
I did but Ba Bi made me forget it.

54
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,530
Only Ba Bi can make me forget.

55
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,610
Ba Bi is the only answer! So why, why, why not?

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,820
- I really need to quit drinking coffee.
- How can you quit?

57
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,610
- My skin is dry.
- No, it's not. It's nice.

58
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,400
Are you coming back from lunch?

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,650
- Assistant Manager Ba Bi.
- Did you have lunch?

60
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,610
Yes, I did.

61
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,810
My friend said she is really looking forward to it.

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,120
You two take care of the location.

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,140
But my friend said Gangnam Station is more convenient.

64
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,580
I see. Okay.

65
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,730
BB fighting!

66
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,330
What the heck.

67
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,010
I'm annoyed. Why am I so annoyed?

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,070
Assistant Manager Yumi.

69
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,570
Yes?

70
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,590
Can you come to the conference room for a moment to talk about the revisions?

71
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,880
Yes.

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,920
This section only appeals to teenagers, so if we could change it to standard language...

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,110
- Sensitivity: Let's tell him not to go on the blind date.
- Reason: Are you crazy?

74
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,350
Sensitivity: Tell him we didn't mean it and that the truth is Yumi also likes Ba Bi.

75
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,740
Reason: Are you crazy?

76
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,800
Sensitivity: A person's feelings can change. We can just say we were flustered because of the sudden confession.

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,010
- Sensitivity: That's the truth.
- Reason: Are you joking?

78
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,610
Sensitivity: I can't watch Yu Ba Bi meet that glamorous pharmacist!

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,980
Assistant Manager Yumi?

80
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,770
Reason: Yumi.

81
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,120
- Yes?
- Did you hear what I just said?

82
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,420
Sorry?

83
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,390
- I see you were thinking of something else.
- Uh, no...

84
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,470
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,720
What were you thinking about?

86
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,220
It's now. Let's tell him now.

87
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,120
That's enough!

88
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,610
But do you guys remember?

89
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,320
Babi threw away the couple ring he wore with his ex

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,310
without a second thought.

91
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,560
- That's right. He did.
- Like that?

92
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,690
That kind of personality is endlessly sweet but once it's over, he's the type that doesn't even look back.

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,150
I think he already gave up on Yumi.

94
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,300
The moment they said she said be friends, it was over.

95
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,370
- Yeah, that's right.
- What do you mean? We haven't even tried telling him yet.

96
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,400
You can tell me. Don't you like the revisions?

97
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,430
No.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,010
I will think about it a bit.

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,550
I think the answer will come out if I think about it.

100
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,800
Then, will you?

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,030
Yes.

102
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Still, it would be nice if he didn't go on the blind date.

103
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,920
Day of Yu Ba Bi's blind date.

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,500
Saturday night 7:55 pm.

105
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,850
There's no better time to text with your boyfriend or guy you like.

106
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,700
Did you get home all right?

107
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,460
- Have a good night.
- Have a good weekend.

108
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,850
Although the words are meaningless in life

109
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,470
they are the world's sweetest words.

110
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,030
How long has it been since we sent those kinds of texts on a Saturday night?

111
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,530
Yet Yu Ba Bi, who went on a blind date, is probably

112
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,410
exchanging useless but sweet texts with her by now, right?

113
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,660
Damn it.

114
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,080
- Sensitivity.
- What?

115
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,920
Yumi says to please shut up.

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Will you shut up?! That guy... really!

117
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,370
It would be nice if I could sleep early on a day like today.

118
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,860
But I'm not sleepy.

119
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,090
♫ Sweet cologne, truth be told ♫

120
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,740
♫ Truth be told ♫

121
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,600
♫ You and I, ♫

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,300
♫  are walking on the same path♫

123
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,060
♫ When this night passes  ♫

124
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,320
♫ Oh, we'll know  ♫

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,060
♫ Oh, we'll know,  ♫

126
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,010
♫ At sunrise ♫

127
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,550
♫ You and I ♫

128
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,540
I fell asleep.

129
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,800
What time is it now?

130
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,790
New Message from Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi

131
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,060
What's this? We got a text from Yu Babi?

132
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,410
Assistant Manager Yumi
I want to return your umberella.

133
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,020
Can I come by your place for a moment?

134
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,180
What is this? What is this all of a sudden?

135
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,220
- It's Ba Bi!
- It's a text from Ba Bi!

136
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,780
Ba Bi? Really?

137
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,590
He's coming by?

138
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,130
What is this? What is he saying all of a sudden?

139
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,430
He's asking if he can come by my place? Now?

140
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,610
Let's all shout together!

141
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,750
You can come! You can come!

142
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,350
You can come!

143
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,840
When did he send this?

144
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,010
8:59 pm. What's the time now?

145
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,460
2:20... in the morning.

146
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,300
2:22 in the morning?!

147
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,700
Are you saying we were sleeping?

148
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,470
Are you saying we didn't see Ba Bi's text because we were sleeping?!

149
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,900
He's saying we weren't able to reply because we were sleeping until 2 am?!

150
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,710
Hey! We can just send a reply now.

151
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,760
- Yeah!
- Let's send it!

152
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,490
It's 2 in the morning. Are you guys crazy?

153
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,670
Even if it's 2 am, we can't just go to sleep.

154
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,540
I'm just now seeing your message because I fell asleep.

155
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,300
You can return my umbrella later.

156
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,500
Have a good night.

157
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,910
I tried waving my hand at a bus that has already left.

158
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,410
I am always like this.

159
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,860
Always a step late.

160
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,270
Yumi, look at that!

161
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,600
Yu Ba Bi isn't asleep.

162
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,210
He's writing a reply.

163
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,900
He's not asleep at this hour.

164
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,940
And on the day of his blind date.

165
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,050
And it's a very long reply.

166
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,150
If it's this long, it'll probably be over 100 characters.

167
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,630
Okay, when I count to three,

168
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,440
we will all shout "Oh yay!" together.

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,220
Oh yay!

170
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,640
- Guys, would you just please calm down?
- Shout loudly.

171
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
One, two...

172
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Guys, we're in trouble. Ba Bi deleted whatever he was typing.

173
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,270
- What!
- No!

174
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,150
Where did it go?

175
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,230
Why did he stop writing? He was writing something till just now.

176
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,450
What's going on? Why did he stop writing?

177
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,420
Does that mean he's coming right now? Or was it the result of his blind date today?

178
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,310
Perhaps a confession that he was reminded of Yumi more because he went on a blind date?

179
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,190
I am dying of curiosity. What did he write and then delete?!

180
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,920
He was writing something and he deleted it!

181
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,510
Can't we ask what he wrote?

182
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,620
Are you guys crazy? How can we ask something like that?

183
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,600
Why can't you? You coward!

184
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,330
- Why is that being a coward–
- Hey!

185
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,010
- Yu Ba Bi started to type something again.
- What?

186
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,350
Yes, Yu Ba Bi. Anything is fine so just type!

187
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,690
And I'll show you why we're the Yu Ba Bi club!

188
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,500
Are you free tomorrow morning?

189
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,830
Wow! He wants to meet!

190
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,230
- Before Yu Ba Bi changes his mind and says something else, let's hurry and nail it in.
- Okay!

191
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,540
Stay right there! Nail in our plans! Bang Bang!

192
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,090
The skill of immediately accepting someone's suggested plan

193
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,430
and nailing it in so that they cannot change their mind.

194
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,690
Ah, yes. It's fine by me. At what time should we meet then?

195
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,140
Is ten o'clock okay? Should we meet in front of that café nearby your place?

196
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,280
Yes, that's fine.

197
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,210
This is the first time Ba Bi asked us to meet first since that day, right?

198
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,700
He can return the umbrella at work, but if he insists.

199
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,860
This is our last chance. It's really the last.

200
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,380
If we waste this chance like a fool again, then our relationship with Ba Bi

201
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,270
will end as being friends forever.

202
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,800
Sensitivity, should Yumi do an effortless look?

203
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,990
No. Let's not do an effortless look.

204
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,550
This time, do everything that you can do.

205
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,100
♫ To the point where there's no gap ♫

206
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,630
♫ Fill me up fully with you ♫

207
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,900
♫ Cause you're beautiful ♫

208
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,720
♫ As much as I can't even breathe ♫

209
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,830
♫ I'm falling for you ♫

210
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,730
♫ When I fall in love with you ♫

211
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,480
Moisturize. Shine. Let's do it all.

212
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,850
♫ You're there, Oh ♫

213
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,220
♫ I have something to tell you  ♫

214
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,520
♫  I want to carefully come up to you ♫

215
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,630
♫ and whisper ♫

216
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,680
Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

217
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,100
Oh, hello.

218
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,240
You're early.

219
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,690
Please stop. Please just calm down!

220
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,850
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

221
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,360
- Guys, just so you know, Yu Babi went on a blind date yesterday and
- Bang. Bang.

222
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,730
- we don't know the outcome yet.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

223
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,380
He might have wanted to return the umbrella quickly because he just felt uncomfortable!

224
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,230
What do you think? Is your heart still pounding?

225
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,070
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

226
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,110
- You guys seriously!
- Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

227
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,370
- Here's your umbrella.
- Thanks.

228
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,510
But it seems like you have plans today.

229
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,520
Ah, I had to go stop by somewhere in the morning.

230
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,670
- I see. It's ten o'clock now, where did you...
- Ah...

231
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,080
BABI

232
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,680
You should have said you have plans after. How can you say that you came after dropping by somewhere?

233
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,970
Stupid! If we have plans after, we have to part ways immediately!

234
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,020
Can't you think?

235
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,200
Getting this dressed up to get an umbrella on a Sunday morning.

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,350
It's so ridiculous!

237
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,160
Shut up!

238
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,270
I'm going to get going then.

239
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,090
- Are you busy?
- What?

240
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,410
No. I'm on my way to exercise in the park.

241
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,210
Ah, then take a coffee with you. I'll buy it.

242
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,090
You're going to buy?

243
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,190
Of course, I should buy. What do you want to have?

244
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,200
Cafe mocha.

245
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,780
Okay.

246
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm going!

247
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,150
BABI

248
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,450
Wait a minute!

249
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,750
Stop. It's still a red light.

250
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,170
We still don't know the outcome of Yu Ba Bi's blind date.

251
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,310
If things are going well with Ruby's friend, what are you going to do, you wild girl?

252
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,550
Now that you mention it, you're right.

253
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,730
Let's find out how the blind date went first.

254
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,820
Fishing cell, help us.

255
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,310
I need you to hook me Yu Ba Bi's blind date outcome.

256
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,850
Here you go.

257
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,750
I guess even now you still exercise on weekends.

258
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,730
No, I haven't been able to these days.

259
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,970
I'm coming out for the first time in a long time.

260
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,490
Then what do you do on the weekends when you don't exercise?

261
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,160
Strangely these days, there are a lot of family events

262
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,350
and friends' weddings too.

263
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,520
Sensitivity: Yesterday, yesterday, you had a blind date.

264
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Yesterday I went on a blind date.

265
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,810
That's right. You said you were going on a blind date.

266
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,290
Yes.

267
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,890
Sensitivity: So? So what happened?

268
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,560
I guess you don't come out to exercise these days, Assistant Manager Yumi?

269
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,490
Right. I also haven't been able to come out these days.

270
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,520
Writer: Why did you stop talking about it? If you brought it up, you should come to a conclusion!

271
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,440
Sensitivity: What happened?

272
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,930
Anxiety: It must be going well. Isn't that why he purposefully brought it up?

273
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,190
The weather is so nice today.

274
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,000
- It's perfect for exercising, right?
- Yes.

275
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,430
Excuse me for a moment.

276
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,200
Guard: No way it's the woman he went on a blind date with, right?

277
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,510
Right?

278
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,730
Anxiety: Is it really over then?

279
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,630
Two cafe mochas are ready.

280
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,380
Sensitivity: I knew this would happen if we hesitated.

281
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,990
Here.

282
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,650
Ah, thank you.

283
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,910
- If you aren't busy shall we stay here—
- Let's leave.

284
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,420
- What?
- What?

285
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,430
Ah, yes, yes, let's leave.

286
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,340
Then, where are you going?

287
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,740
I should get home.

288
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,010
Then, go ahead. Thanks for the coffee.

289
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,150
- No problem. Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

290
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,010
Fashion: Is it over?

291
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,170
Guard: Did he really call us out just to return the umbrella?

292
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,900
- Face Wash-up: Ba Bi.
- Sensitivity: Ba Bi... Are you really going?

293
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,020
Anxiety: I guess he's really going.

294
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,680
Sensitivity: No, he's not going. He's not going.

295
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,730
Anxiety: Oh no.

296
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,920
Face Wash: What's going on?

297
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,030
Face Wash: Did we come out with pretty make-up on for this?

298
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,000
Writer: Then what do you want to do? He's gone.

299
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,440
Fashion: We got dressed up like this in vain. Let's just go anywhere.

300
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,890
Hello.

301
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,800
Are you busy, Eonni?

302
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,190
No. Why?

303
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,690
Eonni, do you perhaps know who Assistant Manager Ba Bi has feelings for?

304
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,430
He said there's someone and that he got rejected last time when we went out for drinks.

305
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,570
Do you know who that is?

306
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,110
Uh, no.

307
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,990
Do you not know? But you guys are close.

308
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,430
We aren't that close. And even if we were close, how would I know all that.

309
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,000
But why are you asking that?

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,520
Assistant Manager Ba Bi made plans with my friend for the blind date and then canceled them.

311
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,710
It's so ridiculous.

312
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,790
He cancelled?

313
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,380
The date was yesterday night but he sent her a text that morning saying he was sorry

314
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,900
that something urgent came up.

315
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,400
Yesterday I went on a blind date.

316
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,440
Didn't he go on the blind date yesterday?

317
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,190
No. I'm telling you he didn't.

318
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,660
- Then—
- So I called him and he apologized to me.

319
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,820
He said he wasn't ready yet.

320
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,110
He said he couldn't go out with my friend because it didn't seem polite.

321
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,840
It's so annoying.

322
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,250
What kind of a woman is she that she sways Yu Ba Bi's heart like that?

323
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,070
She's coming.

324
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,810
She's totally upset because of Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

325
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,720
Eonni, I'm going to go. Let me know if you know anything.

326
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,330
Sure.

327
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,190
Did you hear that? He didn't go on the blind date.

328
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,750
He didn't go on the blind date. He said he wasn't ready yet.

329
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,440
But he lied that he went on the blind date.

330
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
- Why?
- He thought

331
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,770
Yumi would feel burdened.

332
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,440
He actually didn't want to.

333
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,540
It was like that.

334
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,570
But he said that so that Yumi feels better.

335
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,820
Yumi asked him to be friends

336
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,900
so he purposely drew the line?

337
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,130
- You're shining.
- You're right.

338
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,050
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

339
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,170
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

340
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,310
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

341
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,770
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.

342
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,480
What is this?

343
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,790
- Isn't this heart fever time?
- What?

344
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,250
Yumi, go!

345
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,570
We are going to Yu Ba Bi!

346
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,420
Sensitivity finally exploded.

347
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,450
Heart Fever Time - Sensitivity's ultra power to make Yumi fall in love even without Love.

348
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,820
Excuse me, sorry to bother you.

349
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,110
Did you lose an umbrella?

350
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,860
You look pretty. Kim Yumi. I think you would do well.

351
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,850
I think it sounds good.

352
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,670
Temporary state of emotional outburst. There's nothing you can't do when you enter this state.

353
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,860
Yumi, run! Yumi, run!

354
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,300
Let's go! Yumi, run!

355
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,010
Yumi, run!

356
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,360
♫ and think about someone ♫

357
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,640
♫ Because in matter which had nothing to do with me ♫
Oh!

358
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,650
♫ I uselessly took an interest ♫

359
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,970
Damn it. I lost again.

360
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,460
I lost again.

361
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,690
However, the difference from Love's power is that

362
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,230
because it is temporary it doesn't last long.

363
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,960
But,

364
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,290
if I suddenly do this, won't he think I'm crazy?

365
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,260
He could have just not wanted to go on the blind date.

366
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,810
Yes.

367
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,680
This isn't it right.

368
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,190
You just rejected him. What are you trying to do now?

369
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,140
Anyway, I almost became an idiot.

370
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,510
So a year ago, that day when I looked back.

371
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,730
We still remember it.
[Wedding]

372
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,440
Yu Ba Bi & Kim In Yeong

373
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
Do you know

374
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,730
that I ran to you, Yu Ba Bi, that day?

375
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,560
Congratulations Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

376
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Hey, I'm jealous, you punk.

377
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,260
Congratulations.

378
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,300
Ah, but this is really making me shy.

379
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,210
Congratulations Manager Ba Bi.

380
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,040
Thank you.

381
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,090
Face Wash Up: I hate to even imagine something like that.

382
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,130
So let's squeeze it out once more.

383
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,380
Heart Fever Time!

384
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,370
♫ In the season which passes ♫

385
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,710
♫ in the moment which stopped wordlessly ♫

386
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,470
♫ perhaps while looking at each other ♫

387
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,280
♫ will we hang on? ♫

388
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,470
Excuse me.
♫ Although I am a little scared ♫

389
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,420
♫ of this approaching day ♫

390
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,420
♫ If it happens will you say to me ♫

391
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,190
♫ "you did well" and "good job"? ♫

392
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,610
Reason: But isn't this the same situation as before?

393
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,550
Watch out!

394
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,200
Reason: This situation seems the same as the day Wu Gi rejected us.

395
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,270
Reason: It was the same back then. We misunderstood things and had the courage for nothing.

396
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,990
Then Seonbae...

397
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,380
Yes?

398
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,200
Do you want to go on a blind date?

399
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,820
Reason: We just made memories that we wanted to forget.

400
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,650
That's right. Yes.

401
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Even the location

402
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,860
Let's stop doing stupid things.

403
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,760
How old are you now, Kim Yumi?

404
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,270
Assistant Manager Yumi?

405
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,540
What are you doing here?

406
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,030
What?

407
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,410
You said you were going home earlier.

408
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,190
You didn't come out to exercise, right?

409
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,260
Ah, the thing is...

410
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,620
We can't walk away now. It would be better

411
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,910
to get rejected and die heroically.

412
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,330
I'll squeeze out the last bit of power.

413
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,210
It's Heart Fever Time!

414
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,690
- The thing is...
- Yes.

415
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,740
I have something to tell you.

416
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,800
To me?

417
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,390
I also

418
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,090
want to know more about you.

419
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,310
What?

420
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,250
I also

421
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,060
like you.

422
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,590
One week later

423
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,580
Ms. Kim Yumi.

424
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,910
You eat healthily, you don't drink much as well.

425
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:03,970
I do have one or two cans of beer every week.

426
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,130
It's stress induced gastritis.

427
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,860
Recently, was something causing you a lot of stress?

428
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,650
Take medicine for the time being and stop drinking coffee.

429
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,030
All right.

430
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,620
Assistant Manager Yumi.

431
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,730
- Yes.
- Just a moment.
- Sure.

432
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,020
I think you need to revise everything you did this morning.

433
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,410
What? Everything?

434
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,010
It's an introduction of the new product but a lot of keywords are missing.

435
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,890
Ah, I see.

436
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,150
- I have marked the places that you have to revise so please refer to them.
- Okay.

437
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,160
- Are you okay, Assistant Manager Yumi?
- Pardon?

438
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,210
Just earlier, Assistant Manager Ba Bi was conveying exactly what the Department Head said during the meeting.

439
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,580
It's not his opinion.

440
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,300
Okay.

441
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,740
Just in case you misunderstand.

442
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,590
Oh, no it's alright. I have to fix it if there's editing needed.

443
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,330
Okay.

444
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,550
Well, amongst the meeting schedules

445
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,780
let me tell you.

446
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,260
Oh, right. He said I can't drink coffee.

447
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,630
Do you know the colors?

448
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,220
Yes.

449
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,440
- Assistant Manager.
- Yes?

450
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,990
I'm taking a look at it now. When should I have the editing done by?

451
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,480
Well, the sooner the better. Is it possible to do it by today?

452
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,060
- I'm going to have to.
- Do as much as you can.

453
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,240
I'm sorry, I should have done well from the start.

454
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,540
- Did your hospital visit go well?
- They said it's gastritis.

455
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,540
They say it's caused by stress

456
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,020
but I don't think I've been under a lot of stress recently.

457
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,930
I think it's just because you often eat a lot of spicy food.

458
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,860
Did I do that?

459
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,170
Couldn't it be because you eat food that is too spicy?

460
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,790
It could be.

461
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,810
Figures. I ate spicy soup even for lunch.

462
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,750
See.

463
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,020
Hello! Ah, yes, yes. I'll send it to you now.

464
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,710
What about medicine?

465
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,980
I took it.

466
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,700
Episode 08
Ba Bi's World

467
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,700
You all must remember the Gate of Heart, the only way to enter Yumi's village.

468
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,560
- It's a frog.
- The Gate of Heart has a twenty-eight character password.

469
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,470
If Wung's love cell disguised himself as a frog and entered,

470
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,640
You're okay, right?

471
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,740
Ba Bi will.. 
- Hang in there.

472
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,250
- What's that?
- What's that sound?

473
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,850
What is that?

474
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,180
- What is that?
- It's a stone fastball!* (T/N: means to be straightforward)

475
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,010
Ba Bi's strategy of attack is to be straightforward.

476
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,580
That band is busking in Ilsan. Do you want to go with me?

477
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,180
I don't know if I can...

478
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,060
You can.

479
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,330
Thank you.

480
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,520
You're someone whom I always want to get to know.

481
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,680
That's why I want to be with you.

482
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,570
I'm saying that we should date.

483
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,860
- It's coming again.
- Be careful! It's a very

484
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,830
straightforward comment!
♫ Everyday higher than the sky there ♫.

485
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:09,410
♫  My heart wants to express everything to you  ♫.

486
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,270
I'm so glad.

487
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,190
♫  Every day  ♫

488
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,370
I'm so glad that you waited for me.

489
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:23,370
♫ My heart wants to express everything to you  ♫

490
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,370
I also want to know more about you.

491
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,280
What?

492
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,780
I also like you.

493
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,870
♫  Everyday. Oh ♫

494
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,040
♫  Everyday  ♫

495
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,980
♫  and clear your clouds away Everyday  ♫

496
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,650
Then, I...

497
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,340
♫  Everyday higher than the sky there  ♫

498
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm going to go now.

499
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,720
Can we start now then?

500
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,880
Now, here?

501
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,500
What?

502
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,530
Start what?

503
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,480
Dating.

504
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,700
And in the end...

505
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,220
♫ A room without space to take a step ♫

506
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,010
This time, there are so many!

507
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:55,210
♫ With only dust flying under the light bulb ♫

508
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,830
Ba Bi's straightforwardness finally destroyed the Gate of Heart and the village succumbed.

509
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,640
We, the members of the Yu Ba Bi Club, call for Love.

510
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,490
Our feelings for Yu Ba Bi is not fanship anymore!

511
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,290
Is not fanship anymore!

512
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:22,070
Love should yield! Accept Yu Ba Bi!

513
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,830
Accept Yu Ba Bi!

514
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,450
Yumi's boyfriend is now Yu Ba Bi!

515
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,800
Love Ba Bi!

516
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,920
Love Ba Bi!

517
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,220
- Love Ba Bi!
- Love, you heard the news, right? The Gate of Heart has been destroyed.

518
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,070
I heard. Do you see that?

519
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,890
Yu Ba Bi club members are protesting for me to yield–

520
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,410
Don't tell me... you too?

521
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,500
I just...

522
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,810
It's funny right? I am wearing the Ba Bi T-shirt.

523
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,600
We decided to date him anyway.

524
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,800
How can all of you do this without my permission?

525
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,910
Of course. Your opinion matters the most.

526
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,680
If you say no, it's a no.

527
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,640
That's why even though the village has already been taken over, we haven't put up a white flag of surrender yet.

528
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,550
We started dating but since it's not love yet.

529
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,660
Do you also want Yumi to love someone?

530
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,480
About that... Honestly, I don't think it'll be easy to meet a guy like Yu Ba Bi again.

531
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,260
He's handsome, gentle, has similar tastes and he likes Yumi.

532
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,490
Oh, also we got a call from Yumi's Healthcare Headquarters.

533
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,960
The graph looks great these days.

534
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,770
She has maintained high self-esteem since she started dating him.

535
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,980
Thanks to Ba Bi, Yumi's mental health has improved.

536
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,470
Of course we don't have to rush anything as they are still getting to know each other.

537
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,930
Reason, I am afraid that I will get hurt again.

538
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,920
If that happens, then I really won't be able to wake up again.

539
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,610
Right, that shouldn't happen.

540
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,900
- Then I'll go tell the guys to stop–
- But this is the first time this has happened.

541
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,450
I'm talking about the village yielding.

542
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,000
This is how we started dating Ba Bi.
[Yield]

543
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,790
It wasn't Love's decision but because of the haphazard straightforward attacks and the village yielding.

544
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,160
Look there! Love accepted it!

545
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,590
Love accepted Ba Bi!

546
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,980
She did. It's a success!

547
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,320
It was a white flag surrender everyone was happy about, except Love.

548
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,010
Assistant Manager Yumi. This is last year's promotion project proposal you asked for.

549
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,630
Thank you.

550
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,660
2020 Promotion Project

551
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,990
Ah, yes.

552
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,720
You also printed out all the attached images.

553
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,750
- Yes, I thought you might need it.
- Thank you.

554
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,730
Sure. Good luck.

555
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,580
Do you want to go to Paju today?

556
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,920
I know a really good place in Paju. I think you will like it.

557
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,850
- Sounds good. Where is it?
- A publishing complex...

558
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,560
It's a reliable option,

559
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,460
but regarding the location, I'll coordinate and give you feedback again.

560
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,490
If you send me your ideas of the information through email, I will take a look.

561
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,830
Okay, I will. Oh, and for the meeting time

562
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,280
let's set it for 6:10 pm for now.

563
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,030
- All right. I got it.
- Okay.

564
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,210
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

565
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,130
Hello.

566
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,700
- You did a good job today.
- Same to you both.

567
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,210
Oh my gosh. Why is it so cold? It's really going to be the end of the year soon.

568
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,960
Are we going to be lonely again this Christmas?

569
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,520
I'm so sick of it.

570
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,230
Eonni, don't say things like that. It's so annoying.

571
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,240
It's okay. At least this year it's not the two of us but the three of us.

572
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,310
- You're right.
- I feel reassured because Yumi joined us.

573
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,220
- Let's be all together, Yumi.
- You have to join us.

574
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,860
- Eonni, I'm going to get going now.
- Okay.

575
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,220
- Oh! I'll go with you. I have to go to the mall. I want to take the subway.
- Okay.

576
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,530
- We're going.
- Bye.

577
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:26,940
Ba Bi got a new car last week and we commute to and from work together every day.

578
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,480
- Were you waiting long?
- I just got here.

579
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,480
- I'm hungry.
- What should we eat?

580
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,540
I like everything. You said we're going to Paju, right?

581
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,320
If we're going to Paju, then I know a really good place.

582
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,920
- Then should we go there?
- Do you want to go there?

583
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,500
Let's go there.

584
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,200
Hello.

585
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,160
This place is really good.

586
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,260
I can tell just by looking at it.

587
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,410
- What can I get you?
- Two servings of sundae (blood sausage), please.

588
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,290
Do you want me to mix in the entrails?

589
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,710
Of course! Mix it in.

590
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,050
The liver and lungs!

591
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,590
Mix, mix.

592
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,870
What are you doing? Hurry and tell her to mix it in.

593
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,910
Entrails. An animal's internal organs.

594
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,320
Why does that sound disgusting today?

595
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,220
Isn't liver and lungs a bit too much to eat in front of Ba Bi?

596
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,480
Then ask for some ear and heart.

597
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,460
That's even more disgusting.

598
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,690
Don't order entrails. Our Ba Bi doesn't eat entrails.

599
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,590
How do you know if he eats it or not?

600
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,570
Look at him. He doesn't look like he would eat entrails.

601
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,550
Then does Yumi look like she enjoys eating entrails?

602
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,480
Do you want to go to jail?

603
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,510
What do you want to do? Mix in the entrails?

604
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,100
Excuse me?

605
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,640
Do you eat entrails?

606
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,860
- Huh?
- Say you don't. It's the early stages of dating right now.

607
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,070
Don't scare off our Ba Bi.

608
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,300
- I...
- Okay. That's enough.

609
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,780
Yu Ba Bi club, I inform you that

610
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,750
our Sundae Entrails club respects all types of sundae preferences.

611
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,970
It doesn't matter if you don't order the entrails but!

612
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:03,040
We can't forgive you for disguising Yumi's preferences!

613
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,860
I ...

614
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:14,830
do like it but if you don't eat it we can leave it out.

615
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,910
- Mix it with the entrails. And add a lot of liver, please.
- Sure.

616
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,690
I like liver. What do you like?

617
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,950
- The lungs and ears.
- I like your tastes.

618
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,130
Please add a lot of lungs and ears too.

619
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,530
It really looks good.

620
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,400
Two hot Americanos, please.

621
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,380
Are you going to have them here?

622
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,680
Should we drink them in the car?

623
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,330
Sounds good.

624
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,790
- We'll take it to go.
- Okay.

625
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,180
Be careful, it's steep.

626
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,680
Okay.

627
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:10,640
Today I had the best sundae I've ever eaten.

628
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,790
- Right? Wasn't it good?
- Especially the ear.

629
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,680
The ears are special. The ears are–

630
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh my! Oh my!

631
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,180
Oh no!

632
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,220
98, 99...

633
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,610
Are you okay?

634
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,620
Yes.

635
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,780
That could have been bad.

636
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,470
Uh...

637
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,130
Uh... I guess we need to reorder our coffee.

638
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:33,030
I'm sorry.

639
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,980
No, it's okay.

640
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,540
- Are you tired?
- No.

641
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,810
Then, should we stop by Heyri?

642
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,420
- Heyri?
- It's a book café with a good vibe that I know.

643
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,620
- Is it too late?
- No, sounds good.

644
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,610
Is it far from here?

645
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,820
It's close. About five minutes by car.

646
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,000
It's close.

647
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,890
Do you want one?

648
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,960
What is it?

649
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,010
Just candy.

650
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,540
I'll get going.

651
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,630
It's mint flavored. But why give me candy out of the blue?

652
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,620
Tongue cell, what are you doing?

653
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,210
I'm showering with candy. Ba Bi gave it to me.

654
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,170
I see. Did he give it to us because the cake from earlier was rich?

655
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,350
Yes. As usual, he's kind.

656
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,430
All right. How far did we go last time?

657
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,170
Up to Chapter 2: Holding Hands.

658
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,310
Then, today we are going over chapter 3.

659
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:21,220
Chapter 3: Kiss.

660
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:29,870
K I S S.

661
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,290
Kiss.

662
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,260
You're in your boyfriend's car and he gives you a mint candy.

663
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,510
What does this mean?

664
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,050
- It means "Let's kiss!"
- What?

665
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,340
That's what it meant? I didn't know.

666
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,180
Calm down.

667
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,660
We've passed the age to make a fuss about this now.

668
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,120
I mean it's too fast though.

669
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,100
This seems too fast. I mean... I couldn't even have imagined this–

670
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,590
I don't think that's it.

671
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,050
Ba Bi is a gentleman. It's only been a week since they started dating.

672
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,510
Exactly.

673
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,220
Is Ba Bi not a man? These guys!

674
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,350
- They had dinner, chewed gum, and drank coffee!
- That's right.

675
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,160
Then what does it mean when he gives her candy now?!

676
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:30,080
Then when this candy finishes melting...

677
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,110
He said we'd arrive in five minutes.

678
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,650
So hurry and melt it.

679
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,680
Hurry, hurry!

680
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,100
Faster! Melt it faster!

681
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,040
Faster! Faster! Faster!

682
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,100
Help me!

683
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,660
It doesn't melt well

684
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,520
It's really hard!

685
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,450
So frustrating! Give it to me!

686
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,000
What to do!

687
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,810
You prefer to chew candy.

688
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:10,020
You differ from me. I prefer to suck on it.

689
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,780
Love, can you come down for a bit?

690
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,920
I think everyone is overreacting. What do we do?

691
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,930
I've been watching.

692
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,950
Would Ba Bi really do that?

693
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:35,820
Ba Bi is a gentleman and has a calm and upright personality.

694
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,220
Who knows how Ba Bi feels?

695
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,990
I'm questioning if Ba Bi is really a gentleman, calm, and upright person.

696
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,790
- You're doubting it?
- Yes.

697
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,060
I'm still apprehensive.

698
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:53,310
If Ba Bi really likes Yumi and why he likes her.

699
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,680
It's possible that Ba Bi was lonely after breaking up with his ex

700
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,900
and chose Yumi.

701
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,720
It could have been impulsive, right?

702
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,090
Then what do we do?

703
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,360
We're here.

704
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,060
What?

705
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,660
Huh?

706
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,780
Are we getting out?

707
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,780
Are we not?

708
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,980
No, let's get out.

709
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:49,460
♫ Let's build a little house in front of the river ♫

710
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,000
Uh... H-hold on. Really?
♫ Let's raise our dreams over the mountain peak there ♫

711
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,130
♫ My dear ♫

712
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,220
What did I tell you?
♫ my dear ♫

713
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,300
Ba Bi is also a man, you idiots.

714
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,750
♫ Let's hide in our little house and kiss ♫

715
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:20,310
♫ I will build a fortress in your heart when you have nowhere to go ♫

716
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:25,920
♫ I will take it to you ♫

717
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:32,040
♫ and open your door ♫

718
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,880
♫ I will fill that boat ♫

719
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:44,870
♫ with luggage ♫

720
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,960
♫ It will carry our love ♫

721
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:58,210
♫  as the sun sets ♫

722
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:03,420
♫ Even in the end your tears ♫

723
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,120
That was fast. I never imagined that
♫ will be forgotten in the wind ♫

724
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,900
Ba Bi would open the wormhole this fast.

725
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,460
This actually works out.

726
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,210
I'm glad I got this opportunity so quickly.

727
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,950
Love, where are you going?

728
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,720
I'm going to Ba Bi's village.

729
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,310
I need to see for myself what kind of person he is.

730
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,940
If he's a total jerk then it's better to get it together and end it quickly.

731
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,210
Love! Be careful!

732
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,360
Love, have a good trip!

733
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,000
Love is right.

734
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,380
A man who doesn't hesitate and has no self-control.

735
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,800
Ba Bi does seem like a really amazing guy but he also seems really dangerous.

736
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,530
What kind of world is Ba Bi's world?

737
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,020
Worst-case scenario he might be a sociopath.

738
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,790
Or it could be a terrible perverted world.

739
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,190
What is that?

740
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,800
What's that?

741
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,500
Hi, Yumi's Love cell.

742
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,320
Hi...

743
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,830
Hi, I'm Ba Bi's Reason cell.

744
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,380
Hi, I'm Ba Bi's Sensitivity cell.

745
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:08,450
Hi, I'm Ba Bi's Love cell.

746
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,840
We really wanted to meet you!

747
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,120
What is this...?

748
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,560
While we were waiting for you we prepared a welcome song. Do you want to hear it?

749
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,170
One, two, three.

759
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,840
It was a big surprise.

760
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,270
Ba Bi's world was neither gentle nor calm.

761
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:12,060
There was no artificial intelligence cell or algorithm. A totally new world.

762
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,510
We arrived in a new world

763
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,180
overflowing with roses, guitars, and romance.

764

Preview

790
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,960
Hi! Left. Right.

791
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,510
Do you want to come to my place too?

792
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:02,110
You should be brave. With your skills, I'm sure you would have won something.

793
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:02,840
Really?

794
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,400
You might have become Writer Yumi.

795
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,420
That's crazy. I'm against it! I oppose.

796
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,970
What do you think about sending Writer back to the grave first?

797
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,310
This is unfair.

798
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,920
It's too late to have a dream.

799
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,880
Really?

800
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,480
I want to try writing a novel.

801
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,370
That's a relief.

802
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,370
♫ You were heaven ♫
