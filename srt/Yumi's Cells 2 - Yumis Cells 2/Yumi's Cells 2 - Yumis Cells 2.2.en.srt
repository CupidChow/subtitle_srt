1
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,860
Ba Bi

2
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,090
Yumi's Cells 2

3
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,940
What am I?

4
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,370
Episode 04: What am I?

5
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,060
Then, can you tell me what I am feeling right now?

6
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,380
No.

7
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,640
But I want to know.

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,040
You're someone whom I always want to get to know.

9
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,410
That's why I want to be with you.

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,610
I see.

11
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,180
Hold on. Time out!

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,290
Did Yu Ba Bi just say this: That's why I want to be with you.?

13
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,170
What does this mean? They're with each other right now. Does it mean he wants to meet again?

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,250
Does it perhaps mean he is attracted to her?

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,980
No way!

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,970
Detective, what do you think this means?

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,620
It does sound like he is interested in her,

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,210
but it isn't even a question and it's ambiguous to answer.

19
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,940
Talking ambiguously is Yu Ba Bi's trait. That's what makes him attractive.

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,980
This isn't something to just move on from. Check it again!

21
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,820
Pardon?

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,170
What do you mean by that?

23
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,990
I'm saying that we should date.

24
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,730
We should date?

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
Did I just hear that right?

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,110
Yes, yes.

27
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,080
He just said they should date. He wants to date!

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,170
- Yay!
- Wait a moment.

29
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,550
- Don't get excited.
- What the heck?

30
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,250
Analyze it quickly, what does this mean?

31
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,210
To date. "Let's date"?

32
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,270
Well, maybe, does he mean he wants to get closer and have a deep friendship?

33
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,490
Ah, it's like that? If it's that—

34
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,230
Hey! What nonsense are you saying now?!

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,980
Let's date. Date, you idiots!

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,910
Lovey dovey dating!

37
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,980
- Dating?
- That's right! He just confessed his feelings for her!

38
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,390
This is frustrating! Why are you acting weird, as if you're dating for the first time?

39
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,270
We've dated before, but it's the first time we got a confession.

40
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,730
♫ I'll always be where you are, yeah yeah yeah ♫

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,300
♫  yeah yeah yeah ♫

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,590
♫ Anywhere you go,  ♫

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,520
♫ I can feel you even when I close my eyes ♫

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,800
So this is how it feels to get a confession.

45
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,310
Director, we're in trouble!

46
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,180
What's wrong?

47
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,730
Take a look. Yumi's self-esteem is skyrocketing.

48
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,160
It's unusual.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,390
It's a big problem. What do we do?

50
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,840
What's the problem? This is a good thing.

51
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,500
- Her self-esteem is rising because she got a confession.
- What?

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,530
It was rock bottom after we got rejected by Wung. This is good.

53
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,100
Abnormality

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,670
If we go this way,

55
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,010
the after-effects of breakup can also be cured immediately.

56
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,270
What? You want us to accept Ba Bi's confession?

57
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,790
For now, results show that it will be very helpful for her health.

58
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,340
We can't date for health, though.

59
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,760
We have never thought of Ba Bi as a potential partner either.

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,150
It's ridiculous to cure an illness caused by dating

61
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,260
- by dating again—
- It's okay! It's okay!

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,020
That's okay. Yumi's single right now.

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,190
They said it's also good for her health. Why are you hesitating?

64
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,330
Is your whole club crazy? What is okay?

65
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,640
Let's agree to date him. Everyone likes the idea of it.

66
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,820
Stop. Stop.

67
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,420
Dating is Love's jurisdiction. We can't make the decision among us.

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,960
Wait!

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,040
Love!

70
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,170
- Love hasn't waken up?
- Nope.

71
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,100
She's still in a coma? Then...

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,250
It's okay! It's okay!

73
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,000
It's okay! It's okay!

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,200
- It's okay! It's okay!
- Guys!

75
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,280
Did you ask Love?

76
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,010
Guys, listen carefully. We reject Yu Ba Bi's confession.

77
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,330
- Why?
- But why?

78
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,470
Why?

79
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,930
Love hasn't woken up yet.

80
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,250
- Love not waking up yet means that the feelings we have towards Ba Bi aren't love.
- They aren't?

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,310
Wake her up. Shake her and wake her like this.

82
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,030
Love is still in coma. She's far from recovery.

83
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,120
We can't start dating someone just because of the after-effects of a breakup.

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,590
We can't do anything without Love's permission.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
What do you think?

86
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,820
- What?
- What about you, Assistant Manager Yumi?

87
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,970
There. Politely rejecting—

88
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,510
- Why?
- Why?!

89
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,640
- Why?
- I like Ba Bi!

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,440
Guys. Just ignore him. Ignore him. Ignore.

91
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,170
What is it?

92
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,890
- Oh my god!
- Now what?

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,830
Why are you doing this to me?

94
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,010
Why me?

95
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,620
I will deal with those of you who don't think of Yumi and act like wild fans, strictly according to the rules.

96
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,290
What?

97
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,340
Are you going to ignore me again this time?

98
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,480
Assistant Manager Ba Bi, I ...

99
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,220
I am sorry.

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,000
♫ You're almost within my reach  ♫

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,750
Yes, you did well. You did good.

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,300
♫ when you melt in a teacup ♫

103
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,190

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,990
♫ A lovely smile ♫

105
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,360
I feel sorry for Assistant Manager Ba Bi. He's a very good person.

106
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,840
Ba Bi said there is someone at work whose name contains the alphabet "U" whom he's interested in.
RUBY

107
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,000
Alphabet "U".

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,710
U
♫ Don't hide anymore ♫

109
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,380
RUBY

110
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,820
♫ the light hidden in a corner of your heart ♫

111
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,470
I never thought that the alphabet "U"

112
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,330
was not Ruby.  R- U- B- Y → Y - U - M -I

113
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,840
♫I would like the whispers of love to become the raindrops knocking on the window ♫

114

♫ Holding you with my breath full ♫

116
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,920
I feel sorry for no reason.

117
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,500
♫ In the evening I want to walk under the Milky Way  ♫

118
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,240
Chief, her self-esteem is soaring again in the middle of the night!

119
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,020
Should we send a gift to Ba Bi or something?

120
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,970
I'm very grateful to him.
YM TODAY

121
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,220
But will she be okay? The number just went over 800.

122
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,760
Director of Headquarters

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,150
What? It's above 800?

124
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,220
YMH Yumi's Healthcare

125
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,990
- This is a bit dangerous.
- Then...

126
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,270
- Hello.
- Good morning.

127
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,940
Assistant Manager Ba Bi, these are the documents for the meeting.

128
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,510
- Ah, the ones I asked for yesterday?
- Yes.

129
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,060
Sensitivity: It's Ba Bi. Ba Bi!

130
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,050
Fashion: Our poor Ba Bi.

131
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,930
Guard: I think Oppa looks gaunt.

132
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,920
Reason: Be quiet, it's the first time they're seeing each other after that day, so he must feel awkward too.

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,510
So, let's greet him first, as if nothing happened.

134
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,150
Assistant Manager Ba Bi, did you have a good weekend?

135
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,120
- You came early.
- You've arrived?

136
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,890
Yes, I—

137
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,820
Sensitivity: What was that? Wasn't that very cold?

138
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,550
Face Wash Up: Maybe it's because of that day.

139
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,910
Guard: Right. It's probably because Yumi rejected him.

140
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,400
Peace Keeper: No way.

141
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,880
It's not that Yu Ba Bi acted cold,

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,730
I feel that it was Yumi who was cold.

143
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,380
Now repeat after me. "That's right. It was always like that."

144
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,850
That's right. It was always like that.

145
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,730
It was always like that.

146
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,770
It was always like that.

147
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,300
That's right. It was always like that.

148
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,590
- You've arrived?
- You've arrived?

149
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,250
"You're here early". He always said that.

150
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,900
Yu Ba Bi doesn't like long greetings.

151
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,460
Good morning, Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

152
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,480
Good morning. But something is different about you.

153
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,530
Try guessing what changed.

154
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,010
Your hair. Your hair changed.

155
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,120
Of course! You got it right, BB. I got it colored.

156
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,860
No wonder, I thought you looked bright.

157
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,650
Really? If I get any brighter, that could be a problem.

158
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,840
He doesn't like long greetings?! Yeah right, he is talking a lot.

159
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,930
He is talking a lot.

160
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,650
- Assistant Manager Yu.
- Yes?

161
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,370
You know the meeting for Julie's planning has changed to this afternoon, right?

162
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,520
Yes, I prepared the material for it.

163
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,590
You don't need me to go, right?

164
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,750
Or you can go with Assistant Manager Yumi.

165
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,140
No, I will go with Miss Bon Hui. She was in charge of this originally so she'd know it well.

166
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,450
All right then.

167
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,280
So the response ...

168
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,100
See! The Director said he should go with Yumi, so why is he going with Bon Hui?!

169
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,550
Please sit. He said Bon Hui was originally in charge.

170
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,050
That's not it. I think Ba Bi is upset.

171
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm sure! He's hurt because of what happened that day.

172
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,430
He's hurt and upset because Yumi rejected him.

173
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,140
Is that possible? You're just sick right now.

174
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,830
How am I sick?!

175
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,390
You become sick when your self-esteem level goes above 800.

176
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,570
Yumi has now recovered from the after-effects of the breakup thanks to Ba Bi

177
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,610
but she seems to have a different illness.

178
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,320
If it's a different illness, then what...

179
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,160
Princess syndrome.

180
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,690
I didn't think he would be hurt because of me.

181
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,770
What can I do if he's that hurt?

182
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,010
This kind of thing is so hard for me.

183
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,590
Assistant Manager Ba Bi, I'll help you. I'll carry it with you.

184
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,780
No. It's not heavy. It's okay.

185
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,750
No, I...

186
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,050
See! He's upset. He's hurt because of Yumi.

187
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,740
Stop talking nonsense and please sit.

188
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,630
Yumi ruined a man's life!

189
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,830
Our Yu Ba Bi! He'll never be able to date again!

190
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,990
What are you going to do if he gets old and dies of sadness?

191
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,230
You're seriously so dramatic.

192
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,060
Hi, Bon Hui.

193
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,420
Didn't you leave yet?

194
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,450
Yes. Are you just coming back from the meeting?

195
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,600
Yes. The meeting was longer than expected.

196
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,040
That must have been tough.

197
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,700
What about Assistant Manager Ba Bi?

198
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,020
He went home right after the meeting. I came back because I left something here.

199
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,940
Really? I'm just asking because we're neighbors and take the same route.

200
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,620
I see.

201
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,640
- Bon Hui, goodbye.
- See you tomorrow.

202
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,670
♫ Today too, my day ♫

203
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,780
♫ approaches me slowly ♫

204
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,060
He must be really hurt. It took a lot for him to tell me how he feels.

205
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,940
♫ I unexpectedly joked around like I used ♫

206
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,270
♫ Why did it have to be this morning? ♫

207
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,760
What's so special about Kim Yumi?

208
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,520
Having feelings for someone like me and getting hurt.

209
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,730
What a dummy.

210
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,040
Should I at least ask him to grab a beer to make him feel better?

211
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,330
♫ It's not about something I can understand ♫

212
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,890
♫ To me who spent a day unexpectedly ♫

213
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,020
No. What if that gives him hope?

214
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,340
I don't have any feelings for him.

215
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,640
♫ love love love ♫

216
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,910
♫ Can't think of the word that I want to say ♫

217
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,490
Time will make him feel better.

218
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,800
♫ Sing me a song, song, song, song ♫

219
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,160
♫ So that I can feel your love, love, love ♫

220
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,970
Ba Bi seems to have a hard time being around Yumi.

221
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,120
Of course. He got rejected by a woman he liked.

222
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,520
Of course, he's sad. Poor Ba Bi!

223
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,500
Ba Bi! Don't be hurt!

224
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,080
Let's pretend not to notice him tomorrow.

225
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,140
Until Ba Bi feels better.

226
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,690
♫ I want someone to live around my heart ♫

227
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,180
Oh no! I'm late! I'm late!

228
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,920
Oh no!

229
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,860
What should I do?

230
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,070
She missed her alarm. Oh dear!

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,150
She was tossing and turning because of Ba Bi.

232
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,790
It's Yu Ba Bi.

233
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,350
He's with some woman.

234
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,980
This early in the morning?

235
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,840
I know that face.

236
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,370
Ba Bi, I just got here.

237
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,800
All right.

238
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,770
I'll wait for you. Take your time.
- It's Ba Bi's ex-girlfriend!

239
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,290
What? What happened?

240
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,660
Why are they together? They broke up!

241
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,270
Over the weekend they must have started dating again.

242
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,360
I get it now. He wasn't avoiding Yumi because he was hurt.

243
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,520
He felt apologetic toward Yumi.

244
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,550
Yumi doesn't mean anything to him anymore

245
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,890
because his beloved ex-girlfriend came back.

246
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,520
- Does that make sense?
- They're back together? They broke up so long ago.

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,290
Maybe she just came to talk?

248
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,100
First thing in the morning? Are you saying that she came looking for him all the way here, when it's time to go to work?

249
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,030
No.

250
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,760
Look there!

251
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,630
No make up. Messy hair.

252
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,450
Based on those two clues,

253
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,560
it's highly unlikely she got ready for work at home and came back here.

254
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,750
If that's true...

255
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,980
- It's more likely that she spent the night at Ba Bi's.
- Oh my god!

256
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,190
Oppa...

257
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,700
Why?

258
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,390
I knew this would happen.

259
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,850
Episode 05: Fan & Anti-Fan

260
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:51,170
Whatever. It's better this way. I don't need to feel bad anymore.

261
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Good for him.

262
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,660
Okay, Yu Ba Bi club members. You understand the situation now, right?

263
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,380
Our Oppa Ba Bi, got back together with his ex two days after Yumi rejected him.

264
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,270
This is what happens when you can't tell if you like someone or are a fan of them.

265
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:27,050
You all and Ba Bi mistook your loneliness for love.

266
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,130
We're done being confused!

267
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,810
Oppa Ba Bi went back to his girlfriend whom he loves.

268
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,200
Now all of you must get it together

269
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
and go home!

270
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,510
It should be calmer now.

271
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,900
I won't let Yu Ba Bi off the hook.

272
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,230
What is this! Wow, I'm getting pissed off.

273
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,380
Yu Ba Bi, are you playing with me right now?

274
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,540
Don't bother. Yumi rejected him anyway.

275
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,090
It's not our business anymore.

276
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,490
He was just sending up a trial balloon while waiting for his ex-girlfriend to contact him.

277
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,050
How can they get back together after two days?

278
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,790
Do you have a conscience?

279
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,960
I said not to bother with it. It's not our business anymore.

280
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,250
Yea, that's right. It was burdensome anyway.

281
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,810
It worked out. It worked out really well.

282
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,750
- Good morning, Manager.
- Good morning.

283
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,160
Good morning.

284
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,600
Han Byeol, did you pass the revision along yesterday?

285
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,690
I think Assistant Manager Kim probably passed that along.

286
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,030
Ah. Okay.

287
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,980
- Assistant Manager Yumi.
- Yes?

288
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,760
- Did you pass along the revision yesterday?
- Yes.

289
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,960
I couldn't confirm it. Around what time did you submit it?

290
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,040
At around 8?

291
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,100
I see.

292
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,290
Ba Bi. Ba Bi.

293
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,660
Look, there's another typo.

294
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,410
Hm?

295
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,840
What are they doing?

296
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,220
Guys, what are you doing?

297
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,050
We got caught.
I HATE BABI

298
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,940
- Run!
- Hey, stop! You made it all messy here.

299
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,480
- Come... quickly.

300
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,960
Isn't that Sensitivity?

301
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,910
What is this?
I HATE BA BI

302
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,770
Stupid Ba Bi. Poop Ba Bi?

303
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,870
They seemed to all be members of the Yu Ba Bi club.

304
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,900
The fans turned into anti-fans.

305
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,290
Ruby

306
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,700
Hello?

307
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,590
Eonni, where are you? Did you get off work?

308
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,690
I just left.

309
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,470
- If you haven't gotten on a bus yet, come join us.
- Where?

310
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,270
It's raining, what do you think about a glass of beer?

311
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,790
- Eonni Yi Da is here too.
- Yumi, come quickly.

312
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,790
Yay! Beer is great. Beer, beer!

313
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,520
Where are you?

314
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,370
Yumi, over here.

315
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,910
What a coincidence, I was going to have a glass today—

316
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,770
I'm here too.

317
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,760
On our way we ran into Assistant Manager Yu out front.

318
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,910
Ruby dragged him here.

319
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,370
Yes. I was dragged here.

320
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,800
Assistant Manager Ba Bi said he'd treat us today. Let's have something delicious!

321
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,810
Please sit.

322
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,740
Sit, sit.

323
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,090
I'm so annoyed.

324
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,420
You should just go on a date! Why are you here too?!

325
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,020
I guess he's lonely because he doesn't have a date today.

326
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,170
Why? This time is he planning on asking Ruby or Yi Da out today?

327
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,550
Stop it, you guys. It doesn't matter anymore, how long are you going to be like this?

328
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,230
They're coworkers. Are you going to continue to be angry every time you see him?

329
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,820
Exactly. So why did he have to confess to a coworker

330
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,150
and make someone uncomfortable?

331
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,580
This won't do.

332
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,290
Hunger!

333
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,420
Did you call me?

334
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,620
You're going to have to do some work. It's important for Yumi to be normal and stop worrying about Ba Bi.

335
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,370
I'm confident in that.

336
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,780
What should we order?

337
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,820
- Since we're going to drink beer, should we order some fries?
- Sounds good.

338
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,940
-The fire wings here are good.
-Really?

339
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,750
- Then we'll order the fire wings too.
- Okay.

340
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,600
- No! You can't order that like that.
- An order of fire wings.

341
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,850
You can't order fire wings.

342
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,840
Yi Da, can you pass me the menu for a sec?

343
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,530
Yes, sure. Do you want to order?

344
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,620
There are too many options, I don't know what to order.

345
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,540
Just a minute, please.

346
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,650
It's important to look at the big picture when ordering the food.

347
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,570
If you order like that, it ruins the balance of the food.

348
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,880
That's right. You draw the big picture.

349
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,830
Detective and Stingy, help me!

350
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,180
Okay!

351
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,710
From now on, stay on your toes.

352
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,800
Ordering food to go with the drinks is finding the hidden riddle in the menu.

353
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,090
It's clear that the answer is always in the menu.

354
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,530
- Yumi, did you pick?
- One second.

355
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,900
She is an ordering specialist.

356
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,820
- Really?
- It's no joke.

357
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,280
Take your time with the menu, and let me know when you've decided.

358
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,190
Just a second.

359
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,710
- I'll order.
- What would you like to order?

360
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,000
Cancel the fries and fire wings, and give us the grilled cheese lobster set please.

361
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,770
- What?
- Why are you ordering like that?

362
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,680
The lobster set includes fries and fire wings.

363
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,560
There's no need to order it separately.

364
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,040
Okay. The lobster set...

365
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,410
Wait, we're allowed to change the side options right?

366
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,740
Did you not want the fries and fire wings for the sides?

367
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,530
No, swap the fries with the addictive corn please.

368
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,920
Why? I want to eat fries.

369
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,340
Also swap the fire wings for salad.

370
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,370
- The fire wings too?
- Fire wings ...

371
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,460
Okay. The corn and salad as sides—

372
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,410
Now, I order the fries again.

373
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,190
Free Delivery /Celebrating Our Opening
Fries Coupon

374
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,490
- Oh, this ...
- It's a fries coupon, right?

375
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:26,290
I got it from the office flyers. I was preparing for moments like this.

376
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,400
As expected of you.

377
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,530
When do you use coupons? Knowing the timing is important.

378
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,090
You had this?

379
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,590
So, the fries are handled. Now we'll order five bottles of Julie beer.

380
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,760
Is this right? We get five pieces of fire wings for free when we order five bottles of Julie beer.

381
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,060
Just like that, we handled the fire wings too.

382
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,810
Oh my gosh. You solved everything with one appetizer.

383
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,040
It's not over yet.

384
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,780
Yes, so the lobster set with corn and salad as sides.

385
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,590
Five bottles of Julie beer and fire wings, and fries for free.

386
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,210
Is that all?

387
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,820
Yes.

388
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,430
But, it's raining outside.

389
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:35,350
I saw it. In the corner of the menu, written in 6pt font.

390
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,940
On rainy days, all tables will be given one sheet of king size fish jerky for free.

391
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,120
- There was something like this?
- On rainy days, we give king size fish jerky for free.

392
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,330
King size fish jerky? Wow!

393
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,430
Thank you.

394
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,910
Wow, Hunger, as expected you're amazing.

395
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:01,350
You're the only cell that stays faithful to its purpose without getting swayed by emotions!

396
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,000
It is my ironclad rule to always do my best.

397
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,390
Cheers!

398
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,950
I'm telling you, Kim Yumi is the best for ordering.

399
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,900
Did you see? The ordering specialist.

400
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,920
You're amazing.

401
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,450
Well, it's nothing.

402
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,410
- Assistant Manager Ba Bi.
- Yes?

403
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,250
- Why don't you go on blind dates?
- What?

404
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:37,590
I wanted to introduce him to some people, so I recommended a couple of my friends. But he didn't want to meet any of them.

405
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,520
I really recommended them with your interest in mind.

406
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,490
- I don't like blind dates.
- You don't have a girlfriend.

407
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,960
He must have someone. Someone you're flirting with.

408
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,190
Is there someone?

409
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,620
There was.

410
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,070
- There was, but I was rejected.
- Really?

411
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,760
Who dared to reject our Assistant Manager Ba BI?

412
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,810
That woman must have a heart of steel.

413
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:22,660
I don't know who it is, but she really doesn't have an eye for men. What was the reason?

414
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,060
Hm?

415
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,790
I'm not sure.

416
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,360
- What?
- She just rejected you?

417
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,730
Is he saying that now for Yumi to hear?

418
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,870
Isn't he just answering truthfully because they asked?

419
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,670
Is he acting as if he's the victim? That hypocrite.

420
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,540
Wow, I'm really full.

421
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,180
- I ate too much.
- Right? Thank you for dinner.

422
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,550
The rain stopped during that time. We almost didn't get to eat the king sized fish jerky.

423
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,130
- You're right. The timing was perfect.
- You're right.

424
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,860
You're all taking the bus, right? Ruby is going to take the subway.

425
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,290
Thank you for dinner, BB! I'm going, Eonni.

426
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,700
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

427
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,630
Let's go too. Let's go.

428
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,920
- Miss Yi Da, which line are you taking?
- Number 385.

429
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,300
Your bus will get here before ours.

430
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,550
It might be uncomfortable riding the bus together, should we take the taxi?

431
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,950
The fare for a taxi ride from here is so expensive!

432
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,990
If you ride a taxi alone in front of Yi Da, it might seem more obvious.

433
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,830
After Yi Da leaves, let's take the taxi.

434
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,410
In a moment, the bus will arrive.

435
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, Yumi. Your bus is arriving first.

436
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,080
Ours came first.

437
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,720
Thank you for dinner tonight.

438
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

439
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,160
Yun's Department Store Station

440
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you not getting on?

441
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,750
This seat is empty.

442
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,040
You should sit here.

443
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,590
No, it's okay.

444
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,160
You should sit.

445
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,530
It's awkward. I feel awkward and annoyed.

446
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,270
I want to go back to before the confession. What kind of situation is this?

447
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,800
And there's still ten bus stops left. I'm going to go crazy!

448
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,080
It might be because of the rain, but it's quite chilly.

449
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,210
It's fall again.

450
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,420
Assistant Manager Yumi, I'll get off at this stop.

451
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,810
- What?
- I think I'm making you feel uncomfortable.

452
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,800
I'll take the next bus home.

453
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,740
No, I didn't say anything like that.

454
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,410
♫ Let's raise our dreams over the mountain peak there ♫

455

What is he doing right now?

460
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:28,140
Who said we felt uncomfortable? It's him that feels that way and he's using Yumi as an excuse.

461
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,660
What was that? So annoying.
♫ I will build a fortress in your heart ♫

Assistant Manager Kim Yumi: Isn't it you and not me that feels uncomfortable?

474
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,090
Me?

475
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,480
You feel sorry seeing me.

476
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,090
Why would I feel sorry?

477
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,140
I'm the one who was rejected.

478

♫ Even in the end your tears ♫

479

480
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,100
- Hello? 
- Assistant Manager Yumi.

481
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,740
That's a misunderstanding.

482
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,260
No, it's a misunderstanding.

483
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,090
That person drank in the early morning and came to my house.

484
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,390
I think you saw me when I was sending her away and I told her not to contact me again.

485
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,670
Can you wait for me?

486
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,840
- What?
-  Wait for me, if you're not uncomfortable with me.

487
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,960
I don't feel uncomfortable either.

488
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,160
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

489
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,650
I'm not even in a relationship with you, so I don't need to know about your personal life.

490
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:52,130
I just felt like what the words you use with me are always too carefully chosen, so I felt angry.

491
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,040
I'm so glad.

492
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
I'm so glad,

493
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,640
that you waited for me.

Episode 6
Situation Reversal
♫ as the sun sets ♫

498
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,010
Was it in high school?

499
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,920
I went to the movies with my friends.

500
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,480
I felt like I wasted my money.

501
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,090
It was super boring, so much so that I don't even remember the name of the movie.

502
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:46,220
But I happened to go to the library and read the original work on which the movie was based.

503
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,480
That's when I started to get close to books.

504
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,200
There's a world that only books can show you.

505
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,690
That day, we talked at an unfamiliar bus stop

506
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,930
and around the time the next bus was coming, Assistant Manager Ba Bi said these words."

507
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,080
I hope the bus doesn't come.

508
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,900
Those words.

509
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,260
When I was with someone I liked, those were words I often thought of.

510
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,430
However, I didn't have the courage to actually say those words aloud.

511
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,750
Yu Ba Bi is incredible.

512
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,520
The bus will arrive soon.

513
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,600
It came.

514
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:59,450
I knew how hard it is to say those words, so they kept circling in my mind.

515
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
Love, answer!

516
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,550
Accept Yu Ba Bi!

517
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,740
Accept Yu Ba Bi!

518
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,240
Yumi's future boyfriend is Yu Ba Bi!

519
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,830
Don't hesitate!

520
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,150
Don't hesitate!

521
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,570
The Ba Bi club members, urge Love to

522
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,170
accept Ba Bi's sincerity!

523
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,820
Accept it! Accept it!

524
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,980
- Accept Ba Bi!
- Accept him!

525
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,900
- Accept Ba Bi!
- Accept him!

526
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,130
Love! You woke up! You're okay now, right?

527
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,130
Yes. Did you see, those guys?

528
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,930
- Accept Ba Bi!
- Accept him!

529
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,920
Don't worry about the Ba Bi fans. While you weren't around you really couldn't describe their behavior.

530
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,450
Don't tell me you also...

531
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,280
That's not it.

532
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,750
I think it'll take some time for me to recover.

533
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,420
Right? Love, you need to rest. Yumi needs to rest.

534
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,860
What you're saying is right.

535
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,260
But I do think Yu Ba Bi is incredible.

536
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,600
I've never been straightforward as he has.

537
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,370
- We also need to hurry up and throw the breakup card.
- Hurry up and throw the breakup card.

538
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,320
I waited until the last moment when we broke up with Wung

539
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,190
to decide after seeing what Wung was going to do.

540
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,410
I think we should end it here.

541
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,090
Breakup - end the relationship

542
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,050
Daehan Noodles

543
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,260
But it seems amazing to be able to express how you feel

544
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,220
even when you were rejected

545
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,480
Good morning, Assistant Manager Kim.

546
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,880
Oh, yes. Good morning.

547
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,630
Good morning.

548
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,610
How did the two of you come together?

549
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,410
We met each other when we were getting coffee. We're absolutely not close.

550
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,360
Even if you don't emphasize it, everyone knows we're not close.

551
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,930
Really?

552
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,710
- Let's head in.
- Ah, yes.

553
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,340
Thank you.

554
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,020
- Miss Bon Hui.
- Yes?

555
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,710
- This needs to be printed.
- Ah yes, give it to me.

556
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,940
- Thank you.
- Sure.

557
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,410
- Ba Bi.
- Yes.
- Take a look.

558
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,970
- I asked the chief and he said it was you who made the typo, not me.
- Oh, really?

559
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,540
- You asked the Director about this.
- Of course, I did.

560
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,220
- Is that what she said?
- Of course.

561
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,360
I'm usually good at reporting.

562
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,450
She said you were the one who made the typo.

563
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,250
I was so surprised.

564
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,340
On the typos...

565
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,320
- What is this?
- It looks like the hearts of Ba Bi's fans?

566
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,480
Seriously? I said to stop doing things like this!

567
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,790
- It's not us.
- It wasn't us.

568
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,010
If it's not you, who would do this?

569
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,750
Other cells seem to have feelings for Ba Bi now.

570
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,200
Right? Let's go.

571
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,800
She already rejected him, so forget about him now!

572
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,350
Get rid of this stuff right away.

573
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,010
The faster you get rid of it the less damage it will do.

574
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:01,100
We can get rid of feelings if they are still in small amounts.

575
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,070
Although, sometimes feelings return even if we threw them away.

576
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,840
Which department are you going to?

577
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,590
We call those feelings regrets.

578
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,040
Aren't you going to another department?

579
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,580
Sorry?

580
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,290
Aren't you getting in?

581
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:56,770
I... Please go ahead. I forgot something.

582
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,250
What am I doing right now?

583
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,840
Daehan Noodles

584
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,970
You were going to the same floor? The sales department?

585
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,350
Yes. Sales department.

586
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,940
Reason! Look at this!

587
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,010
I picked this out of the trash again!

588
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,450
Stop collecting them!

589
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,660
- Assistant Manager Yumi.
- Yes?

590
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,600
Aren't you going to have lunch?

591
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,790
Please go ahead. I still have some more work to do.

592
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,180
You should eat first.

593
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,400
No I'm okay. Please go ahead.

594
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,770
Assistant Manager Yumi.

595
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,450
Yes?

596
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,850
Do I still make you uncomfortable?

597
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,510
No.

598
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,790
You don't need to feel uncomfortable.

599
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,290
Of course. What do you mean?

600
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,570
Why would I? I'm not at all.

601
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,370
We're friends, right?

602
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,390
Sorry?

603
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,190
I thought you might not even want to be friends.

604
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,950
That's not it, right?

605
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,550
It's not.

606
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,650
I really do still have some work to do.

607
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,050
Okay.

608
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,480
Enjoy your lunch.

609
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,100
Let's go.

610
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,450
What about Assistant Manager Yumi?

611
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,400
She's not coming.

612
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,810
What are we eating?

613
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,190
- Did you finish?
- Yeah

614
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,960
- Kalguksu*?
- Kalguksu.
 (knife-cut noodles)

615
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,600
A person's emotions are so strange.

616
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,450
What makes me interested after I rejected him?

617
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,160
I saw it on my way back.

618
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,640
We will start the new product marketing plan for the 2021 Q2.
Marketing Plan for 2021 Q2

619
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,500
Please look at the screen.

620
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,140
It's become wheat noodles. I came up with the name.

621
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,170
Suddenly I started noticing things I didn't before.

622
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,450
Pasta, Rose Pasta, or Jjangmyeon*, for example.
(black bean noodles)

623
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,590
What habits he has.

624
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:19,120
How many buttons are undone.

625
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,690
Let's go to the next one. I came up with really good ideas for this.

626
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,410
Through discussion–

627
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,400
We added this.

628
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,340
I fixed it.

629
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,620
What kind of fragrance he likes.

630
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,760
The "Amazing Noodles" series...

631
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,940
Let's skip ahead of this proposal.

632
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,110
If you just go to the next page.

633
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,570
Even at how he looks at me.

634
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,790
0% Wheat

635
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,790
for dieting...

636
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,800
Good work.

637
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,170
You worked hard, too.

638
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,430
- Should we ask him to have dinner together?
- No.

639
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,070
Ba Bi would like that.

640
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,550
Don't let him think there's potential if you're not going to date him. That's common courtesy.

641
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,840
Isn't it common courtesy to buy him dinner if he got us a sandwich?

642
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,230
Yeah, he said we're friends.

643
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,570
What's the big deal with having dinner with a friend?

644
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,840
- I'm heading out first.
- Have a nice weekend.

645
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,340
Have a nice weekend. You too, Assistant Manager Yumi.

646
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,030
Uhh– Din–

647
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,770
Daehan Noodles

648
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,090
- Where do you think he's going?
- Don't mind him.

649
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,170
Probably not to his ex-girlfriend again, right?

650
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,720
He said it wasn't like that.

651
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,940
Moreover, you shouldn't care about whomever he meets. You already rejected him.

652
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,170
I don't want to get on the bus by myself.

653
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,130
You always got on by yourself.

654
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,920
No, with Ba Bi--

655
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,030
Stop talking about Ba Bi. You rejected him. That bus already left.

656
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,570
Ba Bi and I have the same taste in music.

657
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,550
And what about our taste in coffee.

658
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,190
Our taste in novels goes without saying!

659
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,560
Stop. Let's go exercise.

660
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,860
It's the miss from the upper floor!

661
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,410
Hello!

662
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:47,560
I guess you're out exercising. It's a bit cold, though.

663
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,360
Yes, I came out for the first time in awhile. It's been awhile since I ran.

664
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,840
Your subtleness is stylish.

665
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,320
Pardon?

666
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:02,560
Even your workout clothes are stylish.

667
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,010
Thank you.

668
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,690
Did you do an effortless look in the midst of all this?

669
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,720
I've been caught.

670
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,400
Why, because you thought you might meet Ba Bi at the park?

671
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,520
It's up to me!

672
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,450
Don't mess with the fans!

673
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:25,740
Reason: Why are Yumi's lips light pink? Did she put on makeup?

674
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,010
Face Wash: You never know if she might run into Ba Bi.

675
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,310
Emotion: But I don't see Ba Bi.

676
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:36,150
Fashion: He exercises in the morning on weekends. Why isn't he here?

677
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,040
You're being pathetic, Kim Yumi.

678
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,090
What's with you?

679
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,610
You just rejected him, so what are you doing now, geez.

680
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,740
Anyway, you are being thoughtless.

681
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,920
Since when did you suddenly have any interest in Yu Ba Bi?

682
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,500
Someone confesses to you once and now you are distracted.

683
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,690
That's what I want to say, Yumi.

684
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,330
Do you think now is the time to think about dating again?

685
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:20,440
Find your own day-to-day routine. Think about how you'll live your future.

686
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,740
That's what I'm saying.

687
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,610
Live every day diligently. Stop having these pointless delusions.

688
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,250
That's right! You're doing good!

689
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,870
The same goes for meals.

690
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:37,340
Have you eaten properly since Wung moved out?

691
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,870
Not at all!

692
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,890
Why should I live like that?

693
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,510
Should I plan a month's menu in advance?

694
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,510
Even if it's just one meal a day. Sure, let's do that.

695
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,490
I've been eating so carelessly these days.

696
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:08,550
I'll go home and meal plan...

697
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,310
Assistant Manager Yumi?

698
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,170
It's Ba Bi!

699
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,230
I ran into you here again.

700
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,110
It's Ba Bi. Ba Bi!

701
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:32,160
I can't believe we are running into him here again. This is fate.

702
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,570
Can't believe these guys. I told you to stop, seriously!

703
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:45,750
Dummy. Trying to control the floating Ba Bi hearts is not the way.

704
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,630
Dislike cell.

705
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:52,330
You don't throw away the heart. You break it. Didn't you know that?

706
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,710
You're supposed to break it?

707
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:57,350
You've never heard of a turnoff?

708
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,750
Are you going to eat curry?

709
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,450
Assistant Manager Ba Bi.

710
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:12,000
If Ba Bi has at least one thing that Yumi doesn't like, it can break the heart.

711
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,610
Looks like we're on the same page. I'm also planning to eat curry.

712
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,410
Is that curry good? I've never tried it before.

713
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:25,060
Yes, if you like traditional Indian food.

714
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,890
Should I try it too?

715
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,940
Indian Curry

716
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,660
Starting now, open all your senses and you have to find something you don't like.

717
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,690
Is the traditional Indian dish different? Is it hard to make?

718
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,250
It's the same.

719
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,310
What about other ingredients? Can I put it in the same ones?

720
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,100
If you have fresh cream that'll be good.

721
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,660
- Spider! Spider!
- Oh my!

722
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,450
What was that? He's that dramatic over one spider?

723
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,740
Did you hear that? "Oh my~"

724
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,430
Doesn't that totally turn you off?

725
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,870
♫ A room without space to take a step ♫

726
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,460
That scared me.

727
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,980
♫ An opening in the window is where I can take a breath ♫

728
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,580
Look at that scaredy-cat! I'm so turned off.

729
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,990
What do you think? Your Oppa Ba Bi is a total turnoff, right?

730
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,890
"Oh my~" I really don't like–

731
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,930
It's cute. Ba Bi is cute.

732
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,320
- He's adorable!
- Seriously!

733
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,490
He's even clumsy.

734
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,420
What's so cute about that?

735
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,970
♫ When it pours rain ♫

736
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,880
He is cute.

737
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,780
He's so cute.

738
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,740
♫ While I'm on my way to collect the heart I left behind ♫

739
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,170
I'm embarrassed. I hate bugs.

740
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:45,040
I hate them, too.

741
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,270
Ah, I see.

742
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,840
Where's the fresh cream?

743
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,480
Follow me.

744
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,510
♫ Holiday where through the leaves there is a small boat ♫

745
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:06,900
♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path ♫

746
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,420
I don't know if this will turn out well.

747
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,780
If it isn't working out, you can ask me for help.

748
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:21,050
It's raining. Oh no.

749
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,250
I have an umbrella.

750
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:27,460
- I thought it was going to rain so I brought it.
- I see.

751
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah, let's use it together.

752
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,710
Let's use it together!

753
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,620
Let's use it together.

754
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,080
No, it's okay. I'll just buy one. Go ahead.

755
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,630
For what? It'll be quick.

756
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,200
You can go after we go to my place, it's right up front.

757
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,700
Give it to me. It must be heavy.

758
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,690
It's okay.

759
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,220
You're going to get wet. Come this way more.

760
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,130
No, it's all right.

761
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:51,590
What's that? What's that sound?

762
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:57,580
Hey! What are you guys doing? Why are you hitting the drums?

763
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,330
What's wrong with this situation?

764
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:03,820
A neighbor doesn't have an umbrella, so we just shared it!

765
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,010
You guys are really ...!

766
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,300
- Here.
- Ah, yes. Thank you.

767
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,020
Take the umbrella.

768
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,680
Can I give it back to you at work?

769
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,950
Yes. Give it to me whenever you want. I have a lot of umbrellas.

770
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,720
Thank you.

771
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,230
Enjoy your lunch.

772
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,840
Thanks and try to make the curry well.

773
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,490
If it doesn't work, I'll send an SOS.

774
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,480
Please do.

775
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:06,800
Getting farther away from being turned off and falling for him is getting stronger and stronger.

776
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,380
Hello?

777
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,900
Eonni, are you at home?

778
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,260
Must be nice. I'm at work.

779
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,290
Eonni, our monthly hangout is scheduled for the 14th

780
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,520
because all the eonnis said that's the only day they're free. You're in, right?

781
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,580
Yes, that's good.

782
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,960
Okay, I will see you at work.

783
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,920
Ah, that's right. Did you hear about Assistant Manager Ba Bi?

784
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,980
What?

785
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,550
He's finally going to do it.

786
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,860
- What?
- Go on a blind date with my friend.

787
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,880
It's next Saturday.

788
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,430
What are you talking about? He said he wouldn't go on blind dates.

789
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:51,930
But he's doing it. I ran into him in the hallway the other day and he said he'd do it.

790
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,420
So I scheduled it quickly before he changed his mind.

791
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,910
I sent him a picture of my friend, just in case.

792
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,360
I think that's why he changed his mind.

793
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,590
I think it'll surely work out well.

794
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:08,180
The two of them are good-looking, Ruby has a feeling this will be 100% successful.

795
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:18,380
Ah, I see.

796
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,270
Okay, I got it.

797
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,230
Yes. See you tomorrow.

798
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,870
Why–

799
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,750
The bags were mixed up.

800
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,000
Ah, I see.

801
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,950
I thought I would have to call you to come out but luckily you didn't go in yet.

802
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,110
I got a call from Ruby.

803
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,790
♫ Cause you are my star ♫

804
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:44,820
- Ruby?
- Yes.

805
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,910
By the way, are you going on a blind date?

806
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:59,630
Ruby just told me that you are going on a blind date.

807
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,410
Yes.

808
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,180
Yes, I said I'll go.

809
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,260
I see.

810
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,380
I'm going to get going.

811
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,020
Bye.

812
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,160
♫ I will become the moon just for you ♫

813
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,800
♫ So that you can breathe within me ♫

814
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,060
♫ Darkness and loneliness entirely will cease to exist ♫

815
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:50,490
♫ Cause you are my star ♫

816
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:55,620
♫ No matter what kind of night falls, I will shine on you/i> ♫

817
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:02,110
♫ So that you can fall asleep in the moonlight's warmth ♫

818
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:08,620
'Cause you are my star. 'Cause you are my life

819
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,810
♫ I'm just shining on your night ♫

820
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:17,130
♫ I will become the moon just for you ♫

821
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,260
♫ So that you can breathe within me ♫

822
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,420
Yumi's Cells 2
Preview

823
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,040
She's seriously the best among my friends. She's a pharmacist.

824
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,680
It's such a waste for such a good-looking guy to be single. I'm going to keep trying to fix him up.

825
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,080
That girl is useless.

826
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,240
Let's first find out how the blind date went.

827
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,200
I'm jealous, you punk.

828
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,420
Then is it really over?

829
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,440
Why, why, why, why not!

830
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,720
Sensitivity eventually exploded.

831
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,880
Run, Yumi!

832
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,790
What are you doing here?

833
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,960
I have something to tell you.

834
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,630
♫ Cause you are my life ♫

835
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,440
♫ I'll shining on your night ♫
