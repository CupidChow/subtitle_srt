Episode 30: Areas Ba Bi frequents.

3
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,530
First place* is mine!
(First to leave a comment.)

4
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,640
Oh yeah! First place! I'm in first place!

5
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,380
It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world! I can't wait for Monday!

6
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,390
What's going on?

7
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,150
The writer is a genius at the very least.

8
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,970
She's messing with the readers.

9
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,920
Amazing!

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Kim Yumi is the best!

11
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,690
Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript!

12
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,160
"My Love Muse is the best."

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,970
Writer Kim Yumi is the best!
1: Oh yeah! First place!/ 2: It's so interesting! The most interesting in the world!

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,050
Oh my, why are they like this?

15
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,440
♫ There's a me I don't know ♫

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,490
Hello?
Julie Publishing

17
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,030
Writer, did you see today's comments?

18
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,070
The reaction is no joke.

19
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,720
As it happens, I was taken aback because there are only compliments.

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Are you sure they weren't paid by the publisher?

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,110
What are you talking about? We don't do that sort of thing.

22
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,430
The reaction is good because it's interesting.

23
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,470
As I see it, your writing skill has improved a lot recently!

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,220
That's a relief, then.

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,770
Writer, fighting! Soon you'll be number 1 on the charts.

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,150
Oh, anticipating that kind of thing...

27
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,340
Have a good day.

28
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,320
I will, have a good day.

29
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,860
♫ There is a world ♫

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,940
What the heck ...

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,130
It must really be interesting.
♫  I don't know ♫

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
♫ It's running there far away ♫

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,470
Sir?
♫ It shouldn't run so fast ♫

What is it?

40
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,010
The files for this morning's meeting...

CEO Gu Wung

42
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,260
I'll leave them here.

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,700

44
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,000

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,700
♫ In the place love is ♫

47
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,970
These days, Wung's morning routine has changed.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,820
I can't believe that we're using Chief Concentration on something like this.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,730
Wung is enjoying it. How long has it been since he was this happily focused on something?

50
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,150
I got a feeling Writer Kim Yumi is probably pretty, too. Hehehe. - "WushaWusha"*
(A cheering sound)

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
You think Writer Kim Yumi's face would be pretty, too?

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,080
This person has a good instinct.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,500
How did they know that?

54
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,210
Yi Da

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,570
Hey, Yi Da. What's up, so early in the morning?

56
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,920
Hey, hey, hey!

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,220
Do you know whom I just ran into?

58
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,950
- Who?
- Yu Ba Bi.

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,200
- Huh?
- I just ran into Team Leader Ba Bi in front of the office.

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,370
He was coming to work.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,060
He's returned to the head office?

62
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,400
That's what I'm saying!

63
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,940
He said today is his first day back. Apparently, he's the marketing team leader.

64
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,010
- Is that so?
- I was really shocked because I met him on my way to work.

65
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,700
He said he would be at the Jeju branch for two years.

66
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,390
Exactly.

67
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,880
In any case, I asked where he was staying...

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,840
I went back to where I was living before.

69
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,810
Ah, really?

70
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,160
I rented it to my hubae for a year.

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,950
But I came back sooner than I thought,

72
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,090
so I said I was sorry and moved back in.

73
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,150
But Team Leader Ba Bi's house is in your neighbourhood.

74
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,090
That's why I thought I needed to tell you.

75
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,330
In case you'd be surprised suddenly running into him in the neighborhood.

76
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,990
Why would I be surprised? If we meet, we meet.

77
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,610
In any case, I'm just saying.

78
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,800
That's why I...

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,360
You're very cool, Yi Da.

80
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,200
Even the section chief is running like this, but you're so relaxed on your way to work.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,380
Very good!

82
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,530
Good, good, good, good!

83
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,110
I'm going, I'm going.

84
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,760
Hey Yumi, I'll call you back.

85
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,130
He said he was moving. Why did he come to Seoul instead of moving?

86
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,410
Stop worrying about it, what does it matter?

87
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,360
Hello?

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,040
Eonni, it's Team Leader Ba Bi!

89
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,750
Team Leader Ba Bi came back to the head office! I just saw him!

90
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,200
I already know.

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh really?

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
- You became the team leader so rapidly.
- Oh, no.

93
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,170
Has he lost some weight?

94
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,360
I think he's become more handsome.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,670
Oh, that's great!

96
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,810
I just made eye contact, I need to greet him. I'm hanging up!

97
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,690
BiBi, Hi!

98
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,010
But Team Leader Ba Bi's house is in your neighbourhood.

99
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,150
If we meet, we meet.

100
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,520
You shouldn't say, "If we meet, we meet."

101
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,730
What would be good about running into him?

102
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,230
Nothing good would come from running into him.

103
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,740
This is how restricted areas were created in the neighborhood.

104
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,390
Yes, I just left.

105
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,280
I'll see you in 30 minutes. Bye.

106
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,760
♫ Will you tell me again? ♫

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,810
Should I buy some scones? Everyone likes them.

108
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,760
This shop that sells really yummy scones was a restricted area.

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,590
Oh, right.

110
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,790
Because Ba Bi was a regular there.

111
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,170
I'll just buy some near the publisher's.
♫ the time had come to be tired of it ♫

112
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,970
I'm hungry.

113
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,170
♫ Ling Ling, don't make a sad face ♫

114
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,350
Shall I make curry?

115
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,030
Get out of the area immediately.

116
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,760
It's dangerous. Ba Bi comes here regularly.

117
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,950
We're going to a different market.

118
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,720
♫ Ling Ling, don't try to be understanding ♫

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,600
Curry
♫ Aside from minor quirks ♫

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,610
I want to make curry and eat it! Curry that I made myself!
♫ I am usually such a person ♫

121
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,840
Why can't we eat scones and curry?

122
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,450
I said I want to eat it!

123
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,660
Tough it out! Do we have to run into him and spoil our mood?

124
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,500
But the thing is

125
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,160
I have a reasonable doubt.

126
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,260
If it's a location that Yumi is avoiding, wouldn't Ba Bi also be avoiding it?

127
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,910
♫ I didn't hear anything ♫

128
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,320
Ba Bi could have designated this area as a place Yumi frequents.

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,440
♫ We're going to fall ♫

130
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,900
♫ (This is nothing) ♫

131
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,990
♫ Even so it's better than being dizzy ♫

132
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,630
♫ Ling Ling, you're such a fool ♫

133
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,940
♫ There isn't anyone who loves you as much as I do ♫

134
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,640
♫ Ling Ling, you'll know eventually ♫

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,930
That was a good point.

136
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,900
Since then, she went to the market frequently,
♫ Ordinary things ♫

137
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,380
but never ran into Ba Bi.

138
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,840
♫ don't suit you at all ♫

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,760
We were getting bolder going in and out of the areas that Ba Bi frequented.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,710
♫ Error! Error! Error! ♫

141
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,020
But there is still a ranking system of the places that Ba Bi frequents.

142
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,760
The café that Ba Bi frequently visits belongs to the high-risk group.

143
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,920
This place is a bit dangerous.

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,910
Why? We don't care, right?

145
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,960
Who cares if we run into Ba Bi? We didn't do anything wrong.

146
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,360
It doesn't matter if we run into him.

147
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,220
But what's with our clothes today?

148
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,770
It would be bad to run into Ba Bi or anyone we know in this condition.

149
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,320
While we're on the subject, let's be honest.

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,380
Why are you dressing Yumi so carelessly these days?

151
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,410
You should at least make her wear something suitable for going out.

152
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,610
That is an outfit suitable for going out.

153
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,530
What? Doesn't she wear that hoodie to sleep?

154
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,830
I was in a good mood, so I elevated its status.

155
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,230
Call it her going out outfit from now on.

156
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,000
- And those pants—
- Don't attack her pants!

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,390
It's the ace of our wardrobe.

158
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,850
No.

159
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,890
It's dangerous to go out dressed like that.

160
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,250
Don't you guys know that urban legend?

161
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,180
What? Urban legend?

162
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,290
If you go out dressed like a bum,

163
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,970
you will run into your ex-boyfriend, or the guy you like,

164
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,760
or your first love, no matter what.

165
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,490
Bum? She's saying things rashly!

166
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,320
There's a terrible curse that you will attract all the men

167
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,070
you know when you're dressed like a bum.

168
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,780
No. You don't need to worry.

169
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,220
Theoretically, there's no way we will run into each other.

170
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,740
Yumi's weekly active hours are from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

171
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,950
Ba Bi gets off of work after 6 p.m.
[Ba Bi's active hours: 6 p.m. - 8 p.m.]

172
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,350
So if she's careful on the weekends, there's likely a zero percent chance that they will run into each other.

173
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,530
Today is Thursday.

174
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,210
No way.

175
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,920
I won't run into him at this hour, will I?

176
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,580
The inside of the café is clear. Ba Bi isn't there.

177
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,010
Okay, we're going inside.

178
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

179
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,780
- Can I get a hot Americano?
- Sure.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,690
Thank you.

181
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,100
- Please, wait. I'll bring it to you right away.
- Sure.

182
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,850
- Hello?
- It's me, Nose.

183
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,950
Oh, Nose. What's up?

184
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,430
I'm smelling Ba Bi coming from somewhere.

185
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,860
What? The smell of Ba Bi?!

186
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,600
The smell of Ba Bi's toner is definitely somewhere ...

187
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,260
Excuse me.

188
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,580
I'd like to order, please.

189
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,780
Oh, hello. Long time no see.

190
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,960
Yes, it's been a long time.

191
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:51,040
♫ Did you doze off last night again? ♫

192
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,250
♫ Are you standing at the end of your path? ♫

193
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,760
Yumi.
♫ Close your eyes and come into my arms ♫

194
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,300
♫ Everything is all right ♫

195
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,330
Here you go!

196
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,450
It feels as if it's been a long time since you came in together.
♫ I can't even express it in words ♫

197
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,470
Yes, it does, right?
♫ After a rainy day ♫

198
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,230
Yes. You said you were working on Jeju Island?

199
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,060
Yes, I came back not too long ago.

200
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,860
Oh, I see. Then I guess I'll see you often again.
♫ who only convey happy memories ♫

201
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,750
Yes.
🎵are an angel. I do.🎵

202
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,900
Would you like to order?

203
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,680
One moment, please.

204
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,380
Sure, take your time.

205
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
It's been a long time.

206
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,090
It has. It's been a long time.

207
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,830
Damn it! Why did he have to show up when she's dressed like a bum?

208
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,030
Our Yumi usually goes around better dressed than this.

209
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,940
Won't he misunderstand? "Yumi must be having a hard time after breaking up with me."

210
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,580
She's not! I'll have you know she's doing just fine!

211
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,250
Ugh, this is unfair!

212
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,170
Sensitivity, don't despair! There's no reason to be intimidated!

213
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,320
Confidence comes from a relaxed expression.

214
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,180
Have you been well?

215
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,200
Yes. Are you doing well?

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,510
You look good too.

217
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,790
He's more relaxed, though?

218
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,610
How are you doing?

219
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,270
Well.

220
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,330
But I didn't expect to run into you here.

221
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,170
I was assigned back to the head office.

222
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,020
Oh, really?

223
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,700
I thought you would have heard about it from Yi Da or Ruby.

224
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,080
That's how it worked out.

225
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,990
But didn't you go to work? Today is a weekday.

226
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh, today is the company's founding anniversary.

227
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,370
Oh, it's been a while since I quit.

228
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,810
Your story is getting better and better.

229
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,480
I'm enjoying reading it.

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,980
He's been reading Yumi's novel?

231
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,370
I thought he wouldn't be reading it.

232
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,730
What's this?

233
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,600
It's honey! It's so sweet!

234
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
Sensitivity, don't be deceived!

235
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,310
- This is Ba Bi's usual personality!
- Let go of me.

236
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,080
His words usually drip with honey. It doesn't have any special meaning!

237
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,610
I know, but it's sweet.

238
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,640
It seems the book is selling well, too. Congratulations.

239
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,690
Let's quickly wrap things up and leave!

240
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,660
Thanks. I'll get going now.

241
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,230
Oh, yeah, bye.

242
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,590
Okay. That was fine.

243
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,850
It would be ridiculous to pretend we don't know each other. And it would be weird to be cold towards each other.

244
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,660
Ba Bi probably wasn't sure how to act either. He must have been flustered too.

245
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,970

This time it didn't stop.

273

The earthquake lasted for several days.

The only one who survived when the whole village collapsed was Judge.

Mirror of Justice, whose fault is it that Ba Bi's village has been destroyed?

- I think I made a mistake—
- Goodbye.

310
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:04,760
How ridiculous. Why was he so worried that another earthquake would happen?

311
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,540
He didn't even realize that the entire village would disappear if it did. Fool.

I'm just asking to see what you think about this.

314
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,980
I'm completely against it, but I should ask what you want to do.

315
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,800
They would like you back at the home office, Team Leader Yu.

316
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,440
I told her that I would go back to Seoul.

317
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,430
If I had stayed in Seoul, I probably wouldn't have broken up with Yumi.

318
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,230
Even the beautiful coastal road and the scenery

319
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,600
are meaningless. I'm sick of it.

320
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,420
- Love!
- You guys are alive!
- You guys!

321
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,520
When he returned to Seoul, his heart calmed down a little bit.

322
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,780
So much so that he looked for Yumi's novel again.

323
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,160
♫ My heart would be like this ♫

324
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,790
Woah, it became even more interesting!

325
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,070
The story flow is so great, Kim Yumi.

326
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,080
This is commendable, Kim Yumi! You're doing great.

327
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,320
If we ever run into Yumi again, let's tell her that we're enjoying the novel.

328
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,370
Have you not come to your senses yet?!

329
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,760
What? Those words have nothing to do with romantic feelings.

330
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,650
It makes it sound as if he still has feelings for her!

331
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,030
Guys! Don't worry about what we'll say if he runs into Yumi.

332
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,000
Instead, let's think of a way not to run into her.

333
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,790
That's right. It's best not to run into her.

334
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,610
Since it will just make both of us uncomfortable.

335
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,220
♫ When the wind blows, it sounds like you walking up to me ♫

336
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,520
I remember every place that we went on a date with Yumi at, so it's no problem.

337
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,990
These are the places Yumi frequents.

338
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,350
Since then, I didn't go to Yumi's favorite places.

339
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,020
It's been two months since I broke up with Yumi.

340
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,820
As time passed on, it gradually became clear.

341
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,260
"If he were to run into Yumi, what does he want to say?"

342
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,420
Ba Bi's heart answered that question like this.

343
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,780
Mirror of Justice

344
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,830
You fools. He already has an answer for the situation you're worrying about

345
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,910
in which he accidentally runs into Yumi!

346
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:07,970
♫ How do you feel? ♫

347
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,470
I realized it in that moment.

348
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,280
What I would want to say if I coincidentally ran into Yumi.

349
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,890
Yumi!

350
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,070
What is it?

351
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,360
I missed you ... terribly.

352
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,440
What's this again? Why is she like this?

353
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,010
Does it make sense to waver just from those few words?

354
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,200
- What are you sayi—
- I missed you so much.

355
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,090
She's seriously wavering.

356
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,120
I can't stand up.

357
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,500
What are you guys doing?

358
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,200
What? Why are you completely fine?

359
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,670
I'm Reason. I have to be centered. You guys are shaken by a comment like that?

360
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:24,700
All right, all right. We treat past lovers coldly.

361
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,780
- "Ba Bi."
- Ba Bi.

362
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,430
"You saying those kinds of words all of a sudden is absu—"

363
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,200
Is Yumi yours? Why are you doing whatever you want?

364
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,280
"Ba Bi, are you listening? Actually, I'm so happy to hear that."

365
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,110
"Honestly, sometimes you even appear in my dreams. There's never been a day when I didn't think about you!"

366
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,480
Huh? Yumi, say it.

367
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,770
What's going on? Why aren't the words coming out of her mouth?

368
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,470
Who says she can? Do you want her to kick her blankets out of embarrassment tonight?!

369
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,380
Hey, plug the cord back in.

Hurt Recording cell.

371
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,730
It seems like Sensitivity has already forgotten why we broke up with Ba Bi.

372
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,120
Remind her again.

373
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,180
Here it is!

Da Eun. Lies. Moving.

376
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,160
Don't tell me you already forgot about Da Eun?

377
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,070
That's right. That's right, he did do that.

378
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,660
That jerk! You hurt her like that and now you come and say you missed her?!

379
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,400
Ba Bi, I'm taken aback since you suddenly said that.

380
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't really want to talk about that. I'm busy, so I'll get going.

381
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,860
Yumi! Can you spare just a moment of your time?

382
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,950
What's happening? What are her feet doing? They should keep walking. Why are they stopping?

383
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,280
This is so interesting.

384
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,580
Eat quietly. I can't hear!

389

Leave. I said leave!

390
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,640
Yumi, attack. You have to overcome Ba Bi.

391
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,730
Why...

392
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,080
Why should I?

393
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,590
Say it more sharply!

394
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,990
Why should I give you any of my time?

395
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,030
- It'll only take a moment.
- I'm not sure.

396
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,840
I don't have anything to say. I...

397
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,360
never missed you.

398
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,530
That's a lie.

399
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,370
- It's not a lie.
- That's a lie.

400
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,020
As expected, Yu Ba Bi is a strong guy. Yumi is seriously wavering!

401
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,410
No, this can't happen. Yumi's life is finally coming together.

402
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,820
Help me, please!

403
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,930
W-w-what are you doing?!

404
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,070
Hey, what are you doing?!

405
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,200
That hurts!

406
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,830
I just want to date Ba Bi again.

407
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,100
Hey! Are you crazy?!

408
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,990
You can't!

409
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,010
I think it'll work if you just get out of here!

410
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,490
Sensitivity, you can't! Don't act of your own volition!

411
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,700
She can't date him again!

412
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,370
Where did he go?

413
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,270
Either way, it's not my problem.

414
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,260
Guys! Ba Bi is being so earnest. There's no reason for us not to take him back.

415
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,450
If you have a reason, try convincing me!

416
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,140
You guys missed Ba Bi, too!

417
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,480
- Well, that's, um...
- It's true.

418
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,220
Who are we? We're the original Yu Ba Bi fan club members!

419
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,770
And what is our motto? "Once an oppa, always an oppa!"

420
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,030
- Th-that's right, an oppa.
- Oppa!

421
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,210
Who are you to say

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,290
that it's a lie?

423

How would you know how I feel?

424
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,540
I can't believe it, seriously.

425
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,430
Honestly, it's what I hope it is.

426
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,080
I hope it was a lie.

427
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,950
That you didn't miss me...

428
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,090
it's a lie, right?

429
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,780
I ...  I missed you, too.

430
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,980
You're right. It's a lie.

Probably.

to get back together again.

447
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,370
What? She's getting back together with Ba Bi?

448
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,010
Why? So you're not too keen on it either.

449

That's...

450
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,300
It's just that Yumi has never gotten back together

with someone she's broken up with.

Yumi...

453
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,170
It says that it will be a different situation than you are hoping it to be

454
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,320
because it's a relationship that has the highest level of difficulty.

455
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Is it difficult to get back together after breaking up?

456
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,550
It says it's really easy to get back together,

457
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,090
but it's really hard to go back to how it was in the past.

458
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,950
Really?

459
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,670
Reason! Go and try to stop them! Yumi might go through a hard time again!

Okay!

Detective! How far have things gone with Ba Bi?

464
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,030
So far, they made up while crying and said they would try again.

♫ A lovely smile can't contain everything ♫

470
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
Ba Bi.

471
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,970
Hi.

472
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,330
- Did you wait long?
- No.

473
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,750
Let's go.

474
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,870
Am I under a spell?

475
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,980
I guess I was really hungry.

476
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,570
- Yumi, shall we do a toast?
- Yeah.

477
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,690
Cheers!

478
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,720
Or has the spell been broken?

479
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,060
I don't know which it is,

480
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,500
Yumi, the wine tastes pretty good, doesn't it?

481
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,230
- Yumi.
- Huh?

482
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,170
- I asked if the wine tastes alright.
- Yes.

483
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,600
- Yes. It's good.
- It is, isn't it?

484
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,290
but maybe that's because it's awkward since it's been such a long time, right?

485
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,930
Let's get another bottle after this.

486
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,990
Episode 32
Ex-Boyfriend VS. Ex-Boyfriend

487
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,190
Oh, excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

488
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,470
Excuse me, ma'am.

489
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,260
Yumi is being chased by a zombie right now.

490
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,080
Today's dream is so intense!

491
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,700
What will our Yumi do?

492
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,620
Run quickly, Yumi!

493
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,790
Yumi, this is all a dream!

494
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,450
Don't be afraid! You just have to wake up!

495
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,740
Stop talking!

496
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,620
It's a dream, a dream!

497
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,850
Yumi, this is a dream!

498
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,770
Yumi woke up. Hurry up and make her snap out of it.

499
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,690
Please remember.

500
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,620
Your name is Kim Yumi. And that was a dream just now.

501
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,170
You are in reality now. Please feel at ease.

502
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,950
So it was a dream.

503
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,330
What a relief.

504
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,430
Why would I dream of a ghost?

505
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,090
Also, please note that you didn't do the dishes from breakfast or lunch

506
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,940
before you fell asleep yesterday.

507
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,140
Also, you decided to date your ex-boyfriend again.

508
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,930
What?

509
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,870
I'm sorry. I missed you.

510
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,540
I missed you so much.

511
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,310
Date Ba Bi again?

512
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,210
That wasn't a dream?

513
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,520
Did you sleep well?

514
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,070
I just left for work.

515
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,710
So it wasn't a dream.

516
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,830
That's right. Yesterday...

517
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,370
I just woke up.

518
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,990
You went to work early.

519
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,610
I couldn't sleep very well, so I just left early.

520
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,200
I'll call you when my meeting is over.

521
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,540
But why am I feeling so strangely calm?

522
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,000
Is it because it still doesn't feel real?

523
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,460
It's because she hasn't fully woken up yet!

524
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,620
Let's quickly drink some coffee and take a shower!

525
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,140
We're dating Ba Bi again!

526
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,950
Huh? Look at that.

527
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,080
Someone's coming.

528
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,420
Oh my god. Love must be coming!

529
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,340
Love came back!

530
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,070
It wasn't her. It was Fashion Terrorist.

531
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,850
Where are you coming back from?

532
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,010
Jail.

533
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,680
I was dragged there because I dressed Yumi in sweat pants yesterday.

534
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,170
I wrote a letter of reflection and was released.

535
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,600
Well, you should have done your job correctly.

536
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,150
Put some care into what she wears today.

537
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,940
She was embarrassed to death yesterday.

538
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,130
Yumi! Aren't you wearing the ring?

539
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,570
She's meeting Ba Bi this evening, so she should wear the couple ring!

540
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,310
Isn't it a little weird to start wearing it already?

541
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,540
Why? Ba Bi will probably wear his too.

542
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,360
Still, that isn't urgent right now.

543
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,430
Then let's take a selfie.

544
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,180
Why? Because she likes her outfit?

545
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,680
That's not it.

546
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,650
We should announce that we're dating Ba Bi again on social media!

547
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,110
This will show it.

548
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:53,140
Please don't do things like that!

549
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,540
Then how about changing our profile status to a heart?

550
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,770
Please enter a status message.

551
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,910
Heart

552
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,580
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

553
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,500
Why?! Why aren't you letting me do anything?

554
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,510
Are you ashamed of dating Ba Bi?

555
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,390
Are you still feeling uncertain?

556
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,050
Do you regret it? Is that it?

557
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,750
It's not that. There's no reason to let everyone in Yumi's life know.

558
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,620
They've just started dating again.

559
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,220
Welcome.

560
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,270
Did you wait long?

561
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,190
Oh?

562
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,960
- What is it?
- Wait.

563
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,650
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

564
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,490
Miss Writer, are you possibly dating?

565
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:06,860
Well, you wouldn't be dressed like that today because of meeting me.

566
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,820
Well... I've always been like this.

567
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,780
No, you haven't. Are you kidding me?

568
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,560
Why won't she answer him? He's asking if she's dating!

569
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,300
She should answer that she is!

570
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,850
Wait just a second.

571
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:23,780
Why the heck do you keep stopping me?!

572
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,420
Do you not remember what we said to Control Z before?

573
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,030
He said he was swayed when an intern confessed to him.

574
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,150
That's why we broke up.

575
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,810
Really?

576
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,140
We told him all that, so what would he say if we told him we were dating him again?

577
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,500
So you're saying we should keep it a secret?

578
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,940
Are you embarrased of our Ba Bi?! Is that it?!

579
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,000
Don't tell me you were expecting to run into someone today, so you came out dressed like that?

580
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,690
What? Run into whom?

581
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,710
It's nothing.

582
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,600
Anyway, your outfit is nice today. Good job.

583
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,630
Do you review my outfits, too?

584
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,150
For now, it's a relief that you seem willing to date.

585
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,170
Then finish the edits by next Wednesday.

586
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,760
Give me some more time and make it Thursday.

587
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,620
All right. Thursday, then.

588
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,740
Here he comes.

589
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,860
Hyeong Wung!

590
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,980
Oh! Yumi is here too.

591
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,520
Wung.

592
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,710
I had a meeting with Writer Yumi today. You didn't know?

593
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,140
I had no idea.

594
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,250
Hyeong Wung said he had a meeting at his company and that he would give me a ride on his way there.

595
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,750
You ended up meeting like this again somehow.

596
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,200
Is this a coincidence or fate?

597
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,380
This can't be. I can see right through him!

598
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,680
Yumi, where are you going?

599
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,280
I'm going to Jongno—

600
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,090
Then get in. I'll drop you off on my way.

601
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,330
There's no need. Isn't your company in the opposite direction?

602
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:19,810
Hyeong Wung said his hobby is driving around the busy city and showing off his car.

603
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,350
His hobby is to show off, right?

604
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,590
Get in.

605
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,250
Hyeong, thank you. I'll get off here.

606
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,690
- Miss Writer, I'll see you next week.
- Okay.

607
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,580
Fighting!

608
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,730
I'll also get out here. You don't have to take me all the way there.

609
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,020
I'll take you.

610
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,970
You said you have a meeting.

611
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,350
It's a meeting between the departments. They'll probably all be nervous if the CEO showed up.

612
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,300
There's no need to let everyone in my life know that I'm dating Ba Bi again,

613
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,940
but I felt like I should let Wung know.

614
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,040
Wung, are you busy right now?

615
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,750
Hm?

616
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,260
If you have some time, shall we go somewhere and have a cup of coffee?

617
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,950
Coffee? Right now?

618
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,330
If you're busy, we can go another time.

619
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,050
I'm not that busy.

620
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,690
All right.

621
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,640
Your novel has been getting a good response these days.

622
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,020
No, well. It's not that good.

623
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,580
I just happened to come across it the other day.

624
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,460
All the comments were complimentary.

625
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,080
You looked at it? That's embarrassing.

626
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,810
Why? Everyone was praising you.

627
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,430
That was just a coincidence. There's a lot of malicious comments, too.

628
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,680
How is writing?

629
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,220
It's fun.

630
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,790
I've got more time for myself compared to when I was working full time.

631
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,850
Writers usually write at night, right?

632
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,010
No. I usually work in the morning and afternoon,

633
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,690
and then relax at night.

634
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,000
We caught you, Kim Yumi!

635
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,050
She is free in the evenings!

636
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,620
We will make dinner plans starting now.

637
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,990
So you don't work in the evenings.

638
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,100
That's right.

639
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,890
Then you will probably be free this evening, too.

640
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,460
This evening,

641
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,820
I made plans to meet with my boyfriend.

642
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,250
You don't have a boyfriend.

643
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,810
- I do.
- No, you don't have one.

644
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,340
I decided to get back together with my ex.

645
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,500
WARNING

646
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,240
What's the alarm for now?

647
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,260
Emergency! Emergency!

648
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,630
Yumi is dating Yu Ba Bi again.

649
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,530
Emergency situation because of that guy!

650
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,610
I'm really sick and tired of him!

651
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,640
Really?

652
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,540
Yes.

653
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,970
Don't joke around.

654
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:23,750
I really am.

655
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,460
Kim Yumi! Are you stupid?

656
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,360
There is plenty of fish in the sea!

657
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,880
Why are you dating someone you already broke up with?

658
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,240
Hey, Love, calm down.

659
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,920
I guarantee that

660
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,350
they will fight and break up for the same reason in less than a month!

661
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,350
Isn't it hard to date again after breaking up?

662
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,340
- Why?
- That's what everyone says.

663
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,830
That's what happened to all the couples I knew, they broke up in the end.

664
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,510
♫ while we talk quietly?​ ♫

665
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,660
Emergency Situation! Emergency Situation!

666
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,540
Wung is talking a lot of nonsense.

667
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,170
What's nonsense about that? Everything he said was right!

668
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,770
You idiot! Wung is also an ex-boyfriend.

669
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:09,200
If you speak ill of her ex-boyfriend Yu Ba Bi, then Wung gets affected too!

670
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,930
Wung has now fallen into the ex-boyfriend paradox.

671
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,980
I don't care if he gets affected by it!

672
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,530
If she's not going to date me, then I'm going to make it fair and not let her date that jerk either!

673
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,950
Hey. Just say congratulations and end it.

674
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,150
Are you crazy? I can never say that!

675
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,470
That's good.

676
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,650
Good for you.

677
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:47,590
Thanks for saying that.

678
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,330
1 - Boyfriend, 2 - Friend, 3 - A guy she knows

679
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,800
If he's not going to date her, then I don't want to do this.

680
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,620
Don't be greedy. We have to at least keep the friend title.

681
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,010
I'm also not giving up yet.

682
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,400
Let's think of the future, huh?

683
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,900
3rd - A guy she knows

684
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,890
2nd - A friend

685
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:20,490
All right then, we will now complete the ceremony for the friend title.

686
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,230
You're not uncomfortable around me, right?

687
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,460
Why would I be? I'm not uncomfortable.

688
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,910
Then let's occasionally see each other like this.

689
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,330
I like talking with you.

690
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:39,470
I'm sorry, I think my boyfriend may be uncomfortable with that.

691
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,680
What? They can't even be friends?

692
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,760
He even said things that he didn't mean! I want to take it all back!

693
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,590
Calm down, calm down, Love.

694
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,350
Yumi, you got a bit old-fashioned.

695
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,770
You know, I'm a little old-fashioned.

696
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:01,570
♫ I was looking forward to your heart ♫

697
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,990
Shall we get going?

698
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,410
What about Control Z?

699
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,910
Control Z is also a man, but you see him all the time.

700
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:11,910
Why can't I see you when you're seeing other men like him?

701
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:17,320
Illustrator Z is someone I work with.

702
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,480
- I suppose.
- Yes.

703
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,780
How can they get back together so easily?

704
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,470
What's so special about that jerk?!

705
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,840
How can she forgive him so easily when you broke up with him because he cheated?!

706
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,880
Hey! I'm begging you, that's enough!

707
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,190
Let's sort it out and leave quickly! We've been embarrassing enough.

708
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,210
All right, let's go.

709
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,110
I have a meeting too.

710
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,520
Okay, let's go.

711
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,770
Wung, I'm going to take a taxi.

712
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,040
I'll give you a ride.

713
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,460
No need.

714
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,480
I said I would, you don't like that either?

715
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,810
It's not that I don't like it. It's because I feel bad.

716
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,570
I said I would give you a ride. Can't I even do that?

717
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,300
Hey, if you refuse like that, you're going to make me really disapp—

718
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,620
- Are you okay?
- Wung!

719
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

720
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,730
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

721
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,670
Have a good night.

722
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,540
Ba Bi, can you talk?

723
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,980
Marketing Department

724
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,860
Hello?

725
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,040
- Yumi.
- Did you leave work?

726
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,770
I just left. Are you already here?

727
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:48,010
No. I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to be late.

728
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,670
Why?

729
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,870
I'm at the hospital right now.

730
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,250
There was a bit of an accident.

731
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,760
An ac-accident? Are you hurt?!

732
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,910
No, not me but the person I was with.

733
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,960
He isn't hurt that badly.

734
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,510
He hit his hand on the car door.

735
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:09,660
It's fractured and he's getting treated right now. I think I need to stay here for a bit longer.

736
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,340
Who was it?

737
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,710
Oh ... about that ...

738
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,070
It's Gu Wung.

739
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,610
He's close with the illustrator I'm working with.

740
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,650
So we coincidentally met today.

741
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,730
Oh, really?

742
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,730
I see.

743
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,270
All right.

744
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,660
What hospital is it?

745
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,090
Okay, don't worry.

746
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,720
Call me when you're done.

747
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,630
Bye.

748
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,020
Did you get a shot?

749
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,820
They said to wait a bit.

750
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,730
You said your employee is coming to pick you up, right?

751
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:17,900
When is he coming?

752
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,970
He's on the way but said there is traffic.

753
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,480
Thanks for coming with me.

754
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,970
You can go now. You said you had a date.

755
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,430
I'll go when your employee gets here.

756
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,920
I'm fine. Go ahead. That guy is probably going to misunderstand.

757
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,370
Why would he? You had an accident.

758
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,080
You can go. I'm fine.

759
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,590
I'm really fine.

760
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:50,390
Then ... I feel bad making him wait too long,

761
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,680
so I'll get going now.

762
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,800
Take care of yourself.

763
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,350
Sure.

764
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,150
That keeps bothering me.

765
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,520
Oh no! It must have ripped earlier when he fell.

766
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,480
How can Wung be the same as ever?

767
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,030
Whenever I see Wung, I feel kind of bad.

768
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,980
Being next to Wung for even one minute

769
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,620
makes me want to take care of him.

770
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,370
When I think of him going home alone like that,

771
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,550
it's sad.

772
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,870
I'm suddenly remembering something.

773
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,330
Excuse me! Wait!

774
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,100
Over here, over here! Wait!

775
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,010
Please take a look at her. She's an emergency patient!

776
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,650
Yumi was a patient in this hospital before, too.

777
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,640
Back then, Wung bought her clothes to change into.

778
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,620
Ribbit

779
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,540
I'll be right back.

780
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,990
- I said to go.
- I'll be quick.

781
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,050
Where are you going?

782
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,980
Yumi!

783
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,180
I should call Ba Bi to tell him I'm going to be even later.

784
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,610
Did I leave it there?

785
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,590
What should I do?

786
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,880
Where did she go?

787
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,220
Hello.

788
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,700
Do you remember me?

789
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,040
Yes, of course.

790
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,690
I'm Yu Ba Bi.

791
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,260
It's been a while.

792
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,740
It has.

793
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,840
Are you all right? I heard you were hurt.

794
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,960
Yes, as you can see.

795
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,460
It's nothing serious but I interrupted your date.

796
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,380
It's all right.

797
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, it's good to see that you are all right.

798
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,850
But where did Yumi go?

799
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,140
She isn't answering her phone.

800
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,080
She left her phone and went somewhere.

801
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,540
She probably will be here soon. She said she'd be right back.

802
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,170
I see.

803
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,360
Don't worry.

804
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,620
Because Yumi isn't that kind of person.

805
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,070
Sorry?

806
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:46,590
She doesn't get swayed easily, unlike someone else.

807
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,870
Just in case you were worried.

808
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:55,800
Unlike someone else?

809
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,940
Yes. Unlike someone else.

810
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,900
♫ In so many thoughts we ♫

811
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,940
♫  meet again on another day ♫

812
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:29,280
♫ Let's put behind us our weary hearts  ♫

813
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,930
♫  and think about someone ♫

814
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:37,090
♫ Because in matters which had nothing to do with me ♫

815
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,960
♫ I uselessly took an interest ♫

816
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,350
♫ In the times ♫

817
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,580
Yumi's Cells 2
Preview

818
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,900
Guys, this is war!

819
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,650
Because Yumi isn't the kind of person who gets swayed easily.

820
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,110
Sir, the management team meeting has been rescheduled for tomorrow morning.

821
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,940
What time is the meeting?

822
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,280
Seoul.*
(* Seoul the city sounds the same as Seoul time.)

823
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,560
♫ Although my fading image may seem miserable ♫

824
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,220
Don't feel pressured.

825
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,520
Let's not care too much about things like this.

826
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,710
Something keeps going wrong little by little.

827
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:13,900
It wasn't like this in the past.

828
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:18,760
♫ When this time passes ♫
