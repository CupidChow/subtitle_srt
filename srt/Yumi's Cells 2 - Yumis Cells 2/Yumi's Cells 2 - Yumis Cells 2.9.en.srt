Yumi's Cells 2

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,320
Professional Translator
Work-related conversation: The person in charge isn't here ... I'll take that into consideration next time.
What I really think: It's none of my business. I won't do it this time.

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,840
Episode 24 Professional Business Meeting

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,010
Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong: Writer Yumi

5
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,090
Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong: I'll do my best to select one. Please do your best to edit. I'll contact you when it's decided.

6
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,760
Writer Yumi.

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,880
We have chosen someone to do the web novel illustrations.

8
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,970
Really? (heart is pounding)

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,190
The illustrator will also be coming to the meeting on Wednesday.

10
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,640
All right, I got it.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,620
Green
Syndrome

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

13
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:34,390
This is Control Z, the illustrator who will illustrate your work from now on.

14
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,590
Hello, I am Control Z.

15
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,160
- Control Ji...
- Z.

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,630
- Sorry?
- Z.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Z

18
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,640
Oh, the letter Z.
Control + Z

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,280
What's with his pen name?

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,960
Control Z.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,540
It's rude to laugh after hearing someone's pen name.

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,010
Go! Go home and laugh all you want!

23
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,820
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

24
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,060
It's really rude to do that when you first meet someone.

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,590
You have to hold it in!

26
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,690
You know the Control-Z keyboard shortcut? He says it stands for that.

27
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,820
Everyone calls him Con Ji.

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,600
Con Z, not Con Ji.

29
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,800
I see.

30
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,890
Nice to meet you, I am Kim Yumi.

31
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,590
- Have a seat.
- All right.

32
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,280
He is the illustrator who worked on the covers of our book series.

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,060
This time we went to a lot of effort to ask him and were barely able to get him—

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,210
Sorry.

35
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,890
I need to take this call.

36
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,030
Yes, this is Ahn Dae Yong.

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,120
I really liked the cover of that series.

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,100
Of course, you did.

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,130
- Is that the new manuscript?
- Yes.

40
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,600
Can I read it?

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,590
Yes, of course. I brought it for the two of you anyway.

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,420
Oh, I will go get it.

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,650
He's unusual. Even his name is unusual.

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,900
His personality also seems unusual.

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,240
Please enjoy.

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,430
You ordered an iced latte, correct?

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,080
♫ Yeah ♫

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,780
He just laughed, is there a funny part?

49
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,850
Did you find it?

50
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,770
What did that snort just now mean?

51
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,370
That snort is the sound that comes out unknowingly even though one had no intention of laughing.

52
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,410
Huh, then ...

53
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,140
That just now ...

54
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,620
was him cracking up.

55
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,740
This version must be fun!

56
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,320
Thank you, I finished reading.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,150
It still needs some polishing, but what did you think of the manuscript?

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,510
How should I put it?

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,610
This genre is definitely

60
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,350
not my type.

61
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,260
Should I say it is zero reality?

62
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,480
Reality zero?

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
Then the snort wasn't because it was funny!

64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,230
It seems so...

65
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,450
Then what was that snort?

66
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,680
According to my new analysis,

67
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,700
I think it was a sound that came out because of how absurdly unrealistic it was.

68
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,580
What?

69
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,870
No matter how unrealistic it was, saying it is a bit too much.

70
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,410
Writer! It makes me upset hearing that it's too unrealistic.

71
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,480
Am I the weird one?

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,450
No, you're normal.

73
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,330
That's completely rude to say to the writer!

74
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,590
Right?

75
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,750
Being upset after hearing that is normal, right?!

76
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,170
But...
- One second.

77
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,060
This is a professional business meeting.

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,750
You worked at a company for a long time, so you should know that.

79
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,710
When you work, you meet all kinds of people, right?

80
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,530
Yes, that's true.

81
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,860
It's something you have to just cooly laugh at and move on from.

82
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,150
You guys go ahead and be cool about it!

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,660
But ... which part is unrealistic?

84
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,630
I just informally gave my opinion.

85
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,260
Did it make you uncomfortable?

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,870
What is he saying now?

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Unintelligible

88
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,570
- Seriously.
- That jerk.

89
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,110
He seems to be polite,

90
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,400
but he's just the opposite.

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,300
In other words, what he means is this:

92
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,090
I just informally gave my opinion.

93
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,970
- Are you 
- pissed off?

94
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,320
Of course not, feel free to tell me.

95
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,360
What part made you feel that it was unrealistic?

96
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,030
First, I think the couples from here are too honest with each other.

97
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,510
I told you it's unrealistic.

98
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,360
- Is that so?
- Yes, a little bit.

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,070
Completely unrealistic.

100
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,640
It's not actually like that in reality.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,930
You haven't dated, have you, kid?

102
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,820
I tried to let it go and move on,

103
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,610
but this isn't right.

104
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,430
We are professionals. Let's turn this around like a professional.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,620
I'm not so sure about that. In my experience, that isn't the case.

106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,740
Is there something you don't know?

107
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,520
You haven't dated, have you, kid?

108
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,330
I'm in a relationship.

109
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,540
Couldn't the standard for judging whether it's unrealistic or not

110
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,460
come down to a difference in experience?

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,160
Well. Since everyone has different experiences.

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,710
And you're the only one who's like that.

113
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,270
You're the only one who's like that.

114
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,310
Good job. That was calm, sophisticated, and mature.

115
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,870
Well, that's true, it would be different for everyone.

116
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,140
Then I guess you must be the kind of person who's always honest when dating?

117
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,550
Always? 100%?

118
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,330
Wow, you're amazing.

119
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,300
That an always, 100% honest relationship is possible.

120
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,730
You're shameless.

121
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,830
- I mean—
- I'm envious, that's all.

122
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,440
I hope that I can also have such a relationship once in my life.

123
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,660
The coffee is good.

124
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,000
You're shameless.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,310
and your manuscript,

126
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,050
completely unrealistic.

127
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,270
Game over.

128
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,700
- All right.
- That's okay.

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,970
Sorry, the phone call took a while.

130
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,870
Were you able to discuss a lot?

131
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes, well.

132
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,460
I respect Illustrator Control Z's opinion.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,230
However, he hasn't experienced everything that others have, has he?

134
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,160
It's a very dangerous idea to conclude that

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,390
everything you've never experienced is unrealistic.

136
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,530
That is what you call prejudice.

137
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,580
Above all, I don't think it's right to entrust the illustration of my work

138
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,050
to someone who thinks my work is unrealistic.

139
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,350
In conclusion, this is what I want to say!

140
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,210
You're

141
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,240
out.

142
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,420
Would you stop worrying about something that's already happened and go?

143
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,220
It's time for Yumi to sleep.

144
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,250
Seriously! I should have said 'You're out, out!' right then.

145
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,690
What a rude brat!

146
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,470
We'll see if he can even draw well, damn it.

147
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,540
Writer, hello.

148
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,390
Hello.

149
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,890
I see you got here early.

150
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,870
Yes, a little.

151
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,820
Professional business meetings continue, no matter how much you hate them.

152
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,870
A Hawaiian coffee for me, please.

153
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,940
Could I have a milk tea, please?

154
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,810
And one castella for me.

155
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,020
Sensitivity: What? Why is he only ordering one?

156
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,370
We have a mouth too!

157
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,790
- Hunger: Order it! Order it! Order it for us too!
- Sure.

158
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,790
Just a second, please.

159
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,680
Would you like to order something?

160
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,190
The castella here is delicious, order that.

161
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,380
No, I don't like it.

162
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,080
I absolutely don't want to eat what that jerk recommends.

163
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm telling you the castella is delicious.

164
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,860

165
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,510
I'll have a ginger pie, please.

166
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,340
Sure.

167
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,440
You deliberately ordered something different.

168
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
What are you talking about?

169
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,040
I've always liked ginger pie.

170
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,910
The ginger pie here really doesn't taste good.

171
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,230
Watch what you say about whatever I ordered!

172
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,640
You! Have you ever said one kind thing to anyone?

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
You thoughtless jerk!

174
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,000
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

175
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,760
Take a look at this scene, please.

176
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,830
The situation and the picture don't match.

177
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,030
They haven't met in a long time, so it's a very heart-fluttering situation, but take a look here.

178
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,020
These eyes.

179
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,190
Aren't the man's eyes too sunken in?

180
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,590
Rather than being heart-fluttering, his expression looks as if he's bored and wants to go home.

181
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,720
I think it needs fixing.

182
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,180
Oh, also, if you look at the next scene.

183
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,130
It's a situation that needs to show the main character's sincerity,

184
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,060
but it's far from it ...

185
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,090
Hunger: Yuck! What's wrong with this?

186
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,840
It tastes so bad!

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,470
This is crazy! It tastes like trash!

188
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,380
Sensitivity: Hey! Won't you be quiet? Just deal with it and eat it.

189
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,610
Pretend it's delicious!

190
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,800
Writer Yumi.

191
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,030
Eat mine.
You said you liked ginger pie.

192
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,240
Ginger.

193
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,300
I was right, wasn't I?

194
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,330
See? Didn't I tell you the ginger pie was disgusting?

195
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,690
No, it's good.

196
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,580
This is good?

197
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,480
Wow, your taste buds are really stubborn.

198
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,350
You're shameless.

199
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,120
Also, they say ginger is good for colds.

200
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,670
- I was feeling a cold coming on, so this turned out well.
- You caught a cold? A c-cold?

201
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,620
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

202
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,680
I mean, it's not serious. My body is just slightly ...

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
You didn't put your fork on the castella, did you?

204
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,380
- I didn't.
- Thank goodness.

205
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,330
I came thinking you had gotten off work, but you weren't home, so I just left these.

206
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,070
The golden oranges from our farm grew well.

207
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,130
Please enjoy! Da Eun said she is doing well.

208
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,360
Thank you for looking after Da Eun.

209
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Da Eun's mom.

210
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,180
- Yumi!
 - Ba Bi! Did you get off work?

211
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,830
Yeah, I just got home.

212
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,890
- But what's with your expression?
- Why?

213
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,150
- You look really tired.
- Yeah, I am tired. Like I said, I just got home.

214
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,650
But where are you?

215
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,060
- I'm waiting for the bus after finishing a meeting.
- But what's with your expression?

216
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,900
- Why?
- It looks like you've been through hell.

217
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm completely exhausted.

218
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,700
I'm exhausted because I had a meeting with someone I hate so much.

219
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,150
- Are you talking about that illustrator?
- Yes.

220
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,960
It was nice when I was unemployed. As expected, I don't like the people

221
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,760
I meet through work.

222
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,780
Can't you ask them to change the illustrator?

223
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,200
It's too late. And he draws well.

224
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,710
I see. Then you have to put up with it.

225
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,950
I do. But ...

226
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,010
he's so, so, so annoying.

227
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,670
I mean, earlier he made me so annoyed just with one cake.

228
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,660
He ordered just one castella for himself, even though I was hungry too.

229
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,480
And when she came home.

230
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,870
What is this?

231
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,040
♫ I spend the day constantly acting fearless ♫

232
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,400
♫ and before I know it ♫

233
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,350
♫ the night arrives ♫

234
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,210
♫ The dark night ♫

235
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:36,980
♫ The sadness which I've endured all day ♫

236
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,030
- Hello?
- Ba Bi!

237
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,720
- Did you send me the cakes?
- Did it already arrive?

238
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Eat whichever one you like, in place of that ginger pie.

239
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,380
Ba Bi,

240
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,780
thank you.

241
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,240
Who cares about Control Z.

242
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,510
We received this kind of gift!

243
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,400
And we have a boyfriend who gives this kind of gift!

244
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
One second.

245
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,160
- Yumi!
- Ba Bi!

246
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,960
Eat it all by yourself, don't give any to anyone else!

247
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,240
Okay. I miss you, Ba Bi.

248
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,330
I miss you too.

249
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,840
And we are in a lovey-dovey relationship like this.

250
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,320
When you combine all this,

251
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,700
its bragging worth is over level 99!

252
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,390
If it's at this rate, then it's equivalent to bragging about the trip to Thailand.

253
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,960
Upload it on social media immediately!

254
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,990
Yahoo! Cake. Surprise gift.

255
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,340
The fun of eating whichever I want. Thank you, Ba Bi.

256
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,240
The ginger pie must have been a shock.

257
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,780
You've got enough to last you until next year.

258
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,750
The cakes are so pretty! It must be delicious.

259
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm so jealous, Writer Kim! I'm going to eat some.

260
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,900
- Ha ha ha ha ha.
- What are you doing there?

261
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,690
Hello. I'm Control Z. Z.

262
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,100
Why are you here?

263
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,450
More than that, it's not even a funny picture.

264
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,210
What's with the 'ha ha ha ha ha'?

265
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,740
I'll explain it to you. It's all in this book.

266
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,050
Explaining The Ha

267
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,640
A book that compiles the different meanings of 'ha' in various situations.

268
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,150
One 'ha' used on a picture that isn't even funny means it is a snort.

269
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,990
Two ha's: Ha ha. It means, "I have nothing to say."

270
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,400
Five ha's: Hahahahaha.

271
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,280
It means they're 100% laughing at us.

272
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,990
What is it? Why are you laughing at me?

273
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,060
Who do you think you are?

274
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,670
Call Profanity cell!

275
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,220
Profanity cell. Currently serving a life sentence in prison.

276
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,970
Thank you.

277
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,310
Hey b*tch! It's been a f*cking long time.

278
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,580
Yumi is f*cking looking for me? Is that f*cking true?

279
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,290
That's right. Go on, swear a lot.

280
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,530
Sensitivity, you crazy b*tch!

281
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,060
Not to me!

282
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,860
To Control Z.

283
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,170
I'm f*cking sorry. You should have told me earlier. F*ck . I didn't know.

284
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,370
What is it, you f*cking b*stard?

285
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,670
Why are you laughing at me, you annoying b*stard?

286
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,730
I can't stand it. I think I need to write something.

287
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,850
Wait. He's someone you met through work and you are a new writer.

288
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,110
It can be fatal to your reputation.

289
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,450
Let's not forget! This is a professional business meeting.

290
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,530
That's right. I'm the only one who looks foolish when I get angry rashly.

291
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,100
Reply

292
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,030
In professional business meetings, you can't use crude curse words.

293
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,490
However ...

294
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,860
any employee should always keep in mind that this

295
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,400
may be the worst curse you can send to another person.

296

Episode 25
Things Yumi hate

298
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,100
Hello. I am Dislike cell.

299
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,610
I manage all the things that Yumi hates.

300
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,770
Things like this ... I love it.

301
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,030
I can smell the toner from your scarf. I love it.

302
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,830
But from some point on, Yumi didn't really hate many things,

303
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,910
so I spend most of my time playing in the water or taking naps.

304
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,600
But recently, something Yumi hates a lot has appeared.

305
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,350
That is this guy!

306
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,140
- Z.
- A person she hates. Charges: Bad Manners

307
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,320
It's been a long time since someone she really hates appeared.

308
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,580
Writer. How about Monday for the next meeting?

309
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,410
I'm going to Jeju Island. I'll be back at the beginning of the new year.

310
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,120
Jeju Island?

311
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,460
Yes. I'll see you in the new year.

312
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh ...! I'm jealous.

313
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,440
You are spending the end of the year holidays on Jeju Island.

314
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,160
Are you jealous? Then go on your own trip.

315
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,440
^^

316
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,710
Using two smiling eyes on you is a waste.

317
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,500
I hate him so much.

318
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,950
I also have a temper. If you annoy me, I will start swearing.

319
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,270
♫ I only wanna be with you everyday ♫

320
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,520
Hello?

321
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,080
Ba Bi, I've just arrived and I'm on my way in a taxi.

322
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,940
Of course, I also change according to the person I am with.

323
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,840
Yumi, the meeting has started now, so I'll call you later.

324
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,150
Okay, I'll text you as soon as I reach home. Bye.

325
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,280
♫ Because it is you who welcomed timid me ♫

326
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,020
The second Christmas I'm spending with Ba Bi.

327
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,120
This time we decided to stay in Jeju Island till New Year.

328
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,490
♫ Everyday higher than the sky there ♫

329
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,520
♫ I want my feelings to be ♫

330
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,630
♫ wholly delivered to you ♫

331
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,740
♫ Awesome day if it becomes your day ♫

332
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,910
♫ so you can always smile ♫

333
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,930
♫ and clear your clouds away ♫

334
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:49,000
♫ Everyday ♫

335
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,610
♫ Everyday ♫

336
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,450
The kitchen is a little disappointing. Besides that it is perfect.

337
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,850
Well, you aren't going to use it a lot.

338
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,650
That's true, but my wife likes to cook.

339
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,280
If it's just the two of you, that's more than enough.

340
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,980
Who are you?

341
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,890
Why have you come here?

342
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,250
You must be the tenant's wife. Hello.

343
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,900
No, I'm a friend.

344
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,750
I see. We came to see the house.

345
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,300
I came after I talked with the tenant on the phone earlier.

346
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,020
He let me know the front door passcode.

347
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,770
You came to see the house?

348
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,040
Yes. The tenant is giving up the house.

349
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,340
Just a minute.

350
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,910
Hello? Did you get home?

351
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:49,620
- Yes. But did you give up the house?
- Huh?

352
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,310
I arrived and someone was seeing the house.

353
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,380
Oh, those people came already?

354
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,170
- They said they'll come around five o'clock.
- You're going to move?

355
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,550
- Yes.
- Why?

356
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,590
I think I should move near the office.

357
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,370
I want to move to an apartment.

358
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,850
Why all of a sudden? You said you liked this house.

359
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,170
At first, I did. But I think it's too far from the office.

360
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,840
Also, commuting to and from work is too long.

361
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,190
You said the morning and evening drive along the coast is a dream.

362
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,730
I did. But that was also for a few days only.

363
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,030
A few of the employees live in the apartment in front of the office and they said it's really nice.

364
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,910
The airport is close too.

365
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,030
I suppose.

366
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,220
You should do what you want.

367
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,210
But I like this house a lot. It's a shame.

368
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,140
There's a yard too.

369
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,320
- Then, we'll get going.
- Goodbye.

370
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,660
I'm also taking a quick break. I have to go back in.

371
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,000
- I'll call you once I'm done.
- All right. Bye.

372
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,110
It's so nice.

373
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,150
Then is this my last time here?

374
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,010
That's a shame. Yumi liked it.

375
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,230
But, isn't he moving very suddenly?

376
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,330
He's moving out of the blue.

377
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,280
He says the commute is really tough.

378
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't you remember just last week when he said driving to and from work is the happiest part of his day?

379
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,850
It's weird. Why did he suddenly start disliking the happiest part of his day?

380
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,230
- I'm not sure.
- I think I know something.

381
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,050
What is it?

382
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,960
Recently, there's one missing element of that drive.

383
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,210
What is it?

384
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,060
Da Eun.

385
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,570
There I go again.

386
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,820
Let's stop, Kim Yumi. Why are you being like a loser?

387
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,920
Nice! It's really pretty.

388
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,580
I should upload stuff like this on social media.

389
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,540
If I upload this, that Control Z jerk might laugh at me again.

390
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,350
Laugh at me again and I will get revenge on you very cruelly.

391
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,230
It's done. It'll be perfect if I just go buy the cake.

392
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,440
Hello. Cake...

393
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, this is pretty.

394
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,430
- I'll take the middle one.
- Sure.

395
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,020
- Do you need candles too?
- Yes. Give me two, please.

396
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,910
Oh my god. It's visible from here too.

397
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,500
It changed the whole neighborhood's vibe.

398
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,620
Kim Yumi, you're sensible.

399
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
Miss Da Eun?

400
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,160
Hello, it's been a while.

401
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,130
Oh, yes. Hello.

402
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,450
I heard you got a job at Busan.

403
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,810
- You must have come home.
- Yes, because of the holidays.

404
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,550
My mom asked me to come home.

405
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,460
I see.

406
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:27,540
The Christmas tree is so pretty.

407
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,660
It's pretty, right? I decorated it.

408
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,030
Yes, it's very pretty.

409
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,720
It really feels like Christmas.

410
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,400
Is work fun?

411
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,890
Yes, well, it is fun.

412
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,330
That's good.

413
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,780
Which company do you work at?

414
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,370
I work for a logistics company. The head office is at the Busan port.

415
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,860
Oh, I see.

416
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,400
- Something seems to have changed about Da Eun.
- You're right. She has changed.

417
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,450
What changed?

418
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,070
She isn't able to meet our eyes?

419
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,410
Oh, right. I'm enjoying it.

420
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,900
- What?
- Your web novel.

421
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,370
Oh my. Really?

422
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,940
Its only been a few weeks since it was published.

423
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,070
I also turned on the notifications for it

424
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,060
and I've been reading it every Monday and Thursday morning.

425
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,870
Thank you.

426
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,160
Ah, but this is really embarrassing.

427
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,650
It's really fun.

428
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,210
Thank you.

429
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,160
That's not it. She's fine now.

430
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,930
She's meeting our eyes.

431
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,390
- Then I'll get going.
- Sure.

432
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,260
But it will be hard to see you now that Ba Bi is moving.

433
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,510
- What?
- He's giving up the house.

434
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,740
He's moving to an apartment in the city.

435
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,990
- So now it will be really hard to see—
- Why?

436
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,100
Is it because of me?

437
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,130
What?

438
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,960
Because of you, Miss Da Eun?

439
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,080
Oh, I'm sorry!

440
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,710
I'm suddenly remembering something from years ago.

441
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,740
Before she started dating Ba Bi and Wung.

442
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,210
We made a lot of dislikes with Yi Da when she was single.

443
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,420
- Yumi.
- Huh?

444
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,920
Let's say you have a boyfriend.

445
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,780
That won't happen.

446
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,600
Let's just say it happens.

447
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,120
Imagine it. Anyway, you got a boyfriend.

448
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,850
That boyfriend still hasn't forgotten his ex.

449
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,680
What? I would totally hate that. Then we'd break up immediately.

450
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,250
Your boyfriend was swayed by someone else for just a moment.

451
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,230
But it was just a moment.

452
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,700
I'd hate that too.

453
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,030
Right away. I'd break up right away.

454
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:23,150
Then a boyfriend who's nice to his female friends?

455
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,340
- Nice to them?
- Yes.

456
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,660
How nice?

457
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,080
Really sweet.

458
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,900
Gives them a jacket—

459
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,720
I totally hate that! I'll break up immediately.

460
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,980
Got it. Okay.

461
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,820
Then what about a boyfriend who thinks

462
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,220
that some other girl is cute?

463
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,940
I seriously totally hate that.

464
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,040
She wasn't joking back then.

465
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,900
There was a time when we made more than 20 dislikes a day.

466
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,780
Ah, I remember those days.

467
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,300
All right, all right.

468
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,700
All the dislikes of dating are all made from back then.

469
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,780
There are so many!

470
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,710
I hate that.

471
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,410
What's going on?

472
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,990
Why is there suddenly thunder and lighting?

473
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,260
Love?

474
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,700
What's up?

475
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,910
Why is the weather suddenly like that?

476
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,290
It's Christmas Eve but why the thunder and lightning—

477
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,820
Dislike Cell, find me some memos.

478
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,390
Huh? What memos?

479
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,050
All the dislikes related to dating.

480
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,680
Sorry, there are too many.

481
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,290
Are you talking about this?

482
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,800
"I hate it when my boyfriend thinks another woman is cute!"

483
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,200
- I hate it! I hate it!
- That's right. Give it to me.

484
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,250
Huh? What are you doing?!

485
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,520
As I've lived my life, I've found that a person's feelings don't work like this.

486
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,330
I mean, I ...

487
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:25,630
I really thought I wouldn't see him again.

488
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,300
I'm also so... I'm so confused.

489
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,190
I really ... I...

490
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,410
I...I really like you, Miss Writer.

491
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,570
I'm sorry that I had those kinds of thoughts.

492
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:53,480
I also sometimes think that a man is handsome when I see them.

493
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,630
So I can understand it.

494
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:11,530
Is that a reason for him to move?

495
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,690
Because you confessed your feelings?

496
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,130
That's a really absurd misunderstanding.

497
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,980
Miss Da Eun, you really are very young.

498
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,950
You really are a kid.

499
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,890
Take care.

500
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,670
I'll say goodbye in advance, because I think it will be difficult for us meet again.

501
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,200
It's understandable.

502
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,790
So I'm going to pretend that I don't know.

503
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,820
When did you start liking me?

504
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,520
I don't really remember.

505
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,590
How can you not remember that?

506
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,870
I don't know exactly when it was.

507
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,600
At some point, I just started to care about a woman named Kim Yumi.

508
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,490
I hate it. I hate a boyfriend with a lot of secrets!

509
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,350
Ugh, I hate it!

510
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,770
Wait a second.

511
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,680
- Wear this on your way.
- No, I'm okay! I'm okay.

512
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,860
Wear it. You'll catch a cold like that.

513
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,490
Oh... Thanks.

514
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,780
I really hate a boyfriend that is also sweet to other women.

515
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,860
I can understand everything. Yeah.

516
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,060
Dating isn't always easy.

517
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,290
Hm... You're saying that you really don't hate all of that? You really, really don't?

518
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,870
Yumi is an adult now!

519
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,120
How can she make it in this world, if she hates everything like that?

520
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,780
What kind of man could she date?

521
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,730
Then, should we get rid of this too?

522
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,660
Are you really okay with that?

523
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,460
No, I'm not!

524
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,410
Put this in a frame and hang it up!

525
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,830
All of a sudden?

526
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,340
Yumi! The tree looks so great.

527
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,060
That must have been difficult to do. How did you do it all alone?

528
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,960
We could have done it together when I got here.

529
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,160
Yumi? Did she go out?

530
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,180
The cake is pretty.

531
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,190
Yumi!

532
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,560
The person you have called is unavailable. Leave a message after the beep...
Why isn't she picking up?

533
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,840
Why isn't she answering?

534
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,790
Yumi?

535
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,430
Did she really go out?

536
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,820
The person you have called is unavailable. Leave a message after the beep...

537
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,570
Calling Yumi

538
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,910
Why isn't she answering the phone?

539
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,330
What in the world happened?

540
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,790
Yumi.

541
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,640
What are you doing here? You're not answering the phone either.

542
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,370
Did you lose your cellphone?

543
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,920
No, it's right here.

544
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,100
Then why didn't you answer it?

545
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,110
I was going...

546
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,370
to call you.

547
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,450
I was just about to.

548
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,240
Why did you bring your luggage with you?

549
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,530
Yumi.

550
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,720
Is something wrong?

551
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,840
Ba Bi.

552
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,210
I have something to ask you.

553
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:23,500
Please answer me seriously this time. Don't brush it off with a smile.

554
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,390
What's wrong?

555
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,160
Why did you suddenly decide to move?

556
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,860
I told you earlier.

557
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,740
The commute is too hard, and the airport is far away.

558
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,150
Is it because of Da Eun?

559
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,180
Because Da Eun confessed her feelings to you?

560
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,030
I really hate a boyfriend who gets swayed by another woman even for just a moment.

561
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,960
This one I can't concede to. This one ...

562
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,220
is Yumi's number one dating rule.

563
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,620
Episode 26
The Second Christmas

564
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,570
Bulletin board for the surrounding people

565
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,010
Nice to meet you. I'm Team Leader Yu Ba Bi.

566
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,290
- Nice to meet you. Let's all work well together.
- Hello.

567
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,850
It would be best to take this out.

568
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:45,010
I'm sorry. Sorry.

569
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,350
She seems to make a lot of mistakes.

570
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,280
I'm Yu Da Eun. Hello.

571
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,360
That's right, Miss Yu Da Eun. You live in this neighborhood?

572
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,390
Yes. That tangerine orchard is my house.

573
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,630
I see.

574
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,330
Her name is Yu Da Eun. She lives in the same neighborhood.

575
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,150
She's the daughter of a tangerine orchard owner.

576
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,470
Holiday - Je Hwi

577
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,950
♫ A room without space to take a step ♫

578
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,200
Oh! I love this song!

579
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,970
- Oh, you like this song?
- Yes, I really, really love it!

580
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,120
- She gets excited often.
- Is she that innocent?

581
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,040
See you tomorrow.

582
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,720
You're not getting off work yet?

583
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,810
Please go ahead. I have to finish binding these.

584
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,210
Do it when you come in the morning. It'll be more comfortable for you to ride home in my car.

585
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,460
No. I have to finish this before I go to feel at ease.

586
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,530
- Good luck, then.
- Goodbye.

587
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,830
- She is diligent.
- It's good that she's always bright.

588
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,860
♫ While I'm on my way to collect the heart I left behind ♫

589
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,000
Team Leader!

590
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,620
Good morning! I brought coffee!

591
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,930
Are you all right?!

592
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,720
She makes too many mistakes!

593
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,880
Goodness.

594
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,010
- You have a cut on your chin.
- Huh?

595
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:30,660
Oh, it's okay. Oh no, what a waste of coffee.

596
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,270
She makes too many mistakes!!!

597
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,130
You're happy even though you fell?

598
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,980
- She's uselessly bright.
- She smiles at anything.
- Is she innocent or unreliable?

599
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,830
- I want to take a look inside her head.
- She's really useless.

600
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,340
She's so cute.

601
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,980
What's this? There's a cell who wrote that she's really cute.

602
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,320
They must be crazy! What do they mean cute? He's got Yumi!

603
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,690
Who the heck wrote this?

604
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,350
All right. Everyone get on top of their desk and close their eyes.

605
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,980
Cell that wrote that Da Eun is cute,

606
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,540
raise your hand quietly.

607
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,580
If you turn yourself in right now, I'll be the only one who knows.

608
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,200
There's no one?

609
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,410
Is there really no one?

610
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,530
I'm really disappointed.

611
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,270
You're really not going to tell me?

612
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,600
Well, it's not me.

613
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,580
No one said that it was you, Love.

614
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,840
That's suspicious.

615
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,070
You've only been suspecting me since earlier!

616
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,880
Why are you standing only in front of me?

617
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,130
I told you, it's not me!

618
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,290
The earthquake stopped.

619
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,790
I knew this would happen! I won't let him off easy!

620
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:18,660
I won't let him off easy!

621
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,650
Reason!

622
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,140
Hey, Love!

623
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,650
You said that it's just a small tremor?!

624
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,810
Look at this! The ground is split!

625
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,030
You call this a small tremor?!

626
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,790
We can move away.

627
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,820
What?!

628
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,410
We'll just move house. Then we won't see Da Eun at all.

629
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,250
Then there won't be any earthquakes.

630
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,000
As I thought, you were the culprit!

631
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,860
Why are you doing this?

632
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,180
You're the one who wrote the memo that she was really cute, right?

633
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,780
I just felt that she was cute for a moment!

634
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,300
You just felt that she was cute for a moment?

635
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,980
You're the love cell!

636
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,770
The problem is that the love cell felt that she was cute!

637
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,130
Why did you suddenly decide to move?

638
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,690
I told you earlier.

639
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,380
The commute is too hard, and the airport is far away.

640
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,810
Is it because of Da Eun?

641
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,190
Because Da Eun confessed her feelings to you?

642
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,610
See? Yumi ended up figuring it out.

643
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,350
What are you going to do now?

644
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,270
You said that you thought that she was cute but it was just a momentary feeling, right?

645
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,910
You said the earthquake isn't a big deal, didn't you?

646
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:44,740
Do you want to say that to Yumi, too?

647
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,550
Why would I tell her that?

648
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,950
Why? Yumi's asking!

649
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,110
Do you want to break up with Yumi?

650
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,050
Of course not!

651
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:00,840
Then just pretend you don't know.

652
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,030
I still like Yumi as always.

653
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,430
There's no need to tell her about this feeling, too.

654
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,340
- Ba Bi—
- I don't know what Da Eun told you or how she said it,

655
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,420
but she's an immature young kid.

656
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,600
Don't take what a young kid says to heart.

657
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,080
You're right.

658
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:26,830
But why would you move away because of what an immature young kid said?

659
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,300
Because it's uncomfortable either way.

660
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,380
I might run into her again in the future

661
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,900
and there could be something you might misunderstand, like now.

662
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,000
Is that the only reason?

663
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,020
That's the reason.

664
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,480
Then what about you?

665
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,340
Me?

666
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,110
Yeah.

667
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,690
When Da Eun said that to you,

668
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,190
you weren't swayed at all?

669
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,860
Answer the question below.

670
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,320
Were you swayed when Da Eun said that as she was quitting?

671
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,820
1. Yeah. Truthfully, I was for just a second.

672
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,270
2. No, not at all.

673
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:14,800
It's better to be honest here.

674
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,940
The answer is number one!

675
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,000
You crazy punk!

676
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,780
There's a limit to being honest!

677
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,010
Are you determined to end the relationship?

678
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,890
Who's the one who created this situation?

679
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,400
If you're sorry, you should at least be honest!

680
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,480
I told you that Yumi already caught on to everything!

681
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,410
I just felt that she was cute for a second.

682
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,820
I was only swayed for a moment! It was really just a short moment!

683
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,640
Why are you trying to tell Yumi that?

684
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,200
Yumi is asking!

685
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,190
She's asking him to answer honestly!

686
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,780
Guys, hold on.

687
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,150
We've already got this question wrong!

688
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,020
What?!

689
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,200
This is...

690
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,410
Answer in 0.1 seconds.

691
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:04,340

you end up learning more about yourself than your partner.

I was planning to give it to you tomorrow because it seemed like you forgot about it.

700
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,990
There's something I forgot to tell you when we were on the phone earlier.

701

718
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,180
Total dating period:

719
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,110
One year, one month, 17 days.

720
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:41,020
Yumi's fourth official relationship.

721
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,390
The relationship has end—

722
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,610
That feeling meant nothing.

723
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,720
I didn't tell you because that feeling meant nothing.

724
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,860
And I was going to move

725
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,010
because I was worried that something like this might happen.

726
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,160
I'm sorry for hurting you, Yumi.

727
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,200
But it's in the past.

728
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,610
And really, nothing happened.

729
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:48,610
Nothing happened, really.

730
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,700
Dislike, did you put the memo up from earlier?

731
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,040
Here it is! What do you think?

732
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,240
I made the frame myself and hung it up!

733
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,520
I really hate a boyfriend who gets swayed by another woman even for just a moment.

734
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,330
I did it because the number one rule is really important.

735
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,540
- Wait, what are you doing right now?!
- He's sincerely apologizing.

736
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,150
Throw that away.

737
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,070
What kind of rules are so fickle?

738
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,820
I hate it!

739
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,310
Yumi...

740
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,410
I love you.

741
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,020
I never want to break up with you.

742
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,270
Don't go.

743
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,760
It's an earthquake! An earthquake!

744
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:18,440
Yumi is wavering!

745
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,310
Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up and give the verdict!

746
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,480
You know, you do the slamming thing!

747
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,020
O-o-okay.

748
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:31,810
Even so, it's too late! Ba Bi is guilty!

749
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,740
That's hot!

750
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,460
He told her everything honestly. He's apologetic.

751
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,750
He said that he still loves Yumi as always.

752
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,000
Can't that happen to a person once in their life?

753
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,600
Hey! So you're telling us to forgive him?

754
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,550
How innocent are we?

755
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,400
Can't we understand at least this much?

756
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,350
Isn't giving him at least one more chance the adult thing to do?

757
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,370
Yumi.

758
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,740
Don't leave like this.

759
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,400
Today is

760
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,210
Christmas Eve.

761
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,010
Huh?

762
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,290
Yumi, today's Christmas Eve.

763
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,060
So let's just ...

764
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,100
just ...

765
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,250
let's just pretend we can't win, you guys.

766
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,990
- Although, our heart may be giving in and you all may be confused ...
- Look at that.

767
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,970
Love, more than that, you ...

768
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,230
- There are horns growing on your head.
- Yeah.

769
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,490
And they're getting bigger.

770
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,390
What's happening?

771
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,310
Why do you have horns?

772
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,780
Love, are you okay?

773
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,410
It's a skull!

774
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,790
Yumi. First, let's go home and–

775
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:45,130
Ba Bi.

776
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:53,130
Even if we keep dating like we are now,

777
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,490
I don't think I can treat you the way I used to

778
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,020
as if nothing happened.

779
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,740
Yu Ba Bi was someone really special.

780
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:57,980
He was someone who made my heart flutter the most and someone I dreamed of.

781

♫ When you're about to be caught ♫

782

At the end of a dream-like relationship

788
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,750
Love was left with only rage.

♫  and whisper love ♫

791
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,910
Dating, damn you!

792
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,490
This damned love affair!

793
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,970
I'm telling you it is exasperating!

794
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,490
Love!

795
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,170
That's hot!

796
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,120
Detective! Love is totally crazy!

797
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,510
What do we do now?!

798
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,310
Don't worry. I just found a way.

799
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,460
What is it?

800
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,980
We just need to kick out Love from the prime cell position.

801
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,810
Because Love is the prime cell, she has that strong power.

802
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,530
We need to give the prime cell position to another cell.

803
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:10,900
To whom?

804
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,370
The principle of succession.

805
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:16,020
The cell in the second highest order of current priorities

806
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,720
is promoted as the next prime cell.

807
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,080
Since the love that was in the first position is gone,

808
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,320
the one in the second position who is to succeed as the prime cell is ...

809
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,310
Me? I'm the next prime cell?

810
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,720
Writer is?

811
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,210
Really? I never imagined this.

812
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,680
Says who? I'm the prime cell!

813
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,090
I am Yumi's prime cell!

814
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:57,460
The most important thing to Yumi is me, Love!

815
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,840
If you want to take my position ...

816
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,380
go ahead and try!

817
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,420
Pass it on to her.

818
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,550
Yu-Yumi.

819
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,760
Yumi appeared in the village!

820
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,320
Yumi!

821
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,800
Yumi's here.

822
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:48,580
Love, I know you've been working hard.

823
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,480
Yu-Yumi.

824
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:58,320
But I don't want to live being in a blazing rage.

825
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,080
The reason dating was my number one priority was that I thought that if I were in a relationship,

826
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,660
I would be happy. That's how I decided it.

827
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:14,140
Give the prime cell position to Writer.

828
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,930
Who cares if I'm not in a relationship?

829
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:57,690
What I want is always the same.

830
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:17,020
♫ The day starts as if being shoved ♫

831
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:23,220
♫ I spend the day constantly acting fearless ♫

832
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:29,090
♫ and before I know it the night arrives ♫

833
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:33,160
♫ The dark night ♫

834
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:39,600
♫ The sadness which I've endured all day ♫

835
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,150
I just
♫ arrives like a routine ♫

836
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:48,400
want to be happy.

837
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:54,580
♫ I hide in the middle of nowhere ♫

838
01:04:54,580 --> 01:05:00,390
♫ Pathetically with a thud landing on the floor I am crying ♫

839
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,920
♫ Today too ♫

840
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,980
♫ Dark feelings will be passed tonight ♫

841
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,150

842
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,090
Do you believe in fate?

843
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,970
- What are you talking about?

844
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,130
Ku Woong Games CEO Gu Wung
Hey! Hey! Hey!

845
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,210
- Writer Kim Yumi.
- Try contacting her.

846
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,460
There's no reason to.

847
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,680
Love, are you home?

848
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,290
Do you believe in fate?

849
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,560
Because I really look up to you. Hyeong Wung.

850
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,210
I'm sorry but "My Love Muse" has been sold out.

851
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,940
It's sold out?

852
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,140
Can you give me a ride to the subway station?

853
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,170
Do you believe in fate?
