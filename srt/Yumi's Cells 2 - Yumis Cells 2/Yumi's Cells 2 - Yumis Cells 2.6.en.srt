00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,270
Yumi's Cells 2

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,440
Episode 15
Satisfaction Level

3
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,200
- (Alarm): Wake up!

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,230
Wake up!

5
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,480
Wake up!

6
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,660
Wake up!

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,270
Wake up!

8
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,130
Yumi gets one star as soon as she wakes up in the morning

9
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,110
♫ I don’t even know my own heart ♫

10
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,980
Stars represent satisfaction with life.

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,320
Every morning, she writes two thousand words for her draft novel.

12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,390
And before it becomes lunch time, she gets on a bus.

13
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,940
Ba Bi, what do you think about having mushroom noodles for lunch today?

14
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm sorry, I have a previous engagement.

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,670
Again?

16
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,020
You have lunch plans every day.

17
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Oh, my friend is going to be in the area.

18
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,160
Enjoy your meal.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,950
It feels like he's dating someone.

20
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,970
It's a little suspicious.

21
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,430
Ba Bi!

22
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,030
Did you wait long?

23
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,950
- No, I only got here five minutes ago.
- Lets go in, it's cold.

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,550
If nothing special comes up, Yumi has lunch with Ba Bi.

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,370
But ... are you still going to work every weekend? Until when?

26
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,990
There's no set date yet. Even today the general manager got yelled at by the chairman.

27
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,790
The marketing department is crazy these days. It's good that you quit before.

28
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,710
Yes, I think so too.

29
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,850
Oh, I thought you would comfort me.

30
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,830
Did you think making money would be easy? Suffer a little, Assistant Manager Yu.

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,670
Oh, right. Did I tell you?

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,900
- About Sales Department Assistant Manager Oh?
- Assistant Manager Oh? I thought he was going to the U.S. for training.

33
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,170
It turns out that the training in the U.S. is actually

34
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,470
- because he got scammed by the woman he was supposed to marry.
- Scammed?!

35
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,950
- Oh, my how could you scam someone you're marrying? How—
- Yumi, later ...

36
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,310
Lunchtime is when stars are recharged the most.

37
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,070
- Let's find a better place to eat next time.
- I'll look for some new places.

38
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,180
- I'll go from here.
- What time does today's class end?

39
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,590
- Around 4?
- Then do you want to wait for me? We could go home together.

40
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,860
- I said I'm going to meet my friend today.
- That's right.

41
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,430
- Then I'll call you.
- Yes.

42
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,550
- Bye.
- Bye.

43
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,630
♫ You will understand as you go
There's no way to stop it ♫

44
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,140
♫ I've gone as far as I could ♫

45
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,960
What?

46
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,670
♫ I went as far as I could  ♫

47
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,430
♫ Suddenly I am there ♫

48
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,390
♫ In the place love is ♫

49
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,850
- I'm really going.
- All right, bye!

50
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,660
- Oh, Yumi!
- Ruby.

51
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,720
But what brings you here?

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,740
About that ...

53
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,100
I think I know why you're here.

54
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,300
- That's ...
- You came because you missed Ruby, right?

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,030
Yes.

56
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,470
- Eonni, Ruby missed you too!
- I missed you too. Have you been well?

57
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,370
I haven't, I haven't. Oh! Eonni Yi Da.

58
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,750
- Eonni Yumi is here.
- Kim Yumi!

59
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,640
Lunchtime is when stars are recharged the most.

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,050
But that's also when the risk is highest.

61
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,810
How has everyone been doing? Is everything all right with Section Chief Nam too?

62
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,020
Everyone is the same. It's always the same.

63
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,480
It's really boring.

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,090
But your face is glowing. Are you happy you're not working?

65
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,930
I wish. I have no income and no stable future.

66
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,050
You guys feel like that too?

67
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,750
Since Ruby is a year older,

68
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,470
her heart pounds for no reason

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,740
and when she sees couples who are beautifully in love

70
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,290
- It's nice to see.
- she hates seeing that.

71
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,190
- What are you doing?
- What?

72
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,670
You were so opposed to dating before you quit.

73
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,960
- When did I?
- Are you dating someone?

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,980
What are you saying? Where would I find the time to date?

75
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,680
That's true. Otherwise Ruby would have known about it.

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,650
No, you might not know. How can you know everything?

77
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,310
I guess you two don't know about Ruby's lookout radar.

78
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,950
Do you see Sales department Assistant Manager Yun over there?

79
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,020
- He's been flirting with Eun Hye from the Human Resources department.
- Really?

80
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,070
And the guy behind him is the secretary's boyfriend.

81
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,600
Wow, she said she didn't have a boyfriend.

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,090
They're all secretly dating.

83
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,330
I heard they were seen kissing in the emergency stairwell not that long ago.

84
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,650
- Oh, my!
- It's really crazy!

85
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,910
Wait, but how do you know all that?

86
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,320
It's all the information that comes in.

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,910
All the couples at Daehan Noodle are within my lookout radar.

88
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,740
That's impressive.

89
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,880
Also, this is really recent news, but I'll only tell you two.

90
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,810
What is it?

91
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,890
- I heard Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi has a girlfriend!
- Really?

92
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,950
- Really?
- There are so many rumors!

93
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,270
Oh, really?

94
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,190
- Who is it?
- There's a rumor that it's someone from work.

95
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,500
But my hunch is that it's not someone from work.

96
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,710
There's someone I'm thinking of.

97
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,420
- Oh! The woman he was flirting with and got rejected by?
- No, his ex-girlfriend.

98
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,460
No, it's not!

99
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,500
You scared me. Why are you shouting?

100
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,280
Because that doesn't make sense. Why would he date his ex-girlfriend again?

101
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Last month, someone saw them together.

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
- They eventually–
- They must have gotten back together.

103
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,320
I told you it's not true!

104
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,430
Yumi, how do you know that's not true?

105
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,760
I heard that he has absolutely no feelings leftover for her.

106
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,970
There's no certainty in relationships between men and women.

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,490
That's true. How would we know?

108
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,070
One vote from Ruby that there's going to be wedding invitations going around soon!

109
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,110
It seems like it! That's so unreal!

110
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,120
You should've told me sooner.

111
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,330
I'm jealous.

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,200
- Eonni Yumi, fighting!
- Yumi, let's see each other again.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,660
Work hard. Fighting!

114
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,350
When I find out who Yu Ba Bi's girlfriend is, I'll let you know right away.

115
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,640
Okay.

116
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,640
- We're going.
- Bye!

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,740
Bye!

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,610
In the end, this lunchtime discharged as much as it charged.

119
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,630
There are two ways to make a plot.

120
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,060
Make it with an outline or without an outline.

121
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,800
If you are making it with an outline, it has the advantage of securing certainty from the start.

122
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,530
But if you fall into the trap of the outline,

123
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:57,190
there's also a disadvantage that your ideas can be blocked. Then on the other hand ...

124
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,500
She takes a writing class on weekends in the afternoon.

125
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

126
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,910
After class, she often stops by the neighborhood bookstore.
Sundol Books

127
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,370
After doing what she likes all day and seeing the people she missed,

128
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,200
Yumi filled all five stars that afternoon.

129
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,320
However, when all the stars are filled, anxiety suddenly surges in.

130
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,170
I'm anxious. How long will this happiness last?

131
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,410
We don't have any income.

132
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,810
There's not a lot of money left in our bank account.

133
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,280
What will we do if we're not chosen as one of the winners in the competition this year?

134
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,620
All my colleagues are getting promoted to section chief.

135
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,890
Is it really okay to live like this?

136
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,560
I'm really really anxious!

137
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,060
But still, I get to live doing something I want to do.

138
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,180
That's enough. Things are very good, Kim Yumi.

139
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,530
Enjoy it.

140
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,000
Managing the stars is very important.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,890
Yumi!

142
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,180
Especially when she meets an old classmate, it's even more important.

143
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,890
Ta-da! Yumi, how does it look?

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,500
- Oh, it's pretty!
- Isn't it pretty?

145
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,380
Where did you buy it? It looks expensive.

146
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,180
No, it's cheap. About 2 pounds?

147
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,240
Pound? Did you buy it overseas?

148
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,230
Yes, I bought it while passing through Notting Hill.

149
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,510
Notting Hill ... Are you talking about Notting Hill in England?

150
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,510
I bought it while I was on a business trip in London.

151
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,390
Wow, that's so cool. You even go to London for business trips?

152
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,760
Of course. I usually go to Europe.

153
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,350
For our company, any levels from section chief and up have a lot of business trips.

154
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,200
Section Chief? You got promoted.

155
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,170
Yes, it just happened.

156
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,470
What? Listening to her, she's just bragging!

157
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,860
What kind of bragging is so natural?

158
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,380
Oh, I didn't even give you my business card.

159
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,940
I forgot, I forgot.

160
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,570
It's newly made.

161
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,040
Wow, if you're section chief, then your salary must have increased a lot.

162
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,330
A little?

163
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,900
Wow, you must be so happy, Eun Yi. Congratulations on your promotion.

164
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,360
No, everyone's getting promoted these days.

165
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,140
It's also time for you to get one too. How's work?

166
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,950
Oh, that..

167
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,300
Actually, I quit my job at the end of the year.

168
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,890
What?

169
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,190
You quit your job?

170
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,380
I mean ... Why? Did you get another job?

171
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,080
No, I just quit.

172
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,370
You just quit your job? I mean, what are you going to do?

173
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,960
Well, there are things that I want to learn and stuff.

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,390
Learn what?

175
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,650
Just things I've always wanted to do.

176
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,520
Which is what?

177
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,050
I want to try writing so I'm learning right now.

178
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,040
Write, you mean a novel?

179
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,680
Yes, of course that's if it all works out.

180
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,180
This was such a random piece of news, huh?

181
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,090
Hey, this place is delicious.

182
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,900
So you're unemployed now?

183
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,830
I'm sort of an aspiring writer.

184
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,450
That means you're unemployed.

185
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,790
- Is that so?
- No, Yumi. This is not the time for you to laugh.

186
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,190
I mean, we're not young anymore. We're not in our 20's and you quit your job?

187
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,240
You can learn about writing after you get off work.

188
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,420
I could but

189
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,750
I couldn't completely balance that time out.

190
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,060
But still, what are you going to do?

191
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,990
- What are you going to do now that you've recklessly quit–
- Eun Yi, stop it.

192
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,310
Since you keep saying these things, I'm getting anxious.

193
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm going crazy.

194
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,000
There's suddenly dark clouds!

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,670
I told you I was anxious! Anxious!

196
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,950
Eun Yi is right. We were too reckless!

197
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,720
We could've continued working and taking night classes.

198
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,520
We did something crazy! What are we doing to do!?

199
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,250
We need to do something. Change the subject. Hurry!

200
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,050
Oh, right! Eun Yi, last time you said you were going on a blind date–

201
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,100
Do your parents know? Are they okay with you quitting your job?

202
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,160
They just said to think carefully.

203
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,240
I mean, why do you want to be a writer of all things?

204
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,840
It's so hard to be successful as a writer.

205
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,450
- Did I not tell you about my friend, Seung Ah's sister?
- No.

206
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,040
She wanted to write a novel so she quit her big company job and kept studying until she was forty-five.

207
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,510
Eventually she couldn't even win one competition and got depressed so she's in the hospital right now.

208
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,750
She sold the studio that her parents bought for her. She has no home. She never got married.

209
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,200
She has nothing. That's enough for her to need medicine.

210
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,250
Oh, also. Among my seniors, someone who wanted to be a writer

211
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,640
was preparing to write a horror novel and got haunted by spirits.

212
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,130
You're not writing a horror novel, right?

213
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,360
Eventually, Yumi lost all her stars.

214
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,080
Where am I?

215
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,080
My energy is being drained.

216
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,580
My mind is feeling confused.

217
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,090
Guys, pull yourselves together! We need to take care of Yumi!

218
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,450
Oh, sorry. Let me just send this.

219
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,900
Since I became section chief, there are a lot of things I have to approve.

220
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,030
Am I making a mistake right now?

221
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,810
Without stars, Yumi will quickly become sad.

222
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,320
Talking like this in such a long time was so fun!

223
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,450
- We should see each other more often, Yumi!
- Sure.

224
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,450
Why is the weekend going by so fast?

225
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,530
The weather's supposed to start getting super cold tomorrow.

226
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm already worried about getting to work tomorrow. Aren't you?

227
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,460
Yes, I suppose.

228
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,580
I hate winter the most.

229
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,960
Going to work?

230
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,420
Huh?

231
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,310
I don't have to go to work tomorrow.

232
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,680
Oh, that's right.

233
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,020
Unemployed Yumi doesn't get the Monday blues.

234
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,980
Oh, but look, Eun Yi.

235
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,730
Tomorrow morning the temperature is dropping to -10 degrees.

236
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,210
Oh, no! It's no joke! Make sure to bundle up to go to work, okay?

237
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,650
I don't want to go to work!

238
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,960
Don't talk about it anymore.

239
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,450
- Bundle up, got it? It'll be bad if you get a cold.
- Yes, sure.

240
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,020
Get to work well!

241
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:14,110
Strangely, the theory of relativity applies to her satisfaction level.

242
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Episode 16
Face-Off

243
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,260
Who could that be at this hour?

244
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,340
- Who is it?
- Yumi, it's me.

245
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,120
Why did you come without telling me?

246
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,590
Oh my! What is that?

247
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,760
- That's a pig.
- It's a gift. Take it.

248
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,090
Hurry.

249
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,980
Oh my! Oh my goodness!

250
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,610
Oh my! Thank you!

251
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,780
Why a pig?

252
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,400
It's a dream about a pig. If we dreamt about a pig, isn't it a really good thing?

253
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,700
What kind of dream are you?

254
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,280
I think it's a really good dream*.
(in Korea, dreaming of a pig is considered a sign of good luck)

255
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,460
What might it be? A conception dream?

256
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,730
Tell me. Just tell me a little bit, huh?

257
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,390
Don't be shy.

258
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,470
Are you crazy? Give me the pig.

259
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,770
Dreaming about a pig means there's money coming!

260
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,290
- Let's go buy a lottery ticket!
- No.

261
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,550
It seems like it might mean we achieve something.

262
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,840
What would an unemployed person achieve?

263
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,750
Isn't today the day the winners of the contest are announced?

264
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,650
That's right. The contest.

265
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,010
What if..the pig dream?

266
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,020
Surely not ... There's no way.

267
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,870
No, you never know.

268
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,310
The final results of the Seojin Literature New Writer Contest.

269
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,660
If I win a prize, then I, Kim Yumi,

270
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,480
will really live the rest of my life with kindness.

271
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,040
Kim Yumi. Kim Yumi. Kim Yumi.

272
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,010
Congratulations to the winners of the contest.

Excellence Award: Choi Eun Ji (Dance Leader)

274
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,830
My name isn't there.

275
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,600
My first time entering a competition and my work wasn't picked as one of the winners.

276
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,830
Dig really wide. That way Writer cell

277
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,080
can go right in.

278
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,920
Hey! Are you going to do this after just one failure?

279
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,290
If you tried it once, then that's more than enough.

280
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,830
What more are you trying to do?

281
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,860
Should I have listened to Mom?

282
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,420
Maybe I should've just kept working hard at the job I already had.

283
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,950
"There are no great men."

286
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,250
What the heck? Why did you suddenly get so strong?

287
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,950
I prepared something for a day like this, you punk.

288
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,930
Uplifting quotes make Yumi stronger.

289
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,600
"If you never try, then you will never know what you're capable of!"

290

291

- Denis Diderot.

296
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,790
That's right. This is just the start.

297
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,000
I can't already get disappointed.

298
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,360
It's just the beginning.

299
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,790
The charm of young people is

300
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,720
doing something to achieve their dream!

301

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,560
can possibly find out how far one can go.

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,990
- T.S. Eliot.

Seojin Literature New Writer Contest

306
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,100
Yumi, what are you doing?

307
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,260
I'm at home, where are you ?

308
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,130
Should we meet for a bit today?

309
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,920
I think I'm going to go home right after my meeting.

310
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,080
Ba Bi, I'm not sure.

311
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,180
I need to finish up what I'm writing now. I have to submit it by today.

312
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,630
I see. Then go ahead and write.

313
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,630
After 7 is okay. I think I will be done by then.

314
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,510
Seven o'clock.

315
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,550
Then should I buy something to eat and head there? To save time.

316
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,100
Sounds good.

317
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,120
Ba Bi!

318
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,760
- Are you done writing?
- Yes. Come in.

319
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,440
My boyfriend is here.

320
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,260
Yumi, you live with your parents?

321
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,010
Yes, didn't I tell you ?

322
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,950
♫ Today too because my day ♫

323
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,410
I was joking.
♫ approaches slowly. ♫

324
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,270
You were scared.

325
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,980
♫ I didn't even expect this ♫

326
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,500
Kim Yumi.
♫ You're playing a joke. ♫

327
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,900
But you really came right on time at 7 p.m.
♫ Why of all days ♫

328
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,840
Actually,
♫  this morning ♫

329
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,990
I came at 6:50

330
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,140
but I waited ten minutes outside.
♫ without any preparation ♫

331
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,940
- Why? You should have come in.
- I thought I would distract you from writing.

332
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,770
Mr. Yu Ba Bi, do you really not have any flaws?
♫ why did you leave the room? ♫

333
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,880
You're even considerate.
♫ I thought about it for a long time ♫

334
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,580
I brought some bento boxes, the one you like.
- What is it?

335
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,360
Jehyukssambap*
(Stir-fried spicy pork with rice)

336
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,820
♫ It's not about something I can understand ♫

337
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,780
I guess the dream was right. You really did bring pork.

338
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,440
It's nothing. Wow, this looks delicious.

339
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,680
But ...
♫ so I can feel  ♫

340
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,540
We planned to see each other tomorrow.
♫ your love love love. ♫

341
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,560
You're here to comfort me, aren't you?

342
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,430
- Comfort you for what?
- Didn't you contact me because I failed the writing contest?

343
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,810
You didn't win? I didn't know.

344
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,380
You're pretending not to know.

345
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,610
I really didn't know, though.

346
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,490
But isn't it understandable for your first time?

347
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,240
You're not disappointed, are you?

348
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,010
Of course not. My combat skill has increased.

349
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,670
Good.

350
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,790
- But you're a bowl of rice today?
- Huh?

351
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,040
Your bangs.
(His haircut is a "rice bowl")

352
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,940
Ahhh! I came in a hurry.

353
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,410
What's the hurry?

354
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,560
In case you'd change your mind.

355
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,890
So naughty.

356
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,820
♫ I wish someone lives there  ♫

357
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,670
♫ For so many questions ♫

358
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,100
♫ let me tell you the answers. ♫

359
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,060
It's too bright.

360
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,550
I can't use my strength when it's too bright.

361
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,190
I want to be more naughty!

362
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,710
What? Turn the lights off?

363
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,230
Okay. Leave it to us.

364
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,260
Right Hand, can you do it?

365
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,020
Of course!

366
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,430
I'll turn off the lights and come back.

367
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,650
Yumi is kissing right now, so she has her eyes closed.

368
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,260
Is it possible without any visibility?

369
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,970
It is. In the dark, not only can we plug in a cord

370
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,990
but we can even plug in a USB.

371
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,420
This isn't hard.

372
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,560
For Yumi!

373
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,410
Is it here? There? Oh, it's here.

374
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,180
Success!

375
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,790
You are the best, Right Hand!

376
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,550
Who could that be?

377
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,910
Someone seems to be here.

378
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,570
Who would be here at this hour?

379
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,960
Could it be my dad?

380
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,110
You're joking again.

381
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,780
My dad did say he is coming to Seoul today.

382
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,150
Who is it?

383
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,130
Yumi, it's your dad.

384
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,810
What are you doing? Hurry and open the door!

385
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,570
Dad.

386
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,460
Dad is here, Yumi.

387
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,880
What happened? You said you weren't dropping by Ilsan.

388
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,470
It's because

389
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,290
- Grandma packed so much stuff to give to you.
- Really?

390
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,290
I brought kimchi and oysters.

391
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,850
- Do you have space in your fridge?
- There is, but ...

392
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,290
She thought you wouldn't have enough to eat after quitting your job,

393
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,280
so she packed so much.

394
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,220
Because you like oyster pancakes, so ...

395
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,930
Aigoo.

396
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,740
Hello, nice to meet you.

397
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,620
Wh-Wh-Who are you? Wh-Wh-Who are you?

398
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,840
I am Yu Ba Bi.

399
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,060
Dad, he is my boyfriend.

400
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,480
Yumi's boyfriend?

401
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,460
Hey. Think about Yumi's age.

402
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,980
She's an adult. She's not a young girl.

403
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,340
He works at Daehan Noodle.

404
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,180
We were in the same marketing department.

405
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,440
- I told you, right? My dad isn't scary at all.
- Huh?

406
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,300
Yes, yes.

407
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,120
Dad, be careful of your back.

408
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,700
Right, I am an open-minded dad.

409
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,390
- Open-minded ... 
- Nice to meet you, I am Yumi's dad.

410
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,190
Nice to meet you.

411
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,900
Cram all of my power into it!

412
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,840
It's a handshake of fury? How's that, punk?

413
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,760
The handshake of fury: A formidable technique used

414
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,970
when you don't like someone but you can't tell him outright.

415
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,460
We are in trouble, I think his hand is going to break.

416
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,100
Shouldn't we fight back?

417
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,300
If we leave him like this, we might lose the right hand forever.

418
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't overreact. Right now, he just needs to bear it.

419
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,960
His hand is going numb.

420
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,490
He is Yumi's father. Her father!

421
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,740
Don't you know it's the end if you ruin the first impression!

422
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,040
Ba Bi! Smile as you endure!

423
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,750
Are you going to shake hands all day?

424
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,050
I'm just glad to meet him.

425
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,640
You should wash your hands first. Your hands smell like oysters.

426
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,780
- Should I?
- That way!

427
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,980
Ba Bi, this is my mom.

428
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,480
Are you Yumi's boyfriend?

429
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,240
Yes, hello, I am Yu Ba Bi.

430
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,780
Nice to meet you. I am Yumi's mother.

431
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,090
You are so handsome.

432
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,700
I thought you were a celebrity.

433
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,840
Thank you.

434
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,160
We didn't know that you were here and barged in like this.

435
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,900
I'm sorry. It's awkward, right?

436
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,420
No, not at all.

437
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,560
Our Yumi doesn't talk about her boyfriend at all.

438
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,550
But then, I can talk comfortably, right?

439
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,360
Of course. Please treat me comfortably.

440
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,840
- Should I?
- Yes.

441
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:15,250
Oh! But you are so attractively tall and handsome.

442
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,020
Thank you. You are too kind.

443
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,390
My goodness.

444
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,290
What? Why her mom's tone like that?

445
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,080
I'm anxious!

446
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,990
What if mom goes overboard

447
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,490
and calls Ba Bi "Son-in-law Yu"?

448
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,550
I'm scared.

449
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,480
She can't do that! Surely not.

450
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,210
Mom, please!

451
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,970
First, let's get Ba Bi out of here.

452
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,600
Oh, Mom, but Ba Bi is busy, so I think he has to go now.

453
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,670
- Earlier ...
- Yumi, prepare some fruit.

454
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,210
You have fruits here, right?

455
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,610
We can't.

456
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,630
As a daughter, Yumi can defeat her mom

457
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,530
but right now she is set on girlfriend mode.

458
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,350
Have a seat.

459
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,270
- First, this.
- That's all right.

460
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,730
Yumi's dad will do that. Sit. Sit down.

461
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,830
You said your name was Ba Bi, right?

462
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,330
Yes. It's Yu Ba Bi.

463
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,200
Ah, yes.

464
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,740
You haven't eaten yet, right?

465
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,280
We were just about to.

466
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,340
- Really?
- Yes.

467
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,780
Then you should have some seafood with us here.

468
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,150
Yumi can't make a single move in front of Mom right now

469
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,560
because she doesn't want to show Ba Bi her "daughter mode".

470
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,120
Yumi! Ba Bi said that he's going to eat dinner here before he leaves.

471
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,700
What are you saying? I told you that Ba Bi's busy.

472
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,030
No. He says that he is free. And he hasn't eaten dinner.

473
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,020
We brought a lot of oysters, abalones, and octopus, all your favorite seafood.

474
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Honey! Ba Bi said he's going to eat dinner with us before he leaves. Isn't that great?

475
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,690
Really?

476
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,360
No, no. I don't have to.

477
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,110
I feel like I'll be intruding, so I'll take my leave.

478
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,540
You should eat before you go. You must, all right?

479
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,710
Our Mr. Yu Ba Bi.

480
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,290
Yes. All right then, I'll eat before I leave.

481
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,050
Is it okay for us to eat here? Really?

482
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:27,540
Yumi's father looks like a former boxer.

483
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,810
We won't get beaten to death while we're eating, right?

484
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,670
Yeah, that's it!

485
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,140
If you've done a takedown— That's right! Go for the low kick!

486
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,800
Low kick! Then takedown! That's it!

487
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,710
Pound! Pound! Pound! Knock out!

488
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,640
Knock out. Yes! Yes!

489
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,190
Do you do any kind of exercise?

490
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,320
Yes. I run as a hobby.

491
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,590
- Running?
- We got close while exercising together in the park.

492
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,850
Then how many hours does it take for you to finish a marathon?

493
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,550
What's important about that?

494
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,350
It's important to me.

495
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,510
I finished a half marathon in two hours before.

496
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,930
Then do you know how to swim?

497
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,820
Yes, I can freestyle.

498
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,980
Who doesn't know how to swim freestyle?

499
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,340
I also know how to do the backstroke, breaststroke, and the butterfly stroke too.

500
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,210
- How many pull-ups can you do?
- About twenty in one go.

501
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,530
- What about pushups?
- I can do 50 in one minute.

502
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,080
- What about sit-ups?
- 60 in one minute.

503
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,150
- Running 100 meters?
- 13 seconds.

504
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,530
- Bench presses?
- 100 kilograms.

505
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,540
You can lift that much?

506
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,640
Omo! Goodness, you're good at exercising too!

507
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,600
I see there's nothing that you can't do.

508
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,120
I don't know why this isn't opening.

509
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,050
- Mom, I'll do it.
- No.

510
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,100
Ba Bi! Will you help me with this?

511
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Sure.

512
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,550
- I don't know why this isn't working.
- I'll do it.

513
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,230
- It won't open. Yumi, you have scissors, right?
- Yes.

514
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,920
Right, it would work if we used scissors.

515
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,640
Move out of the way. Move.

516
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,310
Why can't you even open this?

517
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,760
I can't do it because the tape is overlapping.

518
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,740
- Dad, I found the scissors—
- I don't need that! I can get it.

519
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,890
- Dad, please just use these scissors!
- Just hold on.

520
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,160
Oh, Honey! Honey, your blood pressure will go up!

521
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,160
- Honey, stop!
- Dad.

522
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,370
- Damn it! Hold on.
- Wait!

523
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,380
Oh no!

524
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,290
- Honey! Are you okay, Honey?
- It's done now.

525
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,420
Hey!

526
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,200
What's the point of you being able to bench press 100 kilos when you can't even open this one thing?

527
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,760
Damn.

528
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,650
You completely destroyed the box. What in the world are you doing?

529
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,370
- Have some more of this.
- Thank you.

530
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,380
It's been so long since I've had abalone and octopus. I'm so happy!

531
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,240
Eat up.

532
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,100
- Ba Bi, you eat a lot too!
- Yes.

533
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,750
Yumi must be good at cooking because she takes after you, Mother.

534
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,120
Mother?

535
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,590
Well, is there anything that you can't eat?

536
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,210
No, I'm not picky. I can eat pretty much anything.

537
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,040
- You say that you're not picky, but I guess you don't eat sea cucumber or sea squirt, huh?
- Pardon?

538
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,830
But you haven't moved your chopsticks ("jeotgarak")  toward the sea cucumber (jjoguro) or sea squirt.

539
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,170
Why, is the pun really bad?

540
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:15,050
Oh, really? You should tell us if you can't eat it.

541
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,450
Ba Bi is making bibimbap with the sea squirt and eating it, though.

542
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,080
I like all kinds of seafood.

543
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,360
Goodness, why are you picking a fight with someone who's enjoying his food?

544
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,880
Then, what about spoon worms?

545
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,140
- He's eating some right now.
- What about tripe?

546
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,390
It tastes nutty and delicious when you dip it in sesame seed oil.

547
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,770
- Then what about skatefish?
- That's my favorite food.

548
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,780
Damn it.

549
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,020
You look like a young prince, so I was worried that you'd be a picky eater.

550
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,600
But you really can eat anything!

551
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,320
Wow, how wonderful!

552
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,830
I'm not picky and can eat anything too!

553
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,430
And that's why your stomach is sticking out so much.

554
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,530
Dad, hurry up and eat.

555
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,260
I thought Mom would be the problem, but Dad's even more problematic!

556
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,390
Shouldn't we tell him to quit it and stop him?

557
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:16,960
I'm worried about how far overboard he'll go!

558
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,300
Mother, I'll do the dishes.

559
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,650
Oh, no! No, leave it. Leave it.

560
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,980
No. I enjoyed the food so much, so I should at least do the dishes.

561
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,070
Wow, how can you have such good manners too?

562
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,570
If it were up to me, I'd call you Son-in-law Yu...

563
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,750
Yumi, let's have some coffee and clean up, shall we?

564
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,430
Yumi! Yumi!

565
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,850
Yes?

566
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,120
- What's wrong, Dad?
- This shelf is shaky.

567
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,600
- It's shaky?
- Yes.

568
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,380
It's dangerous to just leave it like this. Bring me the tools.

569
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,290
It's all right. I'll call a handyman later.

570
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:06,370
Bring me the tools. Why would you call someone else when your dad is here? Bring them to me, quickly!

571
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,980
- All right then. Be careful!
- I will.

572
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,540
Man, this thing...

573
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,410
Father, I'll do it.

574
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,960
- Why?!
- Pardon?

575
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,530
Why should you be the one to do this too, Yu Ba Bi?! I'm right here, so why?

576
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,490
Who am I? Do you even know who I am? Who am I?!

577
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,600
- Yumi's father.
- I'm the owner of Yumi's Hardware Store.

578
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,760
The owner of Yumi's Hardware Store that opened the year that our Yumi was born!

579
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,330
The owner of a hardware store is saying that he'll fix his daughter's shelf,

580
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,790
so why are you trying to butt in on that?!

581
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,690
Ah, I'm sorry.

582
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,280
Dad! What's wrong?

583
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,290
Do you think you can fix everything just because you can run 100 meters in 13 seconds and bench press 100 kilos?

584
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,670
People who haven't tried this before can't even do it!

585
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,830
Do you think just anyone can use these tools? These tools are so sensitive and—

586
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,590
- Dad!
- Father!!!

587
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,280
- Dad! Dad!
- Are you all right?

588
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,360
- Dad fell over!
- Oh, no!

589
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,950
Honey! I knew this would happen!

590
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,250
- You've been overreacting and overdoing it all night!
- Wait just a second. Wait!

591
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,700
I think my back went out.

592
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,390
- Oh, no!
- Dad!

593
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,420
- Ow, no!
- Oh no!

594
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,370
Stretch your legs out!

595
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,520
Yumi's Hardware

596
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,770
Father, please just bear with it a little longer.

597
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,370
Aigoo.

598
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,330
Wait, where are you going? The car is right here.

599
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,970
I'll take you there in my car. My car is over there.

600
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,510
- Huh?
- Yes.

601
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,430
No, wait.

602
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,530
Please just bear with it a little longer. The hospital is close by.

603
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,120
About the shelf...

604
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,920
Please fix it for me. It's dangerous.

605
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,980
Yes, I understand.

606
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,680
- Am I heavy?
- No, I'm all right.

607
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,030
I can bench press 100 kilos.

608
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,670
I also

609
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,590
did that when I was young.

610
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,560
That day, Yumi's father finally accepted that he was 60 years old

611
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,390
and accepted Ba Bi as his daughter's boyfriend.

612
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:50,610
Episode 17
The Great Adventure

613
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,960
Yumi's Hardware

614
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,540
- Ow, ow!
- Stop being such a crybaby!

615
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,650
Do it slowly! Take it slow! Why are you doing that?

616
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,950
You already got a shot, so what are you complaining about hurting for?

617
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,920
I'm saying that it hurts because it hurts!

618
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,940
Why did you make such a big fuss at our first meeting?!

619
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,890
- I'm too embarrassed to even look at Ba Bi, seriously.
- Ow!

620
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,490
It's your own fault you're hurting.

621
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,360
Where do you think you're sitting? Wait a second, ouch!

622
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,020
Why are you saying it's all my fault every time you say something?

623
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,980
I need to call Yumi.

624
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,080
Damn it.

625
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,000
Because of that fool Ba Bi or whatever, I'm seriously...

626
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,890
Hey, Mom. Did you make it home safely? What about Dad?

627
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,570
Dad's all right. He's being a big crybaby.

628
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,520
Don't worry about me and just do what you have to do.

629
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,290
How's Ba Bi?

630
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,180
- He's fixing the shelf.
- Huh?

631
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,290
No, I mean, he said that Dad asked him to fix the shelf.

632
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,810
So he's busy right now.

633
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,890
Oh, my goodness. How could he... How could he be like that?

634
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,920
I wasn't going to visit you because I didn't even want to see your face after you quit your job,

635
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,050
but I've forgiven you.

636
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,040
You managed to pick a good man, even though you quit your job.

637
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,960
Wait, Mom. Don't you think you focus too much only on how a man looks?

638
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,000
Hey, would I have married your dad if I was just focused on men's looks?

639
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,950
- That's true.
- I like his personality.

640
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,350
He's polite, proper and very courteous.

641
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,300
There's nothing bad about him.

642
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,210
Your dad is also not saying anything.

643
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,560
That's a relief.

644
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,700
He's charming.

645
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,710
You're right.

646
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,690
And also, it seems like his family is well-bred.

647
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,330
- Family?
- Yes.

648
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,910
I heard his dad runs a business.

649
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,960
He does? I didn't hear about that.

650
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,610
He said so earlier.

651
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,500
He said his dad runs a business.

652
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,300
You talked so much without me.

653
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,330
He says it's a small business.

654
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,600
But the fact that he's dripping with elegance...

655
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,510
According to my gut feeling, he's a rich family's young master.

656
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,130
No, wait. It's true that he's very elegant, but...

657
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,210
No he's not.

658
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,690
He's never said anything like that.

659
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,540
That's why his personality is good. He doesn't brag about being rich.

660
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,120
Find out what his family does.

661
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,640
Forget it. As if what his father does is important.

662
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,420
It is! Why not? Look at this girl talk.

663
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,150
Yumi!

664
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,190
I think he's done. Ba Bi is calling me.

665
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,370
- I will call you again later.
- Oh, yes, sure.

666
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,910
Yumi, now it won't budge even if you put something heavy.

667
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,430
That's nice. You've worked hard.

668
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,410
What about your dad? Did he arrive?

669
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,150
Yeah. He's fine.

670
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,280
He got some shots and it seems like he's not in pain anymore.

671
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
That's a relief.

672
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,100
You really scored big time with my mom.

673
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,440
- Really?
- That's right!

674
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,400
She says "Ba Bi is the best!"

675
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,430
That's a relief.

676
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,280
Earlier, you were in a tough spot because my mom asked a lot of weird questions, right?

677
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,090
No, not at all. As a mom, she can ask those questions.

678
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:17,260
Hey, isn't my boyfriend perfect?

679
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,140
How could it be?

680
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,100
You're teasing me.

681
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,330
Oh, right. Ba Bi, you see, my mom...

682
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,300
Yeah?

683
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,600
Nuna

684
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,280
- Huh?
- No, answer the call first.

685
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,170
Just a sec.

686
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,960
Hi, Nuna?

687
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,800
I will call you back later.

688
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,230
Ahh... I was busy yesterday.

689
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,750
Nuna, stop talking about that.

690
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,210
I told you I have no intentions of taking over for dad.

691
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:02,250
That's what dad thinks. I like the way it is now.

692
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,570
And please, can you please not use the term 'heir'?

693
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,020
Heir?

694
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,030
He did say heir for sure. What's going on?

695
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,850
Is this your father?

696
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:21,890
Yeah.

697
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,210
Wait! He's so cool.

698
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,420
And he looks like you.

699
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,710
That's not something I like to hear.

700
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:32,280
Why?

701
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,980
To be honest, I don't really like my father.

702
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,050
Why?

703
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,080
Look at this. This was when I went on a camping trip.

704
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,840
The weather looks really nice, right?

705
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,590
Yeah.

706
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,510
Perhaps, is he living alone because they don't have a good relationship?

707
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,100
He didn't want to receive his father's help?

708
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,720
That must be it!

709
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,780
No way. That can't be.

710
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,620
If that is real, then what do we do going forward?

711
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,760
It would be too burdensome to date him.

712
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,100
If you want to know for sure, do the yogurt test.

713
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,950
Yogurt test?

714
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,230
Yeah! Yogurt test.

715
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,510
If he licks the cover of the yogurt then he's an ordinary man.

716
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,960
If he just throws it away then he's an heir.

717
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,370
That is the best way to distinguish between the rich from the ordinary person.

718
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,660
Please say something that makes sense, you dummy!

719
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:35,690
You too are pathetic for giving that idea.

720
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,580
And we are more pathetic for acting it out.

721
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,970
- Ba Bi!
- Yes?

722
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:47,350
There's some yogurt, do you want one?

723
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,140
I'd love one.

724
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,920
Thank you.

725
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,800
It's starting! Yogurt test!

726
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,820
Wait! What are you guys doing?

727
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,520
Are you going to lick the lid in front of Ba Bi?

728
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,950
Aren't you even embarrassed in front of Ba Bi?

729
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,780
I am not ashamed of this!

730
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,870
It's not okay to use a spoon either!

731
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,700
You know what my personality is like, right?

732
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,030
Look at this Yu Ba Bi! This is Yumi!

733
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,520
An ordinary person who even licks the lid.

734
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,320
What? Didn't you say he's an heir if he throws away the lid?

735
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,330
I, Hunger, prove that

736
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,030
Yu Ba Bi is

737
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,350
the heir to a rich family!

738
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,630
I ate so much for dinner but I am still really hungry.

739
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,920
Aigoo. Is it because I carried your dad on my back and ran?

740
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,310
Should we buy something to eat?

741
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,840
Yumi. What are you thinking about?

742
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,430
Ba Bi.

743
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:32,290
I'm sorry but I overheard you talking on the phone.

744
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,860
Huh?

745
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,580
Can I ask what that talk about an heir was?

746
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,240
So you found out in the end.

747
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,060
It's true that my dad has picked me among my siblings to be the heir.

748
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,490
But I have no intentions of inheriting the business.

749
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,770
My father and I don't have the same business philosophy either.

750
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,590
I like the job I have now.

751
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,230
Can I just share that much?

752
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,990
Oh! Sure.

753
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,990
All right.

754
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,520
I will go and buy something. I'm really hungry.

755
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,890
What do you want to eat?

756
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,590
Anything. Whatever you want to eat.

757
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,140
Got it. I will be right back.

758
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,320
It was real?

759
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,560
He's a real heir.

760
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,040
So Ba Bi was a rich family's young master who hates his dad.

761
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,860
Right! No wonder!

762
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,080
All the conditions were so perfect for a male protagonist in a romance novel.

763
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,500
I am getting an inspiration.

764
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,750
It's all flowing in!

765
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,110
From that moment on, in her mind she started to film a drama

766
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,630
and things started to get crazy.

767
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,210
Ready, action!

768
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,620
Role of Yumi: Stingy

769
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,930
Role of Ba Bi's Dad: Sensitivity

770
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,490
Take this

771
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,720
and break up with Ba Bi!

772
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:32,970
Cut! Cut!

773
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,320
Hey, Yumi! How could you count the money?
Producer: Writer cell

774
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,780
What are you doing now?

775
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,690
Don't you have any pride?

776
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,290
It's just that I was curious how much it was.

777
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,780
Do it according to the script!

778
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,920
I'm sorry.

779
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,360
Once you get the envelope then you rip it!

780
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,020
Got it?

781
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,340
All right.

782
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,460
Yumi Film
Yumi's cells

783
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,670
Take this

784
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,910
and break up with Ba Bi!

785
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,280
No! I don't need this!

786
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,380
If you knew the amount, you probably wouldn't be able to rip it.

787
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,610
How much is it?

788
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,700
I knew you'd do that.

789
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,100
Take this and break up with Ba Bi.

790
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,740
I'm sorry but you are not a good fit for Ba Bi.

791
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,740
He might be rebelling and living on his own,

792
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,710
but eventually he will be the heir of this family.

793
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,020
I'm sorry.

794
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,780
I can't break up with Ba Bi.

795
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,830
Are you ignoring what I'm saying?

796
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:51,140
Are you saying that a daughter of a hardware store owner is going to marry my son?

797
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,310
This isn't about a hardware store and a family business.

798
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,090
This is about Ba Bi and I.

799
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,460
Father, I—

800
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,160
How dare you call me father?

801
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:14,050
How dare you try to get into our family!

802
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,600
When you're the unemployed daughter of a hardware store owner.

803
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,050
Do you think your mother and father are on par with my family?

804
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,560
Right, right!

805
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,830
The emotion is good.

806
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,900
Right! That's it!

807
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,220
It's my first time seeing Writer work so hard.

808
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:38,970
I think she seems more of a writer for dramas than for novels.

809
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,520
What do I do?

810
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,740
What do I do now?

811
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:49,420
How can I continue dating Ba Bi when it's so burdensome?

812
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:52,730
Who is it?

813
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,380
Yumi! It's me, the heir.

814
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,030
I was gone long, right? I had to go a bit far.

815
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,380
I see.

816
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,460
I suddenly really wanted to eat tteokbokki.

817
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,830
You like tteokbokki, right?

818
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,370
Of course.

819
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:30,960
Try it. It's from the most famous restaurant in my old neighborhood.

820
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,610
I think you'll be surprised when you try it.

821
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,580
Yumi, take a look.

822
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,840
Huh?

823
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,970
Look at the restaurant name.

824
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,120
Ba Bi's Street Food?
30 years of traditional tteokbokki

825
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,640
Oh my.

826
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,950
It's funny, right?

827
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,420
Yumi's Hardware, Ba Bi's Street Food.

828
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,820
I know.

829
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,990
Of all things, how could a restaurant's name be Ba Bi's Street—

830
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,040
I just thought of something. I got a hunch.

831
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,490
Ba Bi ... Are you ...

832
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:12,160
Did you finally realize? I'm the heir to a tteokbokki restaurant.

833
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,100
You're not disappointed that I'm not the second generation of a conglomerate that you imagined–

834
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,730
How– How could this be?

835
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:24,200
My boyfriend is the son of a tteokbokki restaurant owner. How perfect can this be?

836
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,890
Isn't this irony of disappointment?

837
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,710
No. I'm really happy!

838
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:30,580
You're the successor to a tteokbokki restaurant.

839
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,510
You might be even happier when you try it, because it's so good.

840
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,200
What a relief.

841
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,450
- Is it?
- Yes.

842
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,250
Right Hand you can do it this time too, right?

843
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,810
Of course, leave it to me.

844
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,760
I succeeded. For Yumi!

845
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,460
Right Hand, who successfully turned off the light ...

846
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,770
Instead of returning, went off track

847
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,160
and began to act on his own.

848
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,470
Right Hand, what are you doing right now? Come back!

849
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,540
Leave him be.

850
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,050
He's doing good.

851
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:07,340
Look where Right Hand is facing.

852
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:13,570
That guy is headed for Ba Bi's spinal canyon.

853
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,420
He's trying to track the canyon.

854
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,030
Track the canyon?

855
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,140
Right now, Right Hand is

856
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:32,690
a brave guy who does what he needs to do without Yumi knowing.

857
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:35,770
Involuntarily. It refers to cells acting independently

858
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:39,380
without Yumi's orders.

859
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,970
What's wrong with Right Hand? Why isn't he moving?

860
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,040
Hurry and move forward! Everyone's waiting!

861
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,270
Hold on!

862
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,900
That's the octopus hug.

863
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,200
Octopus hug?

864
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,920
Right Hand is stuck in Ba Bi's octopus hug.

865
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,400
Now it's impossible to get to the spinal canyon.

866
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,430
Right Hand, can you hear me? Come back.

867
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,800
If Right Hand is tied up now, we're in trouble!

868
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,520
I can't go back.

869
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,900
Even the way back–

870
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:35,010
But I see a big planet nearby.

871
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,600
A nearby planet?

872
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,800
Why don't we land here first?

873
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,570
Over.

874
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,350
That's ... Don't tell me ...

875
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,980
That's planet H2!

876
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,140
Hold on. Hold on, is this the right order?

877
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,260
Can we land?

878
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,400
Don't you think it's too early?

879
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,190
Why is it a big deal? What's that planet H2 over there?

880
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,870
- The left buttocks.
- Buttocks?!

881
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,570
Opportunity comes in times of crisis.

882
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:16,940
Right Hand, don't miss this chance. Land immediately.

883
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,630
Got it. I will try to land.

884
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,280
Don't forget.

885
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:31,360
Everyone is watching your great adventure.

886
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,400
You guys! Won't you get it together after failing the contest?

887
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,790
We have to hurry and sleep, so we can write again tomorrow.

888
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:53,130
What the heck are you doing not sleeping–

889
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:57,050
This is a historic moment. Don't say anything.

890
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,130
This is Right Hand. This is Right Hand.

891
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,710
Right Hand, where is your current location?

892
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,630
This is planet H2.

893
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:12,210
We successfully landed.

894
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,710
That's right!

895
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,940
He did it! He did it!

896
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,990
I'm so happy I could die.

897
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,610
February 2022.

898
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:29,880
Right Hand cell singlehandedly landed on planet H2.

899
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,330
This great day will be remembered in the history of her relationship with Ba Bi.

900
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,400
Reason, wake up.

901
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,230
What is it? Today is Saturday.

902
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:12,730
I think Yumi might look ugly right now.

903
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,030
I think she's going to look like a mess because it's the morning.

904
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:21,350
I want to check the condition of her face.

905
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,860
Her phone must be behind Ba Bi.

906
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,060
Can you show me her face with that?

907
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,150
I can't reach it.

908
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,770
Try to get closer. Be careful not to wake Ba Bi up.

909
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,960
What are you guys doing right now?

910
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,980
I can't stop you.

911
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:03,360
You guys are all busy first thing in the morning.

912
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,370
What kind of thoughts are you having?

913
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:09,800
Yahoo! I can't stop now.

914
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,750
Then from now on ...

915
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:16,020
What's wrong with him? Let's put him to sleep with a poison needle.

916
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,340
♫ I love that smile ♫

917
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,730
You're going to put me to sleep right now? Me? Naughty?

918
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,920
Shut up!

919
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,180
It's the morning!

920
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,040
♫ The shy tremulous voice ♫

921
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,760
♫ The sunny weather on the street ♫

922
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,120
It worked. He's asleep!

923
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,620
He's not dead? Hey, breathe.

924
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,190
Hey, breathe.

925
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,120
Hurry and check your face to see how it looks.

926
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,170
♫ The small stars which bloom all surround you Oh ♫

927
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,590
♫ I have something to tell you ♫

928
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:53,750
♫ I want to carefully come up to you ♫

929
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:56,250
♫ and whisper ♫

930
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:00,760
See. Your face is swollen and a mess.

931
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,880
You have to wash your face before Ba Bi wakes up.

932
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,550
The house is a mess too. Let's clean up before Ba Bi wakes up.

933
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,630
♫ Everything becomes love ♫

934
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,220
♫ Oh Everything becomes love ♫

935
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,270
♫ I wandered the universe I found my earth ♫

936
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:19,380

01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,850
♫ Wanna know all about you ♫

938

♫ To the point where there's no gap ♫

939
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:29,030
♫ Fill me up fully with you ♫

940
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,820
Yumi.
♫ 'Cause you're beautiful ♫

941
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,660
Did I wake you? Sorry.

942
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:39,120
I'm going to make coffee, so sleep a bit longer.

943
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,190
♫ I'm falling for you ♫

944
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,610
♫ When I fall in love with you ♫

945
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,430
It's Saturday. Sleep a bit more.
♫ In my dreams which blossom ♫

946
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,980
♫ You're there Oh ♫

947
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,600
♫ I have something to tell you
I want to carefully come up to you ♫

948
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,580
♫ And whisper ♫

There are mornings where she has five stars from the moment she opens her eyes.

950
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,310
♫ The moment our eyes met and captured each other ♫

951
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,380
♫ Everything becomes love ♫

952
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,820
♫ Oh everything becomes love ♫

953
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,120
♫ I wandered the universe I found my earth ♫

954
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,780
♫ You were heaven ♫

955
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,400
♫ Because I don't know sometimes, I become impatient ♫

956
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,990
♫ Show me how you feel ♫

957
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:30,230
♫ My heart is about to explode ♫

958
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,730
♫ When I'm next to you ♫

959
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:37,980
♫ Everything is made to match you ♫

960
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,130
♫ Everything about you ♫

961
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,060
♫ oh everything about you ♫
