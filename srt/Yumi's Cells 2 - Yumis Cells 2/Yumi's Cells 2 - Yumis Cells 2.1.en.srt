Yumi's Cells 2

00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,190
Episode 1
Cool Goodbyes

3
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,550
End the relationship

4
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,090
Yumi

5
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,110
I thought about it a lot

6
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,320
and I think we should end it here.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
All right, we should.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,020
I feel the same.

9
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,760
Where are you going?

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
I have to stop by somewhere.

11
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,900
I'll get going then.

12
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,520
All right.

13
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,640
Is the end like this?

14
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,490
There isn't anything more?

15
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,940
The end? Is that the real end?

16
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,380
Is this where it ends?

17
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,450
He left. He really left.

18
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,550
Then can Yumi go home now too?

19
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,820
But did it really end like that? As if it were nothing?

20
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes, it's the end.

21
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,160
Mailman.

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,740
It's over. The end.

23
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,090
Here, take this.

24
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,080
What's that ?

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,360
Notice of Breakup.

26
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,080
If Love receives this, the relationship has officially ended.

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,780
Wait, Love cell is on the ambulance right now.

28
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,440
Love!

29
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,590
Then someone give this to Love–

30
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,600
Then Reason, you accept it instead.

31
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,880
Me? Why me? I'm in charge of reason.

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,950
You have to take it now, there's no time.

33
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,530
No, it's not even my responsibility. Why would you give it to me?

34
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,440
Someone has to accept it.

35
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,170
I don't know.

36
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,050
Where are you going?

37
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,380
You guys! You have to accept the breakup notice

38
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,940
so that the relationship officially ends!

39
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,660
This is not something you can avoid!

40
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,280
If you avoid this now, a bigger problem will happen!

41
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,760
You guys! Where did you go?

42
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:04,810
♫ I think I missed it again, Your heart ♫

43
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,670
♫ I think our time has gotten farther away ♫

44
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,390
♫ Even if I try to look back ♫

45
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,950
Come to think of it,

46
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,580
When I think about it,

47
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,210
Wung must have been angry about something he was disappointed about.

48
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,420
Angry?

49
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,360
You saw it earlier. People can't be that calm when they are breaking up.

50
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,220
Then are you saying he was trying to see what Yumi was going to do?

51
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,960
That could have been possible.

52
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,930
I don't think so.

53
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,130
They both liked each other.

54
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,000
What if Wung is waiting for Yumi to hold onto him?

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,270
Do you think so?

56
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,260
Pathetic, that's enough.

57
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,370
I think this is too pathetic.

58
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,200
- What is...
- Where are you going?

59
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,690
Mailman.

60
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,060
I will take it. I think I'm the only one who can accept the breakup notice.

61
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,070
I'm glad you came around. I can go home now.

62
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,480
But... I'll accept it tomorrow morning with a clear head.

63
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,700
What? Why?

64
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,690
Breaking up is a big deal.

65
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,850
Yumi needs to rest now.

66
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,150
♫ Today too because my day ♫

67
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,050
♫ approaches slowly, ♫

68
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,730
♫ I didn't even expect this ♫

69
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,640
♫ he is playing a joke ♫

70
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,370
♫ Why of all days this morning ♫

71
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,890
♫ without any preparation ♫

72
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,620
I'll just

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,070
pretend it didn't happen.

74
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,040
Yes, I'll do that.

75
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,830
I'll tell him I was a little harsh.

76
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,860
That I didn't mean it.

77
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,400
Wung will understand.

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,180
♫ To me who am spending an unexpected day ♫

79
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,680
I'll go to Wung's place right now.

80
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,660
Yumi, what are you doing now?

81
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,870
Do you not hear me? What are you doing?

82
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,830
Hang up right now!

83
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,120
Do you not have any pride?

84
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
You decided to break up!

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,990
What are you doing right now?!

86
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,070
Get out of here!

87
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,530
I don't care! Forget pride!

88
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,550
I just want to go back to the way things were with Wung!

89
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,850
Wung could be waiting for us to call!

90
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,880
How much more pathetic are you going to make Yumi be?

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,480
Seriously, these guys!

92
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,650
Guys stop it.

93
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,680
Stop it!

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,110
I don't want to break up. I don't need pride!

95
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,340
Wung!
Your call cannot be connected. You will be connected to voicemail.

96
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,890
Please leave a message after the beep.

97
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,550
You can't!

98
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,560
How about it? Does it feel real now?

99
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,450
This is real. Hurry up and accept it.

100
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,300
Let's admit it.

101
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,860
It's over.

102
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,970
Wung

103
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,670
Delete

104
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,590
Delete

105
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,230
Do you want to transfer the contact to the trash?
Yes

106
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,990
Even though I am older, storms are still scary.

107
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,610
But one thing is different.

108
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,540
Now I don't want to be swept away helplessly by the storm.

109
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,890
Everyone hold tight! We must not lose any cell.

110
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,840
Change seats with me. This seat is scary!

111
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,020
You should have told me before we got on.

112
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,360
Guys, let's keep holding on! We have to be different now!

113
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,980
♫ Let's put behind us our weary hearts and think about someone ♫

114
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,040
Yumi is an adult now.

115
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Let's part ways in a cool manner, please!

116
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,560
♫ In the times which I always spent the same way crying ♫

117
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,180
I don't want to send her out looking terrible just because they broke up!

118
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,380
I don't want to walk around with sunken eyes from staying up all night!

119
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,390
Let's not look like a weak person who broke down because of love!

120
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,570
Oh! Assistant Manager Yumi!

121
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,780
Oh.

122
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,850
Good morning.

123
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,570
Good morning, did you have a good weekend?

124
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,160
- You must have worked hard preparing for the meeting.
- Yes.

125
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,760
Did you see the material for today's meeting?

126
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,870
Yes. I like the new planning report.

127
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,030
Oh, really?

128
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,570
Totally. I think the department head will love it.

129
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,400
That's good to hear.

130
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,670
♫ In the familiar meeting and parting ♫

131
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,730
♫ I hide my words ♫

132
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,240
Hold your positions. We will carry out our duties to the end.

133
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
As if nothing happened to Yumi.

134
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,090
♫ will I be hurt? ♫

135
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,970
♫ The past memories will come  ♫

136
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,100
♫  to me again with sadness ♫

137
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,570
It's been a while since I saw a clear sky.

138
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,600
♫ of the stories within me  ♫

139
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,190
Oh! I can also see our village over there!

140
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,670
Guys, Yumi's back to normal.

141
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,300
She's okay now. Let's go home!

142
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,840
♫ In the season which passes  ♫

143
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,500
♫ In the moment which stopped wordlessly ♫

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,710
♫ which stopped wordlessly ♫

145
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,460
♫ If it happens will you say to me? ♫

146
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,550
♫  "you did well" and "good job"? ♫

147
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,180
I returned to my old self after six days.

148
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,740
They were six long days that felt like six months.

149
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,770
It's a call. Who could it be?

150
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,870
It was 9:30 p.m. when we went to wash up.

151
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,370
There aren't many people who would call at this hour.

152
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,980
No way! Wung?

153
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,050
It's not Wung.

154
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,420
Wung could have changed his phone number.

155
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,240
It may be the reason why he didn't pick up on that day.

156
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,200
Come on! Hurry and answer. They'll hang up.

157
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,620
The touch screen won't work because of the soap.

158
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,790
Hello.

159
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,520
Si Yeon?

160
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,130
Did you change your number?

161
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh yes, I'm doing well.

162
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,730
The moment you think it's over, you're tested again.

163
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,660
You said Yumi was back to normal!

164
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,550
Everyone hold on tight!

165
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,860
And another storm comes.

166
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,560
At times like that, we restore Wung's number that we deleted

167
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,460
and look at his profile.

168
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,150
He changed his profile.
Gu Wung.

169
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,070
Wung deleted the couple photo six days after our breakup.

170
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,170
Has he already moved on?

171
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,770
♫ Nightfallin'  ♫

172
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,960
♫ At the end of the sun setting ♫

173
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,780
♫ In me ♫

174

♫ I feel you intensifying Sweet cologne
Truth be told ♫

175
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,500
♫ Sweet cologne ♫

176
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,300
♫ Truth be told ♫

177
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,160
♫ You and I, ♫

178
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,040
♫ we are walking to the same beat ♫

179
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,970
♫ Nightfallin'  ♫

180
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,740
♫  Because you are within my two eyes ♫

181
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,150
♫ I'm hiding the especially red cheeks,  ♫

182
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,670
♫ Yes I know ♫

183
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,350
If I look at Wung's friend Louis' social media...

184
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,420
All-nighter. Feeling empty.

185
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,300
He has a friend named Ji Ni and I look at their friends.

186
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,880
If I go to Gi Yeong's account from the comments,

187
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,240
I can see Wung after our break up.

188
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,550
He cut his hair.

189
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,840
It suits him.

190
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,650
♫ Wandering this time which is filled by you ♫

191
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,050
♫  in this moment ♫

192
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:53,060
♫ even though it's a little constricted so I am out of breath ♫

193
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,400
♫ Will you lock us in this ecstasy? ♫

194
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,870
But, Eonni Yumi, are you really okay?

195
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,370
What are you talking about?

196
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,260
No one would know you went through a breakup if you didn't say anything.

197
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,830
Is that so?

198
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,790
I'm really not the type to show my emotions either.

199
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,170
- You aren't?
- I really don't show them. People tell me they don't know what I'm feeling.

200
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,750
- Is that so?
- But Eonni Yumi, how are you so cool?

201
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,770
I'm hungry.

202
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,440
Huh?

203
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,840
- Pathetic, what is it?
- Shhh.

204
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,590
Writer, can you write something for me, keeping it a secret from the other cells?

205
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,920
Write something?

206
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,900
Can you write something short that expresses Yumi being sad

207
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,560
after her breakup with Wung?

208
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,140
I want to make it obvious somewhere.

209
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,000
Won't that look a bit pathetic?

210
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,030
That's why I'm asking you to make it short.

211
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,950
Short? How short?

212
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,310
How short can you make it?

213
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,730

217
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:12,220
Who is the person who seems to be everywhere but is nowhere?

218
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,440
Answer.

219
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,910
A cool person.

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,800

Episode 02
Cure

224
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,150
Daehan Noodles

225
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,210
It is.

226
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,400
What is this?

227
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,960
As soon as I entered the café, right when I thought it couldn't be that person ... it was that person!

228
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,570
- That's crazy.
- It was a total fail. It couldn't be worse than that.

229
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,320
- More than last time?
- Yes.

230
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,130
- It can be even worse?
- Worse do exist!

231
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,290
Yumi has an illness.

232
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,000
I got it. Eonni, go home safely.

233
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,980
- Okay.
- Get home safely.

234
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,240
- See you next week.
- Bye.

235
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,910
Even though she's perfectly fine at work,

236
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,320
she can't breathe properly at night and is unable to sleep.

237
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,280
I think she has a slight fever too.

238
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,570
This is definitely a symptom of the Monday blues.

239
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,090
Today is Friday.

240
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,060
This illness is the after-effect of a breakup.

241
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,840
The after-effect of breakup?

242
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,580
Breakup Aftereffect
Symptoms can last for a few weeks up to several years.

243
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,120
It can go on for years?! What's the cure?

244
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,970
There aren't any proven cures yet, but there are a variety of home remedies.

245
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,910
You need medicine for the after-effects of a breakup.

246
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,870
What medicine? I heard there's no medicine.

247
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,210
I will let you know the pharmacy I go to.

248
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,710
You can get the cure if you go here.

249
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,130
♫ I also wouldn't know my heart ♫

250
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,830
It's close by, so go there right after you wake up.

251
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,180
♫ There's a me ♫

252
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,190
♫ I don't know ♫

253
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,350
♫ Even if I walk slowly ♫

254
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,910
♫ My heart is running far away there ♫

255
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,110
♫ I don't know ♫

256
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,940
♫ what's the matter with me ♫

257
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,440
♫ Even f I walk carefully  ♫

258
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,410
♫  my heart is far away there ♫

259
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,910
It felt as if I was being played, but I decided to trust him this time.

260
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,910
I was played by Hunger.

261
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,200
There was no change in the symptoms even after eating.

262
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,880
It was tasty, though.

263
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,140
Buy her a pretty purse, that may make things better.

264
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,750
Do you think I'll fall for the same trick twice?

265
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,010
Shopping is a home remedy that's been passed down for generations.

266
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,750
Are you looking down on the effectiveness of shopping?

267
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,280
This illness was caused by Wung's absence.

268
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,020
You need to fill that absence with something for her to get better!

269
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,110
Is that so?

270
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,130
I got played again. Money only got spent, but the symptom remains.

271
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,270
It's because I can't feel anything.

272
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,040
How about a late-night movie? Something very cheerful.

273
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,920
Hey, you scammers!

274
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:12,700
What are you going to do about Yumi? She's not getting any better.

275
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,110
All of you take responsibility! We only spent money!

276
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,590
I hope this isn't a terminal illness.

277
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,370
Yumi might die at this rate.

278
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,400
What are you going to do!

279
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,100
Relax. I'll write you a prescription.

280
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,770
What prescription now?!

281
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,710
Normal treatments won't do. We'll have to try something stronger.

282
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,840
Beer?

283
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,990
Her symptoms seem to be improving.

284
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,690
It really must be working.

285
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,900

Guys, it's been a while!

309
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,440
We're in trouble! Inner Feelings came out because of the alcohol.

310
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,490
Guys, you know...

311
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,750
What?

312
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,570
I miss Wung.

313
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,830
I miss Wung.

314
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,940
Just today. It's just for today.

315
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,830
I'll just look for the last time today

316
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,210
and won't look anymore.

317
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,440
It's a new picture.

318
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,060
- Basketball after quite a while.
- It's really exciting!

319
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,900
They really do look excited.

320
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,520
That can't be! Zoom in!

321
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,540
There must be tears in his eyes.

322
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,500
No, this is one hundred percent excitement.

323
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,920
This can't be.

324
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,980
What is so exciting?

325
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,730
How can you be so excited?

326
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,480
I am stuck at home

327
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,160
being pitiful.

328
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,270
The treatment was unsuccessful.

329
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,140
We're leaving. Bye.

330
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,440
Aren't you going home?

331
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,210
I need to organize some things. You go ahead.

332
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,680
I am not going either.

333
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,700
- What?
- I have to work overtime.

334
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,260
I see.

335
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,310
Call me if you're hungry, I have to eat dinner as well.

336
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,890
Sure.

337
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,680
She's not organizing but just wasting time.

338
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,170
Why? Because there's nothing to do at home anyway.

339
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,490
But Wung must be out having fun.

340
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,850
- It's a fire!
- The village is on fire again!

341
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,380
Please stop thinking about Wung.

342
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,870
We need to divert Yumi's attention to something else.

343
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,520
Reason, I have found the cure.

344
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,480
What?

345
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,780
This is the best home remedy with the highest cure rate for the after-effects of a breakup!

346
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,930
To throw everything that is related to Wung today,

347
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,740
that she wasn't able to throw away before.

348
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,090
Ba Bi, I'm hungry. Let's eat and then continue.

349
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,470
Shall we? Hold on, I'll go and ask if Assistant Manager Yumi also wants to come.

350
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,230
Sure.

351
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,220
Assistant Manager Yumi, will you have dinner—

352
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,400
Yes. If I can't let go of Wung now

353
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,050
until when, will I have no life?

354
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,010
Today I will throw away all the things that I have which are related to Wung.

355
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,640
The first item is the poster of the game that Wung was developing.

356
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,730
How am I supposed to throw this away? It's really big.

357
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,560
You should tear it up and throw it away.

358
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,650
But it's a poster of the game Wung made.

359
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,970
It's something very meaningful to Wung.

360
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah, tear it up.

361
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,340
Yumi!

362
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,550
Can you get up for a sec?

363
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:17,500
The poster is too far to the left in relation to the bed.

364
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,920
What?

365
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,360
No, no, you cannot get lost in your memories.

366
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,860
We were so happy back then.

367
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,850
Stop being so sentimental!

368
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,350
What's wrong with the poster? We broke up!

369
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,540
We don't know if Wung will come back later to get it.

370
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,010
He said they didn't make that many posters.

371
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,840
Okay, all right. We'll leave the poster for now.

372
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:00,020
We'll keep this and throw away the rest.

373
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,350
Next, our couple T-shirt.  [Yummy Cracker]

374
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,350
We bought it to wear when we work out.

375
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,650
The blue one is yours.

376
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,270
Let's see.

377
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,000
- It's nice.
- Isn't it pretty?

378
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,540
- Try it on.
- Now?

379
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,300
All right, that's enough. Let's burn it and throw it away.

380
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,720
Hold on! That shirt fits perfectly and the fabric is so nice

381
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,140
that it's perfect to lounge in.
- We have plenty to lounge in.

382
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,490
It's the best. It doesn't even say it's a couple t-shirt. So why not?

383
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,810
That's right, the fabric is really nice. Why would I throw it out?

384
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,530
I can use it as a rag.

385
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,460
There's no mercy from now on. Throw everything away. Okay, the keyboard.

386
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,710
No! I'm against that.

387
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,860
What now? Why?

388
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,070
My fingers are already used to that keyboard, so it's uncomfortable if it's not that one.

389
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,550
You can get used to another one!

390
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,820
If I change the keyboard and get a slump, are you going to take responsibility?

391
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,660
What kind of nonsense is that? Just throw it away!

392
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,990
Keyboard

393
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,770
What is this keyboard?

394
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,190
It's your first day at the marketing department tomorrow.

395
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,720
It's a present. That's the best mechanical keyboard there is.

396
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,840
Famous writers all use that. I want you to write good things.

397
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,200
I'll keep it until I get used to a new keyboard.

398
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,880
Next is the necklace she got for her birthday.

399
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,880
Let's really throw this away. This will be a cure if we throw it away.

400
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,530
Are you all crazy?

401
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,080
You kept the paper poster, fabric, and everything else,

402
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,830
so why would you throw away a gold necklace?!

403
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,240
You could sell it! If you're going to throw it away, then throw everything away!

404
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,430
Why would you only throw away the gold?!

405
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,400
Start digging and see if you can find gold so easily.

406
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,120
Okay, okay. I'll put the necklace on hold for now.

407
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,440
What's the next item? The next item, what is it?

408
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,140
Ribbit

409
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,460
It's a frog.

410
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,650
Do you remember? The frog that saved us.

411
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,520
Wung's frog.

412
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,210
Hi, Yumi's love cell.

413
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,390
- Who are you?
- I'm Wung's love cell.

414
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,000
What?

415
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,320
it's raining.

416
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,570
How did it go? Did my prescription work?

417
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,540
Its effectiveness was crap. The symptoms got worse.

418
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,960
Can't you see it's raining?

419
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,720
Hello?

420
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,460
Assistant Manager Yumi, when did you leave? I saw you were gone.

421
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,430
Oh, yes. I came home because I had something to do.

422
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:49,470
Then, I'll come by your place in a bit. Can you come out for a second? I'm leaving now.

423
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,450
What? Is there something wrong?

424
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,560
The proposal revision just came out. I think it'd be good if you check it out too.

425
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,840
I only have a hard copy.

426
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,800
I see. Sounds good to me.

427
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,700
- Call me when you arrive.
- I will.

428
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,250
Where is he?

429
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,890
Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi
Hang in there.

430
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,010
I'll be just a moment, sir.

431
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,280
- Did you wait long?
- No.

432
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,770
I'm sorry there was some traffic up here.

433
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,420
Here you go.

434
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,090
It's a secret that I gave it to you. Take a look at it and return it in secret, please.

435
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,840
Sure, thank you.

436
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,010
- I'll get going then.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

437
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,210
- You're okay, right?
- Excuse me?

438
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,030
Hang in there.

439
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,650
We can go, sir.

440
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,800
Time is the only cure for the after-effect of a breakup.

441
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,730
However, one phrase can be a great treatment.

442
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,460
Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi
Hang in there.

443
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,280
Let's go!

444
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,350
Episode 03: Yu Ba Bi Club

445
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,370
- Even though it's daytime, I'm not sweating even a bit today, right?
- Yes.

446
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,880
Fall must already be here.

447
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,620
It's fall already?

448
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,460
Time really flies by.

449
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,930
Come with me next time, it's on me.

450
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,570
Isn't that Ruby?

451
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,550
Why do you always pay?

452
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,870
- Thank you for the meal.
- It's no problem. It's on me again the next time.

453
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,660
- That's Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi from your department, right?
- Yes.

454
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,790
How is she friends with people from other departments?

455
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,240
- It's impressive.
- I'll see you later.

456
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,050
Bye!

457
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,630
Ruby! Lee Ruby!

458
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,830
Hi! I was going to go get coffee.

459
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,830
Eonni, what kind of person is Yu Ba Bi?

460
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,130
What? Yu Ba Bi?

461
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,870
Yes, Assistant Manager Yu Ba Bi. What kind of person is he?

462
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,060
- You know him too, though.
- You're closer to him than me.

463
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,420
You're both older, in the same department, and live in the same neighborhood.

464
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,460
But why are you suddenly asking?

465
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,510
'Cause I'm curious.

466
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,970
- Why are you curious?
- Right.

467
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,290
That's a secret!

468
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,120
Give me some information on Yu Ba Bi.

469
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,680
- Thank you.
- She's always like that.

470
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,190
I think I know why she's curious. That girl...

471
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,980
Guys, what kind of person is Yu Ba Bi?

472
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,200
If anyone knows, can you raise your hand? I need information on Yu Ba Bi.

473
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,080
Is there really not one cell that knows anything about Yu Ba Bi?

474
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,750
- How about going to the club area to check?
- Go to check the club area?

475
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,890
Because Yu Ba Bi is a good person, there may even be a Yu Ba Bi club.

476
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,110
Even if Yumi shows only a little interest about something, a club will be created.
Yumi Club Area

477
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,370
It's really good. It's all really good.

478
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,470
Is it good?

479
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,700
It's really good.

480
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,690
What makes it taste like this?

481
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,890
It's really good, right?

482
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,600
I like stone crab more than blue crab.

483
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,760
Stone crab?

484
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,470
This is stone crab. This place is known for it.

485
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,820
Stone crab? This is stone crab?

486
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,610
What's the difference between the two?

487
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,860
Seaside Village Marinated Crab
It's cheap and delicious.

488
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,540
Sign up for the club!

489
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,800
The best stone crab club.
- Take a look.

490
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,520
A new stone crab club has formed.

491
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,480
Hurry and sign up.

492
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,390
Reason, will you join the stone crab club?

493
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,380
We research everything about stone crabs.

494
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,120
I will explain the difference between a stone crab and a blue crab.

495
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,140
Hey, where are you going?

496
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,590
You can sign there.

497
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,520
Here? Sign here?

498
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,590
Everyone, join the puppy club.

499
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,140
Cute cute puppies!

500
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,280
Did Yumi still have this many interests?

501
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,950
If Yumi loses interest,

502
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,280
the club may close.

503
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,780
Let's call Min Ho from SHINee, Oppa.

504
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,140
Join the Min Ho club.
Choi Min Ho

505
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,680
Charismatic Min Ho!

506
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,260
The Dong Gook Oppa club of 20 years is dying!

507
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,370
Please join!

508
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,210
When Yumi was 20, there were so many clubs.

509
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,810
But there's still a lot left.

510
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,200
He's so sexy. I want Gong Yoo.

511
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,010
What are you doing here?

512
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,030
Naughty, you!

513
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,970
Gong Yoo Club

514
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:40,480
Naughty, you punk. You haven't been around lately and now...

515
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,640
If you aren't going to join, can you get lost?

516
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,550
Are there any cells here that know Yu Ba Bi well?

517
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,700
Yu Ba Bi?

518
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
I need some information about Yu Ba Bi.

519
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,640
You can ask about that over there.

520
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,740
Ba Bi Club.

521
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,480
What's this?

522
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,560
There was really a Yu Ba Bi Club?

523
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,110
Excuse me.

524
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,540
B A B I. Ba Bi.

525
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,140
- Is this the Yu Ba Bi club–
- Nice.

526
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,020
B I–

527
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,000
Hey! Yumi's Guard, why are you here?

528
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,800
Don't misunderstand. I just arrived here to destroy the club.

529
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,810
President, you came in early today again.

530
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,180
You're the president?!

531
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,610
I can't believe it. You were the one who opposed Yu Ba Bi the most.

532
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,100
Are you here to join too?

533
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,480
Do I look crazy?

534
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,900
Give me some information about Yu Ba Bi. Ruby wants to know.

535
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,840
Why Ruby?

536
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,510
Will you just answer my question?

537
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,100
Yu Ba Bi likes to read novels.

538
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,640
I think he reads whenever he has free time.

539
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,590
He buys new books and reads them right away.

540
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,700
What genre does he like?

541
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,040
Genre?

542
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,100
I don't know what genre but he likes books.

543
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,160
What does it say?

544
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,000
I was wondering what you were reading.

545
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,860
Have you read this? It's a bestseller in fiction these days.

546
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,200
No, not yet, but I heard it was interesting.

547
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,690
I have barely read any books lately.

548
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,960
It's really interesting. I also recommend it.

549
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,180
Really? I'll have to write it down.

550
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,080
I finished reading it.

551
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,970
What?

552
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,940
Read it and return it.

553
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,370
Daehan Noodles making the world more delicious.
'A Perfect Day'

554
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,810
Thank you.

555
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,970
Ba Bi Club

556
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,710
President, why are you erasing that?

557
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,110
I don't feel comfortable.

558
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,660
Now that Reason knows, I think he will interfere with our activities.

559
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,730
We need to change it to a private club.

560
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,020
Then we're not even going to promote it?

561
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,970
We don't need to promote because we're a private élite club.

562
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,810
Why? Why do we need to be private?

563
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,840
Ba Bi is interested in Ruby, you idiot.

564
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,050
And Yumi hasn't taken care of Wung's things.

565
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,700
There's no need for misunderstandings. We can just have fun among ourselves.

566
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,270
It's really interesting.

567
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,870
I guess Assistant Manager Yu also likes sweet stories.

568
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,530
That guy.

569
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:17,040
He has a good eye for novels.

570
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,500
Writer?

571
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,280
This is the Yu Ba Bi club, right?

572
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,980
No.

573
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,570
Come on, I heard all the rumors. I want to join this club.

574
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,080
I like his taste in books. I think if he recommended other books, I would like it.

575
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,350
I'm sorry but we are a private club–

576
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,490
I'll be quiet!

577
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,420
I won't make it obvious. It's been so long since I met a guy who likes novels.

578
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,300
This is like meeting a national treasure! Please!

579
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,950
My goodness.

580
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,450
It's interesting.

581
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,540
I enjoyed the book.

582
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,750
Did you finish reading it already?

583
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,780
Yes. It was so interesting I stayed up all night.

584
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,780
- It's interesting, right?
- It really is.

585
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,540
I knew you would like it.

586
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,890
Should I recommend you some similar ones?

587
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,170
Really?

588
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:54,830
It's been a while since I read an interesting book, so I'm motivated to read.

589
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:59,760
I have a lot. Don't buy, borrow them from me instead. I'll lend them to you.

590
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,730
Ba Bi Club Members: 4

591
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,940
Stingy?

592
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,020
As of today, I decided to join the Yu Ba Bi club.

593
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,690
A man who lends books for free is the best.

594
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,570
We don't accept members. It's a private club.

595
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,760
How much do you want? Huh?

596
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,940
Ba Bi Club

597
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,220
What are you listening to?

598
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,620
What?

599
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,910
You look like you're having fun.

600
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh, this?

601
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,900
Can I listen to it too?

602
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,140
Yes, of course.

603
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,170
Sounds good. This must be ska music.

604
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,410
Yes.

605
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:06,560
You must like electrifying music.

606
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,090
Ba Bi Club Members: 5

607
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,690
To be honest, I'm tone-deaf. I don't know much about music.

608
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:16,360
But in ska music, I really like the sound of 'ing.'

609
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,780
I can't explain it well but it's...

610
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,080
This is what you're talking about, the 'ing' sound.

611
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,430
Yes, that's right. "Ing".

612
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,820
- The "ing" sound.
- Yes.

613
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,110
I think it sounds good.
Ba Bi Club Members: 8

614
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:34,500
Oh, right now. ♫ –ing ♫

615
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,700
What the–

616
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,220
I want to join this club. I just got the feeling.

617
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,650
You can't! This is now a private club.

618
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,340
Quiet cells quietly being fans.

619
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,020
You guys.

620
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,600
Let's go in!

621
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,120
I'll recommend a ska band that I like.

622
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,810
This is perfect for turning up the volume and doing chores at home.

623
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,000
My Cotton Candy - Kingston Rudieska

624
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,690
Assistant Manager Ba Bi likes ska music.

625
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,500
Ska? What's ska?

626
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,450
Look it up. It's a thing.

627
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,340
♫ A day that welcomes me with a smile ♫

628
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:47,140
♫ Leisurely driving by a street parade ♫

629
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,780
♫ The footsteps that I walked became a melody ♫

630
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:59,110
Ba Bi Club Members: 21
♫ We're making our own song ♫

631
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,780
Assistant Manager Yumi.

632
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,550
Are you busy?

633
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,410
I need to deliver documents to the team meeting.

634
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,670
Then I'll talk fast. You know Kingston Rudieska, right?

635
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:13,510
- The ska band you recommended last time, right?
- Yes.

636
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,720
Yes, I know them. I liked them a lot. I listen to them every day.

637
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,800
That band is busking in Ilsan.

638
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,530
There was an announcement just now.

639
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,230
Really? Sounds fun.

640
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,060
Do you want to go with me?

641
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,000
It's a chance to listen to them live.

642
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,600
When is it?

643
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,610
It's tonight.

644
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,050
Yumi's Club Zone

645
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,330
I definitely thought I heard something around here.

646
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,340
I heard someone saying Yu Ba Bi to fall for us.

647
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,280
I probably misheard.

648
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,090
Ba Bi is interested in Ruby. Why would he be interested in Yumi?

649
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:02,700
Ba Bi Club

650
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,350
- Today?
- Yes.

651
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,750
Do you have plans tonight?

652
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,560
No, I don't.

653
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,520
Then come with me.

654
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:21,480
Ba Bi Club Number of Members: 52

655
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,370
What's happening?

656
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,220
Our Ba Bi.
Ba Bi

657
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,960
Wh-wh-what are you guys doing?

658
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,260
Why are you all crowded together like that?

659
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,260
Come with me.

660
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,580
I don't know if I can...

661
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,510
You can.

662
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,800
Firmly cover it up. A terrible accident could happen.

663
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,030
These guys are out of their minds anyway.

664
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,020
How could they make a club?

665
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,590
They caused a problem when I let my guard down.

666
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,690
Our Ba Bi.

667
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,790
Marketing Department

668
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,840
What's going on?

669
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,440
Testing. Can you hear me?

670
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,440
It's the president of the "Yu Ba Bi Club."

671
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,010
Calling all the secret members of the Yu Ba Bi Club.

672
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:55,180
Put on your uniforms and come to the village square.

673
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,690
From this moment on,

674
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,180
the Yu Ba Bi club will

675
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,730
be open to the public!

676
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:17,090
Kingston Rudieska Busking

677
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,110
They're too hard on us.

678
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,090
Are you guys crazy? Have you gone crazy?

679
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,050
Why did we come here with him?

680
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,570
Hey! Get it together!

681
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,540
Is Yu Ba Bi a celebrity? Is he an idol?

682
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,680
Yu Ba Bi is not someone to be a fan of!

683
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,810
Move.

684
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,910
So what are you guys going to do?

685
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,760
Are you guys thinking of dating Yu Ba Bi?

686
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,110
Yu Ba Bi is kind to everyone.

687
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,900
And he's interested in Ruby.

688
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,530
You guys don't know? You guys know that.

689
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,610
Are you saying we're going to start having a crush again?

690
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,830
Are we going to be embarrassed like we were with Wu Gi?!

691
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:16,290
Just think of it as coming to listen to music.

692
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,580
In case you feel uncomfortable.

693
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,400
No, I don't.

694
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,880
It's okay, I'm fine. I'm not cold.

695
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,950
It's starting.

696
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,530
Everyone! It's good to see you! We are Kingston Rudieska!

697
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:57,400
Thank you for so many of you coming here! We'll start!

698
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,010
Guys! First, everyone, disperse.

699
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,140
Disperse, then go home and calm–

700
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:29,760
♫ A day that welcomes me with a smile ♫

701
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:36,020
♫ Leisurely driving by a street parade ♫

702
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,470
♫ My footsteps became a melody ♫

703
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,370
Oh yeah!

704
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,020
Yay!

705
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,150
Let's go Yu Ba Bi!

706
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,670
Let's go Yu Ba Bi!

707
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,090
Isn't this great?

708
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:01,500
♫ Traveling towards that wide ocean ♫

♫ You raise me up I'm in love with you ♫

711
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,400
The trombone!

712
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,820
Do you want ice cream?

713
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,790
Sounds good.

714
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,620
Hello, what can I get you?

715
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,470
I'll have the original.

716
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,270
Here you go. Enjoy.

717
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,580
Thank you.

718
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,770
It must be good. I should get that too.

719
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,400
- Can I have the same?
- Sure.

720
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,530
I didn't say anything yet, though.

721
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:05,000
Even if you don't, it's written all over your face.

722
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,990
- It is?
- Yes.

723
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,360
That's not true.

724
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,540
- I have a very good poker face–
- No, you don't.

725
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,950
I don't?

726
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,520
Not at all.

727
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:23,070
Was it the first time when I tried to tell you I found your umbrella in the park?

728
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,950
Excuse me.

729
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,310
- Me?
- Yes.

730
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:36,170
By chance, are you Kim Yumi?

731
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,100
How do you know my name?

732
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,590
You're Assistant Manager Kim Yumi, right?

733
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:46,580
The word "cautious" was written all over your face.

734
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,980
Really?

735
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,190
So I thought you were a very timid person but...

736
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,390
Did you lose your umbrella?

737
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,210
- Excuse me?
- It has a fried egg on it.

738
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,970
That's mine! The fried egg. Yes, that's mine.

739
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,190
But right away I was surprised.

740
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,330
I realized you were a very bright person.

741
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:12,290
I guess I do show it.

742
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,810
- Your face shows what you like and don't like right away.
- Does it?

743
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,830
And it shows when you are flustered.

744
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,920
It does?

745
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:31,210
You have the ring, right?

746
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,870
What?

747
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,830
I guess you figured it out then.

748
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:41,450
And one can tell what you are curious about.

749
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,850
Oh, really?

750
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,860
If I find someone nice, I plan on hanging out with them.

751
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,310
Oh, really?

752
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:49,940
Yes.

753
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,810
Then, by chance, are you interested in a blind–

754
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:56,190
Of course, I won't go on blind dates.

755
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,830
I see.

756
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:04,480
You figured that out right away too.

757
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:11,920
Then, can you tell me what I am feeling right now?

758
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,670
No.

759
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,850
But I want to know.

760
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,860
You're someone whom I always want to get to know.

761
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,790
That's why I want to be with you.

762
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,270
I see.

763
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:38,990
What?

764
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,550
What do you mean by that?

765
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,970
I'm saying that we should date.
