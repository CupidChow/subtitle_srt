Episode 12
Miracle

3
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,940
I ...

4
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,550
will move out this week.

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,710
You're going to move out?

6
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,750
Why?

7
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,930
Could it be

8
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,790
because I talked about getting married?

9
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,150
Let's talk about it next time.

10
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,890
Let's go in. It's cold.

11
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,740
Yumi.

12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,870
The truth is I said that because my circumstances are pitiful these days.

13
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,040
I have pride too, you know.

14
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,150
I really don't mean what I said just now about moving out.

15
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,410
I like being with you too, why would I want to move out?

16
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,450
I really mean it.

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,770
♫ When I'm wandering on the street ♫

18
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm serious.
♫ after a tiring day ♫

19
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,800
♫ When I look up at the sky full of stars ♫

20
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,440
What should we eat? The original and chocolate are good.

21
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,520
I never understood why people stand in lines to buy things.

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,690
Isn't it a waste of time?

23
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,420
Then should we eat something else?

24
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,110
On the other hand, I'm also curious as to how tasty it is, for people to do this.

25
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,630
I can't wait to eat it.

26
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,080
Ah, is that what you meant?

27
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,590
Yes.

28
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,870
I didn't know.

29
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,140
Then I'll have the original and you eat the chocolate.

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Wung, it's tasty, right?

31
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,460
Totally! As expected, Kim Yumi makes an excellent choice.

32
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,940
There's a reason for all the good restaurants across the country. Try the original too.

33
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,690
- Wow!
- It's tasty, right? Right?

34
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,690
Try a bite of this. Try it.

35
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,700
- How's it? It's totally tasty, right?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,750
Wung, it was nice going on a date, since it's been a while.

37
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,520
The churros were also definitely worth the wait.

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,110
You must've been tired today. Get some rest and sleep well.

39
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:10,500
♫ Sometimes I sleep tightly curled ♫

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,350
♫ Hiding a lot of pain ♫

41
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,650
Yeah, I liked it too.

42
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,810
Today's weather was nice, maybe I should have brought my camera. Ah!

43
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,530
I looked up the churros place and it turned out to be very famous.

44
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,310
And fifteen minutes isn't a long wait for that place.

45
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,790
Your legs must hurt too because we walked a lot, Yumi.

46
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,980
Sleep early, I'll come to you in the morning. Sleep well Yumi!

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,030
What's up with you today, Gu Wung?

48
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,690
♫ Like a Star Always be at my side ♫

49
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,070
I think we ...
♫ Like a star shining in the dark night ♫

50
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,110
need to take some time away from each other.

51
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,830
♫ Always shine brightly by my side Like a Star ♫

52
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,620
No, I don't want to.

53
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,230
- Huh?
- I don't want to. No.

54
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,380
Let's not do that, Yumi. Please.

55
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,430
- Wung.
- Yumi, I'll send you proper texts hereafter.

56
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,340
I'll write more than three lines and I'll add emoticons and write a lot.

57
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,910
Please? Let's not do that, please.

58
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,560
No!

59
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,630
No, no.

60
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
Hey! Wake up.

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,170
Are you okay?

62
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,200
What's with the "No! Please."?

63
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,050
- What?
- You had a dream, right?

64
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,390
You must have been really tired too.

65
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,660
I am also exhausted.

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,640
Forget it, let's go home.

67
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,340
Just because we can't finish this by today, will they fire us or what?

68
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,540
Let's go.

69
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,060
Put your jacket on.

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,920
Bye!

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,190
Geez! Why is it so cold?

72

♫ Today again, after a long time  ♫

73
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,580
♫  I was looking forward to your heart ♫

74
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,790
I'll take one steamed bun.

75
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,490
That would be 700 won (≈ 0.53 $).

76
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:42,560
♫ I want to hang onto you​ ♫

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,140
♫ Before we get farther apart ♫

Julie Steamed Buns
Two bags of 20 buns for 11,000 won (≈ $ 8.5).

80
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,150
Let's see.

81
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,880
If each one costs 275 won, then ...

82
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,460
he'll save 425 won every time he eats one.

83
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,860
So in one year...

84
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,800
Goodness gracious!

85
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,260
I think I just found out something amazing.

86
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,650
Let's steam them!

87
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,410
I want to stack up the steamed buns at home!

88
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,610
We can afford to at least indulge with that.

89
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,160
Wow, 800,000 won (≈ $ 620)?

90
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,300
I won't buy it. I won't.

91
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,290
What's that? A steamed bun machine?

92
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,250
Are you going to buy it?

93
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,990
I was just looking at what it looks like.

94
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,950
Why would you buy this? Traditionally ...

95
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,040
steaming buns in an electric rice cooker are the best.

96
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,590
Electric rice cooker?

97
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,770
It steams them totally moist.

98
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,210
- You have an electric rice cooker at home, right?
- I don't.

99
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,270
You don't have a rice cooker?

100
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,140
Electric rice cooker

101
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,200
Electric rice cooker.

102
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,750
Electric rice cookers are also quite expensive.

103
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,920
But we don't even cook,

104
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,940
so is it right to buy a rice cooker for steamed buns?

105
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,470
But then, where do we use our paycheck?

106
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,610
He pays his debt with his paycheck.

107
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,110
Right. He has to pay his debt off.

108
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,240
Right! How much money do we have for emergencies?

109
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,950
Currently the emergency fund has 100,000 won (≈ $ 77).

110
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,370
Is that so? Then shall I look for a second-hand one?

111
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,630
It's cold!

112
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,200
What have you been doing since earlier? You keep looking at your phone.

113
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,970
I'm trying to buy an electric rice cooker.

114
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,090
- I think I can get a second-hand one for a 100,000 won.
- Hey.

115
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,990
Just buy and eat them. Just buy them.

116
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,830
How many are you planning to eat? That you have to buy a secondhand rice cooker.

117
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,950
Even if it's secondhand, I have to buy it.

118
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,390
- Why?
- Because I want to.

119
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,090
Why must you buy it?

120
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,540
- Because I'm unhappy.
- Why—

121
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,660
Geez.

122
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,620
This looks fine.

123
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,740
Unopened electric rice cooker for sale.

124
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,430
Is the rice cooker sold?

125
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,350
No, not yet.

126
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,540
It's new, never been opened.

127
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,080
It's the model I've been looking for, so I'd like to buy it.

128
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,360
Will they give me a discount if I say I'm a student?

129
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,790
You're serious about the rice cooker, aren't you?

130
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,320
Just say you're a high schooler. They will probably give you a better discount.

131
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,300
Hey, wait a minute.

132
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,370
Come quickly!

133
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,250
But I'm a poor student.

134
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
Could I get it for a hundred thousand?

135
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,650
I'm unemployed, so I can't negotiate.

136
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,350
Then I'll come pick it up myself, so let's make it 110 thousand.

137
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,290
No thanks.

138
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,460
We have failed in negotiating.

139
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,640
What? Keep trying.

140
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,490
Student discount also failed.

141
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,170
The seller is unemployed.

142
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,540
What? Unemployed?

143
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,080
A negotiation with an unemployed person is a fight that can't be won.

144
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,810
A hundred and twenty thousand. If you come get it yourself, 5,000 discount.

145
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,910
They're being so cheap.

146
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,180
What the heck. It's pissing me off.

147
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,900
Hey!

148
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,330
Sorry.

149
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,830
You stop this.

150
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,150
I'll give you the rice cooker at my mom's place, she doesn't use it.

151
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,200
- I don't need it.
- No, you need it. Don't you just need to steam buns?

152
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,190
No. Now the problem isn't the steamed buns

153
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,600
but I have to get this rice cooker, no matter what.

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,450
Ah! He's getting started again.

155
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,690
He's creeping me out.

156
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,130
I will take the rice cooker for 115,000 won.

157
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,260
All right.

158
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,960
With the 5,000 discount, I will get more through an on-site negotiation.

159
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,410
- I'll be back.
- Wh-where are you going?

160
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,800
- To get the rice cooker.
- Hey, Wung.

161
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,510
It's embarrassing enough that you don't have anyone to meet on Christmas Eve,

162
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,360
- do you still want to go and get that rice cooker?
- Yes.

163
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,400
No, do you really want to do that on Christmas Eve?

164
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,550
He's gradually getting lamer.

165
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,900
Wait, is he going on a date?

166
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,350
Oh, it's snowing

167
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,810
and furthermore it's Christmas Eve.

168
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,030
What did Wung do last Christmas Eve?

169
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,030
What do you mean? He was with Yumi.

170
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,470
- Oh yeah ...
- But this Christmas...

171
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,030
we don't have Yumi.

172
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,600
- We don't have a home either.
- We don't have money either.

173
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,950
Excuse me.

174
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,640
Fragile Electric Home Appliance

175
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,730
Are you ...

176
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,350
Patdol*?
(his username "red bean")

177
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,720
This is really amazing.

178
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,580
How could this be?

179
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,940
Seriously ... How ...

180
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,280
How did you end up being the one to buy what I posted?

181
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,270
Exactly.

182
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,820
So we meet like this.

183
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,750
Exactly.

184
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,060
Have you been well?

185
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,570
Yeah.

186
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes. I've been fine.

187
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,550
- How about you?
- Me?

188
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,730
Has everything been all right?

189
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,890
You haven't been sick?

190
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,900
I had a few issues.

191
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,760
It's a kind of a long story.

192
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,250
Did something happen?

193
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,990
A bit.

194
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,050
You grew out your hair.

195
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,790
Yes.

196
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,200
I was tired of always having the same length.

197
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,560
What do you think?

198
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,400
It's pretty.

199
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,710
It suits you.

200
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,640
You too. Your short hair looks good.

201
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,610
How could such a coincidence happen?

202
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,660
I'll say.

203
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,370
What a coincidence.

204
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,390
This is like

205
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,730
a miracle.

206
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,280
It's cold. Would you like to have some coffee and chat?

207
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,200
Sure.

208
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,660
Let's go.

209
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,170
Let me.

210
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,900
If this was the old Yumi, this is how it would have been.

211
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,980
Right?

212
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,810
Hey! You really bought a rice cooker?

213
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,410
How much did you get it for?

214
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,130
Did you succeed in negotiating? Did they believe you are a student?

215
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,690
Are you

216
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,600
Patdol?

217
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,840
This is really amazing.

218
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,990
- How could this be?
- Seriously.

219
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,380
The world is small.

220
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,270
Have you been well?

221
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Yes.

222
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,540
Take this.

223
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,320
Yes, I'll take it.

224
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,070
- You grew out your hair.
- Sorry, but I need to rush off.

225
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,490
Oh.

226
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,400
Right. I should give you the money. Wait a sec.

227
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,590
Here. 120,000 won.

228
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,690
- I owe you 5,000 won.
- No, it's fine.

229
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,470
Why? It was 115 thousand.

230
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,090
Yes, but that's fine.

231
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,820
That's not right. We agreed on the price.

232
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,010
Take it.

233
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,070
That's okay.

234
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,910
- Does it have to be like this—
- Then, enjoy the rice cooker. I'll get going.

235
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,340
It's fair Yumi is being like that.

236
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,800
Yes, it's right to be like that.

237
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,290
♫ Today too because my day ♫

238
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,030
♫ approaches slowly ♫

239
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,550

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,170
♫ without any preparation ♫

243
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,140
Wung was also like that.

244
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,810
Wung also acted cold when he turned around.

245
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,070
♫ I thought about it for a long time ♫

246
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,890
It's a bit disappointing,

247
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,300

♫ so that I can feel your love ♫

252
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:20,740
Episode 13
How should I treat you?

253
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,330
Hi!

254
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,060
Look at that.

255
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,140
- Love!
- It's Love.

256
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,890
Christmas Eve at Ba Bi's place!

257
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,930
We've waited and prepared so much for today.

258
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,810
Finally, that day has arrived!

259
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,350
Wahoo!

260
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,180
Today's outfit is perfect too!

261
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,520
Huh? What's that sound?

262
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,540
Emergency alert! Emergency alert!

263
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,650
Wung is here!

264
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,390
Why would Wung show up here?

265
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,910
Emergency alert! Everyone, calm down and gather on the hill.

266
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,290
- What is it?
- What? What is it?

267
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,870
You all must be flustered but we need to decide

268
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,280
quickly on how to treat Wung, whether it be blunt or sweet.

269
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,930
We have only one second.

270
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,500
Everyone get your senses together.

271
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,270
Starting now it's important.

272
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,630
I'm telling you in advance, if you say nonsense during this important moment I won't let it slide.

273
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,650
Of course.

274
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,610
If we're careless, he'll try to negotiate on the spot.

275
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,940
He might ask for another 5,000 discount.

276
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,780
Everyone, stay focused.

277
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,700
As expected, you didn't let me down.

278
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,040
How could we meet on such a day in such a place?

279
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,480
How is this possible?

280
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,300
No wonder I really didn't want to sell the rice cooker.

281
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,890
We don't want to ruin our mood on a day like this.

282
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,120
It's best if we are warm and polite.

283
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,370
Warm? Polite?

284
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,940
- Don't you remember how we broke up?
- Pride!

285
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,250
- This isn't the time to get worked up.
- Guys!

286
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,760
What about solving the problem with this book?

287
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,570
The Ex-Boyfriend Manual.

288
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,390
I found this in the library.

289
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,720
Let's see.

290
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,800
If you unavoidably have to talk to your ex-boyfriend,

291
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
"...leave it to the Reason cell."

292
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,370
Me?

293
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,140
As expected, in the end, I'm the only one to rely on in a very important moment.

294
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,960
Since he's the type to say things bluntly.

295
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
It says you are the right person to do it.

296
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,220
It says there'll be no problems if you just follow Reason's motto.

297
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,360
My motto?

298
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,330
My motto is ...

299
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,060
Keep it short.

300
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,390
Have you been well?

301
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,540
Yeah.

302
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,520
Yeah.

303
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,430
Take this.

304
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,690
You're doing well.

305
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,430
That's how you do it, Yumi!

306
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,030
Rationally and keeping it short.

307
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,590
I owe you 5,000 won.

308
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,130
- No, it's fine.
- Why?

309
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,250
It was 115 thousand.

310
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,470
Yes, but it's fine.

311
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,160
That's not right. We agreed on the price.

312
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
Take it.

313
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,910
It's fine.

314
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,610
He says it's fine! Just put it back in your wallet, Yumi.

315
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,940
Five thousand is worth two bags of bean sprouts!

316
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,550
What's the important thing now?

317
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,760
I came up with great difficulty!

318
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,930
Then, enjoy the rice cooker. I'll get going.

319
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,670
All right, see? You wrapped it up well, rationally, and kept it short.

320
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:46,650
Maybe it's because he cut his hair, but Wung looks gaunt.

321
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,070
Since he looks gaunt he looks better.

322
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,390
But ...

323
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,750
why is a guy who doesn't even cook at home buying a rice cooker?

324
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,480
Why? Why?!

325
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,380
Why today of all days?!

326
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,820
Whatever.

327
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,080
He must have his reasons.

328
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,430
Let's not be concerned about it.

329
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,500
But still why does he look so gaunt?

330
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,030
Like someone whose life isn't working out well.

331
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,910
Is that possible? He said things are going well last time.

332
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,660
No, wait! Do you remember?

333
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,570
The poster we sent back to Wung.

334
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,830
Returned

335
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,130
Why has this been returned?

336
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,400
The poster being returned was weird.

337
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,260
Did he move his office?

338
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,820
Right, then we thought he had just moved his office.

339
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,410
But if there's some other reason...

340
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,490
What's the other reason?

341
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,930
Last day in the studio I love

342
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,100
This is not just a simple move.

343
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,500
Look up the company.

344
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,290
See if there is a new address.

345
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,850
Closed down?
SLW Studio (gaming company) Closed down

346
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,210
It's closed down?

347
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,180
Why?

348
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,910
What do you mean why? Don't you remember that he even sold his house because he had no money?

349
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,710
He must have closed it because he couldn't run it anymore.

350
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,130
No.

351
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,130
He definitely said he got a huge outsourcing contract.

352
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,750
I recently signed a huge outsourcing contract.

353
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,340
- Really?
- An unexpected opportunity suddenly came.

354
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,430
I was surprised too.

355
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,110
I didn't even expect it.

356
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,590
He boasted and was proud.

357
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,970
Right. I heard that too.

358
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,870
But why is it closed down?

359
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,950
Did something happen again recently?

360
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,790
All right. I will start to deduce what happened.

361
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,780
Look at the date. The day she broke up with Wung was the 17th of July.

362
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,750
The post was uploaded on Louis's account on the 24th of July.

363
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,540
Just a week's gap.

364
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,590
He closed the company just one week

365
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,060
after he said he had gotten an outsourcing contract.

366
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,130
Then, did Wung lie?

367
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,190
Why?

368
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,190
We need to hear from a cell that knows Wung well.

369
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,490
Love!

370
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,360
Wung was delightful and joked a lot.

371
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,230
He liked to make jokes and didn't like anything that was serious.

372
00:27:54,230 --> 00:28:00,000
Wung was a person who was bright and had no dark side, right?

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,960
That's not what I mean.

374
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,580
He was someone who never showed his dark side.

375
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,870
Wung wanted to only show what he wanted.

376
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,160
When she talked about marriage...

377
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,200
Gu Wung wasn't able to say anything.

378
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,520
That was because he didn't want to show her his state of poverty.

379
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,730
Stop writing weird stories!

380
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,060
Everybody stop. Stop caring!

381
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,490
You too. Why are you investigating such things after all this time?

382
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,980
Nothing will change even if you find out something.

383
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,460
She already broke up with Wung!

384
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,290
We did our best.

385
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,140
What is there that Yumi didn't do?

386
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,680
The thing that I didn't do...

387
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,060
All your hard times have passed, so only good things will happen now.

388
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,710
Hang in there!

389
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,700
was that I wasn't there when he needed me the most.

390
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,070
♫ I love that smile which is only shown to me ♫

391
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,920
♫ I get so excited with even the smallest details ♫

392
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,510
♫ The shy tremulous voice  ♫

393
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,160
♫ The sunny weather on the street ♫

394
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,160
♫ Everything seemed like a lie ♫

395
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,250
♫ 'Cause it's too perfect ♫

396
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,710
♫ When I fall in love with you ♫

397
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,450
♫ The small stars which bloom ♫

398
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,070
♫ all surround you oh ♫

399
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,540
♫ I have something to tell you ♫

400
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,630
♫ I want to carefully come up to you ♫

401
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,340
♫ and whisper ♫

402
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,280
♫ Everything about you  ♫

403
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,410
♫ Oh everything about you ♫

404
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,350
♫ The moment our eyes met and captured each other ♫

405
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,590
♫ Everything becomes love ♫

406
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,040
♫ Oh everything becomes love ♫

407
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,250
♫ I wandered the universe I found my earth ♫

408
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,070
♫ You were heaven ♫

409
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,550
♫ You were heaven
Anywhere you go ♫

410
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,520
Oh, right, Yumi said she'll make the pizza.

411
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,760
I should make this again quickly.

412
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,860
♫ I can feel you even when I close my eyes ♫

413
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,000
But why isn't she coming?

414
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,560
♫ You were heaven ♫

415
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,280
Huindol Village

416
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,650
Incoming call - Ba Bi

417
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,870
Hi, Ba Bi. I just got off near your house.

418
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,920
Guys, Ba Bi is waiting.

419
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,580
Christmas eve at Ba Bi's house!

420
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,490
We've waited and prepared so much for today.

421
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,550
Yumi's weather is a little bad, but if we all join forces ... Oh?

422
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,770
Let's join forces!

423
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,190
- Why are there just three of you?
- It's just us three.

424
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,540
Where is everyone?

425
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,730
They went home.

426
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,320
Ever since she met Wung earlier, it's been a bit gloomy.

427
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,840
They all went home after it started raining.

428
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,340
How can we have a party in this kind of weather?

429
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,200
- Hey guys ...
- I guess not.

430
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Guys, let's go together.

431
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,990
No that's not it. Don't go.

432
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,680
Where are you going?

433
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,640
Will we be able to have a fun time with Ba Bi with just us?

434
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,470
- That might be impractical—
- No!

435
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,900
- We need to at least cheer each other up!
- That scared me.

436
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,590
We have to cheer up!

437
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,080
Let's give it our all, guys.

438
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,760
Cheer up! For Yumi!

439
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,800
Cheer up! For Yumi!

440
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,380
I'll be there soon.

441
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,540
Shall I come pick you up?

442
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,970
No. Don't come out.

443
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,290
I'll be there right away.

444
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,440
Oh! Yumi, you're still in front of the convenience store, right?

445
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,120
Convenience store?

446
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,010
Then, can you buy some sugar? I ran out of sugar.

447
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,210
All right. White sugar, right?

448
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,400
Merry Christmas

449
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,500
It's our first Christmas with Ba Bi.

450
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,280
Let's make good memories, you guys.

451
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,710
Of course we should.

452
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,760
I even prepared another tree.

453
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,350
It's abundant.

454
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm looking forward to the gift Ba Bi prepared.

455
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,970
What's going on? A blackout?

456
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,610
What's happening all of the sudden?

457
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,690
I'm a bit scared.

458
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,820
Let's gather together, I'm scared.

459
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,600
Don't you guys care?

460
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,340
- Put your hands up!
- Sensitivity.

461
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,370
I'm worrying a lot ... about Wung.

462
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,290
You're the one who said to not care.

463
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,970
But ...

464
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,580
I do care.

465
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,780
- Welcome.
- Hello.

466
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,800
Let's at least tell him "Have a good Christmas."

467
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,880
His situation is worse than before.

468
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,310
Forget it.

469
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,580
We didn't know about that and were resentful all this time.

470
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,390
How would I have known if he didn't tell me?

471
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,230
I think we were too cold when we turned around.

472
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,670
It's Christmas Eve.

473
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,190
Forget it. We deleted Wung's number.

474
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,690
We remember his number.

475
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,130
I can't remember, I forgot it.

476
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,160
You can send a message through the second-hand website.

477
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,110
Are you okay?

478
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,250
You're really pathetic, Gu Wung.

479
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,590
- What?
- That's enough. You look pathetic, you punk.

480
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,840
What are you trying to do now, after all this time?

481
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,940
Wung, I have no idea what you're saying.

482
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,100
You're leaving?

483
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,380
I'll see you tomorrow.

484
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,070
You're not going to take this rice cooker?

485
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,380
Hey! Hey! This morning, Sae Yi ...

486
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,820
Wung. Are you going home?

487
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,850
You're coming over to my place for wine later, right?

488
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,980
Louis said he's coming too.

489
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,620
My boyfriend wants to meet you too.

490
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,130
I have plans.

491
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,000
Plans?

492
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,460
Yeah. Plans.

493
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,630
I'm sorry.

494
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,060
Okay, I got it.

495
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,750
Doors are opening.

496
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,940
Merry Christmas.

497
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,040
Merry Christmas.

498
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,640
Doors are closing.

499
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,450
Wung has plans?

500
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,550
Of course, he doesn't.

501
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,200
Where is he going now?

502
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,410
He should go home.

503
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,340
To that small room. Now?

504
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,650
But today is Christmas Eve.

505
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,140
Then what is he going to do?

506
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Let's talk a walk instead.

507
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,950
How far are we going to walk?

508
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:05,480
Until we don't feel pathetic anymore.

509
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,290
It was so unexpected earlier that I couldn't even say goodbye properly.

510
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,780
Take care. Merry Christmas.

511
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,230
Episode 14: 1224

512
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,970
One week before breaking up with Yumi.

513
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,570
Hello?

514
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,980
Hey, Sae Yi.

515
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,570
By chance, is that offer from before

516
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,580
still available?

517
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,980
Offer?

518
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,480
To work at your company.

519
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,580
Of course it is. I told you.

520
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:24,410
However, only if I can bring Louis with me.

521
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,390
That's my only condition.

522
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,030
How have you been?

523
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,790
I recently signed a huge outsourcing contract.

524
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,150
Really?

525
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,080
An unexpected opportunity suddenly came. I was surprised too.

526
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,180
I didn't even expect it.

527
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,110
That's great. Seriously, congratulations.

528
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,740
Thanks.

529
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,030
Aside from the money, I think it's a good opportunity.

530
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,280
What is he saying right now?

531
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,190
That's all a lie.

532
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,210
I don't want to lie to Yumi.

533
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:07,290
Then you want to tell her the business went completely bankrupt and closed down?!

534
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,010
Pride.

535
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,070
Must we do that, without any self-respect?

536
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,180
Wung's prime cell is Pride.

537
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,160
It's Yumi. Let's answer. Answer it.

538
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,680
Hurry and answer it before the call ends.

539
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,140
Yumi

540
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,570
What? Why did you decline?

541
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,230
What are you doing right now?

542
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,000
They just broke up. You're already being weak?

543
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,170
Wung is the one who said to end things.

544
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,840
What about his pride?

545
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,210
My hair?

546
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,660
I cut it because it's hot. It's summer.

547
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,320
I see. It looks good.

548
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,340
Excuse me for a moment.

549
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,120
You cut it because of the interview.

550
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,580
All the same.

551
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,980
Are you okay?

552
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,870
Am I the only one who failed? You did too.

553
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,860
Although it was mostly my fault.

554
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,890
Who are you to worry about me?

555
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,740
I'm talking about your breakup with Yumi.

556
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,140
- I'm fine.
- That's a lie.

557
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,520
I really don't regret breaking up.

558
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,620
I really don't.

559
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,970
What a cold guy.

560
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,430
Wung's pride cell has a really strong power.

561
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,820
Although Pride is the driving force of Wung's life,

562
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,100
in many cases it has ruined him.

563
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,340
유미 ㅜㅜ*
("u u", which looks like tears falling from eyes and means "sad")

564
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:44,200
It was so unexpected earlier that I couldn't even say goodbye properly. Take care. Merry Christmas.

565
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,070
So ...

566
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,650
Pride, come on, hurry.

567
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,380
Where are we going right now?

568
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,490
You'll know when we get there.

569
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,350
It's a nice place.

570
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,900
This is it. Isn't the view nice?

571
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,410
It's just a mountain.

572
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,900
Look over there. Over there.

573
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,070
Why are you doing this? What are you doing?

574
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,140
Pride, I'm sorry.

575
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,030
Butt out!

576
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,090
Love, what are you doing?

577
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,740
Let me go!

578
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,550
What are you trying to do without me?

579
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,690
Wait!

580
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,640
Love! Don't be arrogant and do whatever you want.

581
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,390
I'm the prime cell!

582
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,230
We don't need a prime cell that's of no help to Wung.

583
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,450
Wung is unhappy now.

584
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,420
Ever since breaking up with Yumi ...

585
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,030
I'm not listening to you anymore.

586
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,370
Love! You're making a mistake!

587
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,670
On Christmas Eve,

588
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,590
Wung finally got rid of his pride.

589
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,990
Yumi ...

590
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,220
It cooked really well.

591
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,040
Wow, it smells really good too.

592
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,540
- Yumi.
- Huh?

593
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,810
Should I help you?

594
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,010
No. This is really fun.

595
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,720
Don't you think I'm really good at this? Right?

596
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,020
Wait and I'll show you the mid-air rotation.

597
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,110
♫ With only dust flying under the light bulb ♫

598
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,010
Should I bring you your phone?

599
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,470
I can't answer it anyway.

600
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,510
Just see who it is.

601
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,670
♫ When it pours rain without respite ♫

602
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,370
- Yumi.
- Huh? Who is it?

603
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,550
Your father is calling.
Dad

604
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,280
Oh ... I can't answer, though.

605
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,300
Can you just answer it?

606
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,080
- Me?
- Yes.

607
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,930
Introduce yourself to him and have a frank chat.

608
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,810
Right now?

609
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,560
♫ Holiday where through the leaves there is a small boat ♫

610
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,430
I'm kidding. I'll have to call him after I'm done with the dough.

611
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,750
Just leave it.

612
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,030
Seriously ...
♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path ♫

613
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:05,120
Don't be scared. My dad isn't a scary person.

614
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,460
Ba Bi, look at this.

615
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,280
Wow. My Yumi is good.

616
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,430
Even higher this time.

617
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,780
I messed up.
♫ Spread your arms and follow the wind's path ♫

618
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,750
It was a slip up.

619
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,050
It's hard. Should I do it instead?

620
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,560
No. Not anyone can do this.

621
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,250
Just watch.

622
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,540
Okay. Then I will prepare the salad.

623
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,230
Okay.

624
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:32,950
You got something again.

625
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,710
It's probably my dad.

626
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,550
He must have sent a text since I didn't answer. Can you check what it says?

627
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,410
It's not from your father.

628
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,030
Then who is it from?

629
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:47,120
Patdol?

630
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,030
It's from someone named Patdol.

631
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,770
Yumi, I have something to tell you. Can you spare me just a moment?

632
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:37,160
Let's meet at that place from earlier. I will wait until you come.

633
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,530
Why is he suddenly doing this?

634
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,650
Didn't Wung misunderstand?

635
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,960
See! It wasn't right to send him a text.

636
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,680
What was wrong with that?

637
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,480
Is it a problem to say "Merry Christmas" on Christmas?

638
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,740
By chance, do you think Ba Bi figured out what's happening?

639
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,660
Ba Bi probably saw the message, it pops up.

640
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,800
Whoa.

641
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,940
This is easier than I thought.

642
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,650
He looks as if he knows nothing.

643
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,870
Do you think he doesn't know because he only saw the beginning of the text?

644
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,920
Yumi, you're hungry, right?

645
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,780
Since we don't have time, let's just put on some toppings.

646
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,640
Huh? Yes.

647
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,160
What are you going to do now? What, huh?

648
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,710
Love, what are we going to do now —?

649
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,830
Love, what are you doing?

650
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,680
She's reading and ignoring it.

651
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,710
Read and ignore.

652
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:42,810
The technique of reading and ignoring a message.

653
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:48,860
Atrocious manners that are only used for those whom you don't want to see again.

654
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,430
You're really going to go with bad manners?

655
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,970
Yes. Not only are we definitely not going, but we are also not replying.

656
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,350
Everyone, forget about it.

657
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:08,650
But Yumi sent a message first.

658
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,300
It was just a message to send my regards.

659
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,320
It would be fine if he just replied to send his regards too, but he's asking her to come out.

660
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,990
Wung is now a memory from the past.

661
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,000
So we're ignoring him.

662
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,590
Yeah, let's not reply.

663
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,710
This isn't right.

664
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,890
I just said "Merry Christmas."

665
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,320
It's -8 degrees C.

666
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,340
It's -8 degrees C outside.

667
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,570
What if he keeps waiting?

668
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,690
What if he gets sick?

669
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:52,910
Let's at least reply to tell him we're not going.

670
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,390
If he gets sick, it'll be Yumi's fault.

671
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,160
Love.

672
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,630
If she tells him she isn't going, he might keep telling us to come.

673
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,410
Then let's do this.

674
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:11,370
It's mean to read and ignore it, so let's send a message

675
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,690
that will take care of it in one go so he won't reply again.

676
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,130
"I'm with my boyfriend right now. I'd like it if you don't contact me like this."

677
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,590
All right, what do you think?

678
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:23,690
That's cruel.

679
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,420
It's too cruel.

680
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,480
Think about it.

681
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,430
Do you really have to be that cruel on Christmas Eve?

682
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,570
Don't you think just now that Patdol was Gu Wung?

683
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,330
Yumi, I have something to tell you. Can you spare me just a moment?

684
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,080
Who else would have something to tell her on a day like today other than her ex-boyfriend?

685
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,680
You're right. It's probably Gu Wung.

686
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,010
Just from seeing Yumi's response, it's Gu Wung.

687
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,760
You saw, right? She was surprised.

688
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,490
What do we do now?

689
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,870
Should we have told Yumi?

690
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,030
Are you talking about what happened back then?

691
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,700
Yeah, what happened back then.

692
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,030
- Coffee after eating is best.
- You have a coupon.

693
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,850
When we ran into Gu Wung by chance.

694
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,650
Oh, right! I have a coupon.

695
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,490
That's right, I had a coupon.

696
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,810
- Hello.
- Oh!

697
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,550
You remember me, right? It's been a while.

698
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,930
Of course.

699
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,580
- Go ahead, I'll be there.
- All right.

700
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,120
Hello.

701
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:08,230
- But what are you doing here—
- But what are you doing here—

702
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,530
I'm here for a business meeting on the tenth floor.

703
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,250
And you?
Gu Wung - Programmer

704
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,750
I work here.

705
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,660
- What?
- I joined a gaming company, up there.

706
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,320
Then what about the studio you used to run?

707
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,900
It closed.

708
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,720
What?
Pooenixsoft
Programmer - Gu Wung

709
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,530
Why?

710
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,430
It went bankrupt.

711
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,930
I see ...

712
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,740
I see. I didn't know.

713
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,950
It happened. It wasn't pleasant.

714
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,550
I see.

715
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,060
I'm running late.

716
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,450
It was good to see you.

717
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,490
But ...

718
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,930
Is Yumi ...

719
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,600
doing well?

720
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,560
Yes.

721
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,760
So she's doing well.

722
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,350
She is.

723
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,480
Then, goodbye.

724
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,860
He couldn't bear to tell him ...

725
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,530
that he was dating Yumi.

726
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,930
Assistant Manager Yumi.

727
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,270
Are you back already from your meeting?

728
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,530
Yes.

729
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,830
These are the modifications from NeoFlex, please review them.

730
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,710
All right, thank you.

731
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,710
What about lunch?

732
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:08,950
I ate.

733
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,870
- Then do you want to get a coffee?
- Sounds good.

738
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:43,510
He also couldn't tell Yumi about Gu Wung's situation.

To be honest, it won't be of any help to Yumi.

741
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,650
You're right. What good would it do if Yumi knew about it?

742
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,420
Right?

743
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,490
But did we really not say anything for Yumi's sake?

Yumi, should I put a lot of mushrooms?

746
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,200
You like mushrooms.

747
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,490
I'm going to put it in the oven right now, so put what you want ...

00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,390
Ba Bi.

749
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:26,220
Are you going somewhere?

750
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,840
I think I need to go out for a bit.

751
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,850
It looks like she's going to meet Gu Wung.

752
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,290
It's no mistake. She's going to meet Gu Wung!

753
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,400
Gu Wung, that jerk! Isn't this going too far?

754
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,000
Asking to meet on Christmas Eve is bad manners!

755
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,240
Gu Wung doesn't know that she's dating us.

756
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:54,280
Still, Yumi's going to go just because he asked?!

757
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,530
How could Yumi do this?

758
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,640
No! Let's not let her go!

759
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,590
Let's let her go.

760
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,770
What?

761
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,790
You know they used to have a good relationship. What if they meet again and ...

762
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,320
I know. Let her go.

763
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,910
That is the only thing we can do right now.

764
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,860
Ba Bi, I wasn't able to tell you earlier ...

765
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,780
The truth is, the person named Patdol is ...

766
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,600
Okay.

767
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,780
Hurry and come back.

768
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,030
I'm going to bake the pizza right now, so don't be too late.

769
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:43,660
Ba Bi, you don't even know whom I am going to meet.

770

Wung.

00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,420
Yumi's here.

783
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,710

We got rid of Pride,

787
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:59,350
so Wung, let's tell her sincerely what you have always said in your dreams.

788
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,630
This is your last chance right now.

789
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:15,050
Were you waiting long?

790
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,250
No.

791
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:21,090
Thanks for coming.

792
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:25,240
I thought you might not come.

793
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,490
There wasn't any meaning behind the message I sent.

794
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,640
It's just because it's Christmas—

795
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,900
I regretted it.

796
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,240
Back then, I thought what I did was right,

797
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,680
but it wasn't.

798
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,250
I regretted not being honest with you.

799
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,290
I couldn't get rid of my pride.

800
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,050
At that moment when we broke up, I should at least have been honest—

801
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:51,740
I'm dating someone.

802
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,120
- What is that?
- What is that?

803
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,560

816
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,150
Yumi's stone fastball scorched the village.

817
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:47,070
What did Yumi just say?

818
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,670
I couldn't hear properly.

819
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:53,050
Yumi has a boyfriend.
Warning

820
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,670
Does Yumi have a boyfriend?

821

Yes.

Is it true?

824
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,850

Then why did Yumi come?

829
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,220
If she didn't have even a bit of regret, she wouldn't have come.

830
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,970
No! That isn't true!

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,210
but it was sent back.

840

It must have been tough for you.

I think his family is well-bred.

They must run a business. Find out.

926

To be honest, I don't really like my dad.
