00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,910
Yumi's Cells 2

2
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,110
Episode 27: A Changed World

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,070
The world is bound to change someday.

4
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,970
The same goes for our cell village.

5
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,370
The day that she broke up with Ba Bi,

6
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,140
Love changed into the incarnation of rage.

7
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
Look at this!

8
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,630
When Yumi is angry with herself, she causes her cells' characteristics

9
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,050
to transform into the complete opposite?

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,140
Love wasn't the only one that changed.

11
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,810
Fashion! You're changing!

12
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,810
What?

13
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,750
What's happening?

14
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,100
Why is this happening to me?!

15
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,730
What about me? What is this?!

16
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,230
Look at her! Leaves are growing on her head!

17
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,400
Fashion cell was cursed and changed into a fashion terrorist.
[Stylish]

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,320
Stingy became a tree that gives generously.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,770
Currently: Tree that gives generously.
Formerly: Stingy.

20
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,000
What's with this?

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,940
Why did I become a tree?!

22
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,000
And...

23
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,420
What's going on?

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Writer rose to the position of prime cell.

25
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,360
It's a new prime cell!

26
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,960
Did I really become the prime cell?!

27
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,450
It's nice to be the prime cell!

28
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,500
It's my world now!

29
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,960
Writer now reigns over this world.

30
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,990
Ruby

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,030
Hello? Hey, Ruby.

32
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,380
Eonni, what are you doing? Are you busy this weekend?

33
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,490
- Why?
- Eonni, go on a blind date.

34
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,590
A blind date?

35
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,860
My friend's older brother is an accountant. When I showed him your picture in your book,

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,200
he really liked you and asked me to introduce you to him.

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,190
I know him. He's 185 cm tall, has a great personality, and is really handsome.

38
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,950
On top of that, he's one year younger than you.

39
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,790
He's got qualifications that would totally slap Yu Ba Bi in the face.

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,310
But I'm busy. My deadline is this weekend.

41
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,280
Then you can meet him during the week.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm busier during the week.

43
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,110
Then you can meet him next week.

44
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,600
No. I don't have any intention to do that, Ruby.

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,410
Why do you always say that?

46
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,420
At a time like this, you should show off and go on a blind date

47
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,610
with a man that's better than Yu Ba Bi.

48
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,470
You can do it, Eonni.

49
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,620
Eonni, your book is selling well these days and your ranking is getting higher and higher.

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,120
You have to strike while the iron is hot.

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,700
Ruby, you know what? I reallly really have no intention of doing that these days.

52
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,430
I love writing, seriously. I want to keep focusing on it like I am now.

53
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,070
I don't want to be distracted by anything else.

54
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,730
Eonni, you'll become an old spinster if you keep this up.

55
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,270
- I think I'd be all right with that, too.
- Oh my god!

56
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,820
Ruby, I have to go to a meeting, so let's talk later.

57
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,630
Anyway, I'm really not doing it.

58
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,860
And thank you.

59
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,170
♫ I also wouldn't know my heart ♫

60
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,010
Oh, that's right. I don't think I washed my face.

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,120
♫ There's a me  ♫

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,580
What should I wear today?

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,260
♫ I don't know ♫

64
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,450
♫ Even if I walk slowly ♫

65
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,330
Should I just wear what I wore yesterday?

66
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,930
♫ My heart is running far away there ♫

67
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,500
One second, Writer!

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,630
Can you take a look at the writer look I designed?
Currently: Fashion Terrorist. Formerly: Fashion.

69
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,710
- Writer look?
- Yes.

70
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,110
To succeed as a writer, managing her image

71
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,880
is just as important as writing is!
Yumi's Writer Look ☆

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,190
Even if she's busy if you give me a little time,

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,030
I'll go to the mall tomorrow and complete a sophisticated writer look —

74
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,940
Guys, throw her in jail immediately!

75
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,520
Why are you doing this? Let me go!

76
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,250
You have some nerve going on and on about clothes. What would a writer need clothes for?

77
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,020
A writer only shines through their writing. Writing is a writer's clothes!

78
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,580
Wait!

79
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,220
It's a misunderstanding. I'm not asking to buy clothes.

80
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm saying we use Yumi's existing clothes to style an outfit.

81
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,570
Like a writer!

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,390
What do you think? It gives off the feeling of a true writer, doesn't it?

83
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,360
This looks pretty good.

84
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,660
She got rid of all her pictures.

85
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,260
When did she do that?

86
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,000
So she broke up with her boyfriend.

87
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,540
It's no wonder that these days...

88
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,110
she's been looking shabby.

89
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,130
Hello!

90
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, you're here.

91
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,570
Have you been waiting long?

92
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,510
It's really cold today too. When will it warm up?

93
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,770
Miss Writer, I know that you're going through a hard time.

94
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,430
But please cheer up. Fighting!

95
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,340
I think that when you're going through things like this, you should eat better

96
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,170
and dress prettier.

97
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,720
What are you saying?

98
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,960
I made a big effort to put this look together.

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,220
What do you mean?

100
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,840
This is a writer look!

101
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
This is an exam period look.

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,370
Exam Period Look:

103
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,780
An outfit that you don't use even one gram of energy on fashion to come up with.
(Baseball caps are a national rule in those times)

104
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,330
Really? Is that what I look like?
A writer's casual horn-rimmed glasses. A worn-out sweater.

105
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,150
- What?
- I'm more surprised that you're surprised about this.

106
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,590
Don't I look like a really competent writer?

107
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,450
Don't you look more like a writer who has given up on life?

108
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,790
Really? Oh, well.

109
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,790
Yumi has changed.

110
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,600
One hot cappuccino and one green tea latte. Is that right?

111
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Yes. Here.

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,720
That's all right, I'll pay.

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,490
Again?

114
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,880
Yumi's paying again?

115
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,500
Just buy it for him.

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,700
What else will she do with all that money?

117
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,910
Hey, did you forget about the time when you were Stingy?

118
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,610
It's all useless.

119
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,970
She's not even dating, so what's she going to spend the money she earns on?

120
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,500
She's always locked inside, writing. Does that cost anything?

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,490
Does she ever get on a plane and fly somewhere?

122
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,790
She's paying! Let's spend money generously.

123
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,070
Don't we earn money to spend it all?

124
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,340
You've been paying all week.

125
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,630
I'll keep paying.

126
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,530
Then please add a slice of tiramisu.

127
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,810
Oh, and a slice of pecan pie.

128
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,580
Sure. I'll add a slice of tiramisu and pecan pie.

129
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,050
But it feels like you're spending too much money these days.

130
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,730
I got the down payment for my next project. Don't worry.

131
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,250
Yumi has changed.

132
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,240
This is so good!

133
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Writer, I have a question.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,100
About the ending of chapter seven? That's explained in chapter eight.

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,000
No, not that. Why did you break up?

136
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,760
Please sign off on this, Writer.

137
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,820
What is it?

138
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,480
We need the prime cell's approval to handle sensitive matters.

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,750
You're asking me if we can tell Control Z why she broke up with Ba Bi?

140
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,490
What's the big deal about that?

141
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,570
- All a writer needs to do is write well!
- Hey!

142
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,340
You're asking why we broke up?

143
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,840
- You don't have to tell me if you're uncomfortable.
- He said he was swayed when an intern confessed to him.

144
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,900
That's why we broke up.

145
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,920
- Really? Why would—
- Hey, woah woah woah!

146
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,780
Don't swear at him saying it's for my sake, because he isn't someone who should get sworn at.

147
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,420
I like this more. This is my pick.

148
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Yumi has changed a lot.

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,160
Eat while working.

150
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,870
I finished reading it.

151
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,360
What do you think of the manuscript?

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,990
Is it unrealistic again?

153
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,180
Something that doesn't exist in this world?

154
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,080
It seems it's not good again.

155
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,120
Writer.

156
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,860
Move your head this way for a second.

157
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,750
Now down here.

158
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,980
Your manuscript is good.

159
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,500
There's more that changed in Yumi.

160
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,390
After the breakup, Yumi's writing skills improved a lot.

161
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,180
Bow-Wow Time

162
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,000
Yumi wasn't the only one to change.

163
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Bye.

164
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,650
- Did you eat lunch?
- Yes.

165
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,070
- Director! I was just about to call you.

166
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,790
- Why?
- The Hi-Jenny meeting got pushed back thirty minutes at their request.

167
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,870
- Thirty minutes?
- Yes.

168
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,870
- Got it.
- Have a good day.

Ku Woong Games CEO Gu Wung

172
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,510
Hey! Hey! Wung!

173
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,310
Big news!

174
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,630
- What do you think?
- About what?

175
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,310
I have an interview now. Which one?

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,460
You always look bad.

177
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,760
Is that how you speak to your CEO, you punk?

178
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,310
Respected CEO Gu, look at this.

179
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,000
What's this?

180
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,320
"My Love Muse"?

181
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,430
This is a romance novel that's popular among young women these days.

182
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,890
So? What about it?

183
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,170
Look at the writer's name.

184
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,900
Writer Kim Yumi.

185
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,970
This Kim Yumi is that Kim Yumi.

186
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,590
Sae Yi was shocked and sent it to me.

187
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,280
It must be someone with the same name.

188
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,310
Is there just one Kim Yumi?

189
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,430
It's really that Kim Yumi, man.

190
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,810
I saw the profile and it's your ex, your ex-girlfriend Kim Yumi.

191
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,260
I was happy to see it was her. Yumi really became a writer.

192
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,710
You told me she writes well. She actually became a writer.

193
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,550
Isn't that amazing?

194
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,850
That's good.

195
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,510
Try contacting her.

196
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,630
- What?
- Won't she be thankful if you send a congratulating message after all this time?

197
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,780
Are you crazy? Why would I?

198
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,990
"Why would I?"

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
- Huh?
- CEO. The reporter is here.

200
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,830
Hey, get out. I have to do this interview.

201
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,300
Are you really not going to contact her?

202
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,610
CEO Gu Wung

203
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,640
Why did you think I'd contact her?

204
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,460
I thought it would be nice

205
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,410
to tell her how well we're doing when you congratulate her.

206
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,940
I didn't earn money to brag about it to my ex-girlfriend.

207
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,370
I know you didn't.

208
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,890
But we were at our worst when you broke up with Yumi.

209
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,390
Maybe it's because of this that I want to let her know. At least I do.

210
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,170
Let her know that we have succeeded this much.

211
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,530
There's no reason to contact her.

212
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,330
Really?

213
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,780
- Yes.
- You're an idiot.

215
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,270
Congratulations again for being selected as one of last year's top ten most promising developers.

216
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,080
I'll end the interview with just one more question.

217
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,850
Where does your passion come from?

218
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,360
Passion?

219
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,900
Yes. I'm wondering what drove you

220
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,660
to come this far in just two years without giving up, even when you went bankrupt.

221
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,760
What drove me?

222
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,030
Money?

223
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,290
To say that in different words, what gives you the strength to keep going?

224
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,260
What gives me the strength to keep going ...

225
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,890
Money?

226
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,870
It's not money.

Even when he made a lot of money he wasn't working as hard as he did back then.

228
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,730
Then what should our answer be?

229
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,050
Hey, Artificial Intelligence! Tell us what the best answer is!

230
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,330
The energy that moves Wung

231
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,930
is deeper inside his heart.

232
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,620
Deeper inside his heart?

233
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,840
There was a place like that?

234
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,240
Where is that place?

235
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,050
It's here.

236
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,490
What's in here?

237
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,940
- Money?
- Hang on.

238
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,320
The password is

239
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,650
four,

240
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,900
eight,

241
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,410
six.

242
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,310
It's open!

243
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,310
There's nothing in here.

244
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,390
What's this?

245
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,230
It's Yumi.

246
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,020
Prettier Yumi

247
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,430
Look here, one more time.

248
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,670
Wung, look over there. The sunset is so pretty.

249
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,090
Yumi.

250
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,200
Prettier Yumi

251
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,290
It's the moment when he was the happiest.

252
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,440
But he gets energy from this one picture?

253
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,510
That doesn't make sense.

254
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,280
There's one more here.

255
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,390
It's the moment when his heart broke.

256
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,450
I see.

257
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,490
So when we combine these two memories

258
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,390
a very powerful energy bomb—

259
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,220
Who was it? Who meddled with our Wung's wound again?!

260
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,580
If it's a difficult question, you don't have to answer, CEO.

261
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,360
What keeps me going is ...

262
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,880
love.

263
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,510
L-love?

264
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,990
Yes.

265
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,660
- What kind of...?
- My love for games.

266
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,570
You're talking about your motivation for games.

267
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,610
I understand. Thank you for today.

268
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,790
Let's not open this again.

269
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,440
Every time we open it, the village will be scorched.

270
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,600
But we heard Yumi became a writer.

271
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,410
It doesn't have anything to do with Wung.

272
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,060
We won't be seeing her again.

273
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,850
- Really?
- Did you forget?

274
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,600
That day, two years ago?

275
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,250
2 Years ago

280
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,430
He knew it was pointless, but he was very curious ...

281
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,120
about Yumi's new boyfriend.

282
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,120
Oh! It's here.

283
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,460
Is it this man?

284
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,910
I know this guy! Where have we seen him?

285
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,330
Yes! It's that guy!

286
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,060
Wung!

287
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,730
- Hello.
- The guy who came in Wu Gi's car.

288
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,110
Put it on. It's still chilly at night.

289
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,430
The guy who gave Yumi his jacket.

290
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,000
The guy who made Wung feel pitiful at the bus stop.

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,450
You must be visiting Assistant Manager Yumi's house.

292
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,860
The guy who was continuously around Yumi.

293
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,810
I also remember his name, it was something like

294
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,210
Ba- Ba- Ba Mi, Ba Bi, Ba Bi. Yeah.

295
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,540
You're right.

296
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,990
- Yu Ba Bi.
- Hello.

297
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,950
- Oh?
- You remember me, right?

298
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,810
It's been a while.

299
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,900
We decided at that time that we'll succeed no matter what.

300
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,250
And that there won't be a reason

301
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,670
to contact Yumi ever again in Gu Wung's life.

Writer Kim Yumi's Debut Novel: "My Love Muse"

305
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,640
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

306
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,160
Where are the romance novels? The ones that women read a lot.

307
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,950
They're over there in section A-6.

308

Written by Kim Yumi

311
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,880
You're pretty impressive, Kim Yumi.

312
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,230
"My Love Muse", Writer Kim Yumi's Debut Novel

313
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,700
There was something else that had changed about Yumi. After the book was published,

314
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,780
she got into the habit of going to the bookstore to secretly see people's reactions.

315
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,590
To see how happy someone was when they picked up the book.

316
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,860
Where did it go?

317
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,390
Are you looking for something?

318
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,480
Oh ... um ... I'm looking for a book.

319
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,140
- I thought it was here.
- What is the book's title?

320
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,980
- It's "My Love Muse."
- Just a minute, I will check for you.

321
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,420
What's going on? Did they remove it because it's not selling?

322
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,910
That's going overboard.

323
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,040
Miss, I'm sorry, but "My Love Muse" is sold out.

324
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,170
- Its sold out?
- Yes, we are getting more copies in tomorrow.

325
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,780
I'm sorry.

326
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,590
It's sold out?

327
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,510
Really?

328
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,790
All those books?

329
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,160
The world is bound to change.

330
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,130
Yumi became an writer

331
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:40,080
and Wung succeeded enough to be able to buy all of Yumi's books.

332
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,350
Fate

333
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,210
Episode 28: Do you believe in fate?

334
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,270
I'm in first place!

335
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,380
Oh yeah! First place!

336
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,280
It's readable. It's not bad.

337
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,110
It's getting better as it progresses. The male lead is so attractive!

338
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,240
I paid, so why does it say I can't read the next episode?

339
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,890
Julie Publishing, are you working?

340
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,340
My Love Muse Episode 10

341
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,550
Extremely boring.

342
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,650
Boring?

343
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,120
Extremely boring.

344
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,580
They said it is extremely boring?

345
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,540
Boring! Extremely boring!

346
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,420
Boring! Extremely boring!

347
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,550
This punk. He even got into Yumi's head.

348
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:04,280
You! Because of you, even the weather has become bad! Get lost!

349
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,990
What's happening?

350
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,360
What's happening? Why is he getting bigger?

351
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Malicious comments have stronger vitality than regular comments.

352
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,740
The more interest you give them, the stronger they get.

353
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,390
- Boring!
- Everyone! Stop paying attention to him!

354
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,180
Writer can't hear this! Let's not listen!

355
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,920
Extremely boring!

356
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,260
What's so boring about it? Is it that bad you have to say it's extremely boring?

357
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,450
You paid to read it.

358
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,920
Whatever. There will be people who don't find it enjoyable. Let's not pay them any attention.

359
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:02,900
Boring. Extremely boring.

360
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,120
Look at that, now that we're not giving it any attention its voice is getting quieter!

361
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,020
- You're right!
- If they don't receive attention they have no incentive to do it.

362
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,710
Let's get our wits about us, since Yumi is a web novel writer now!

363
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,660
Got it!

364
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,500
- It's done!
- It worked.

365
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,650
It must be dead.

366
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,290
- Today, we aren't even going to talk about comments, got it?
- Got it.

367
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,070
Writer, have you arrived? I'm running 10 minutes late.Sorry.

368
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,140
I just arrived, take your time.

369
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,660
By the way, did you see the comments today?

370
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,850
Boring! Absolutely boring!

371
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,540
Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!

372
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,430
- Boring! Boring!
- Damn it! He's revived because of Control Z!

373
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,680
Ugh, I'd almost forgotten about it.

374
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,520
The comments seem positive today.

375
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,600
There were lots saying it was boring as well though.

376
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,120
No, there were far more compliments. Are you sure you weren't just reading the negative comments?

377
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,100
I will screenshot the positive comments and send them to you.

378
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,120
Thank you.

379
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,610
Strangely enough, Control Z seems a better person the more you get to know him...

380
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,200
- The pictures are pretty!
- The pictures are dope. Chills.

381
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,010
I got into it because the pictures were nice, but the story is ...

382
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,060
I can't believe it.

383
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,520
What the heck. He just screenshotted people complimenting him. How annoying.

384
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,120
Writer Yumi, I'm sorry.

385
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,170
- You're having milk tea as well, right?
- Yes.

386
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,670
Thank you. I just love this taste.

387
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,700
- You must be busy.
- I'm really getting so much work lately.

388
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,600
I guess the word is out that my drawings are awesome.

389
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,180
- So can I leave a little early today?
- Why?

390
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,560
I have another meeting right after this and it's really important.

391
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,940
If that works out, I might not be able to do illustrations for web novels anymore.

392
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,280
That's not fair! What about 'My Love Muse'?

393
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,740
I have to do that. You saw the comments saying the drawings are 'freaking awesome'.

394
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,120
I will work with you until the end, so don't worry.

395
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,820
Thanks.

396
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,360
No need. By chance…

397
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,420
do you know this guy?

398
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,010
He's really doing well these days and I'm meeting him today.

399
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,880
You know 'Bow-Wow Time', right? It was a super popular game last year.

400
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,290
We are making this game right now, called 'Bow-Wow Time'.

401
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,500
The dog is trying to find snacks hidden by its owner.

402
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,170
It's cute.

403
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,190
He got super famous with this one game and

404
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,820
I was asked to illustrate for season 2.

405
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,780
This is so popular among the ladies.

406
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,680
So they need my sensitive touch to the drawing or something.

407
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
That's a good picture.

408
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,970
Apparently he needs a lot of characters for season 2.

409
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,230
So if this works out, I might get super rich.

410
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,050
- He really became successful.
- The degree of his success is—

411
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,560
Do you know him? Do you know this guy?

412
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,490
Well, a little?

413
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,260
What? How do you know him? Are you close?

414
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,600
Then can I mention your name to him? This is really important to me.

415
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,080
I don't think mentioning my name would really help.

416
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,860
Huh?

417
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,280
It's probably better for your future to pretend to not know me.

418
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,570
- What the heck? That's weird.
- What is?

419
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,400
CEO Gu Wung wasn't your past

420
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,360
boyfriend or something like that, right?

421
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,340
"Can we tell Control Z that Wung was Yumi's ex-ex-boyfriend?"

422
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,190
Yes.

423
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,220
Stop bringing me things like this! What's this got to do with Yumi's writing?!

424
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,850
Oh, no!

425
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,490
That's right. He was my ex-ex-boyfriend.

426
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,970
What? The creator of 'Bow-Wow Time' is your ex-ex-boyfriend?

427
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,880
No way. I don't believe you.

428
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,460
Wait. Your ex-boyfriend was super handsome, too.

429
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,810
Still… Such a successful guy was your ex-ex-boyfriend?

430
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,300
That can't be true. Do you have any idea how much money his company makes now?

431
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,390
Hold on. It turns out that you are a very attractive woman,

432
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,910
but I was the only one not seeing it?

433
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,260
What kind of charm do you have that I'm the only that doesn't know about it?

434
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,630
Please keep those thoughts in your mind.

435
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,570
And don't say them aloud, please!

436
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,610
I really don't get it.

437
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,830
He wasn't doing well when he was with me. He's doing well now.

438
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:29,190
But that's great for him. He worked really hard.

439
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,230
Then ... why did you two breakup?

440
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,160
I knew you'd ask that question again.

441
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,940
She broke up with Wung because …

442
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,830
It's because he sent a text with no sincerity ...

443
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,150
That's not it. Did they fight at the wedding before that?

444
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,230
No. Was it because of churros?

445
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,820
To explain why she broke up with Wung,

446
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,400
you can read 100 volumes of 'History of Yumi's Modern Love Life.'

447
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,600
History gets more interesting as you learn more.

448
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,060
According to official records, Yumi didn't dump him, but she got dumped.

449
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,460
You have to go back a few months before the breakup with Wung to find out the reason for that.

450
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,460
When Wung was living with Yumi. So ...

451
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,130
Huh? Where did she go?

452
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,190
I don't know. It's been too long, I don't even remember.

453
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,360
Sure.

454
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,710
I really don't remember.

455
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,160
It was a pretty serious issue back then.

456
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,280
Looking back now, I don't even remember.

457
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,250
Anyway, I don't think mentioning me would help at all, so don't.

458
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,380
Okay. Then I have no choice.

459
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,420
I'm going to have to use my own ways to build friendship.

460
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,600
- Your own ways?
- Yup.

461
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,830
All right, I hope we collaborate well to yield a good outcome.

462
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,140
You'll probably need to discuss more between your teams, so I'll excuse myself.

463
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,630
Yes, sir.

464
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,060
Have a good meeting.

465
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,150
Mr. Gu Wung.

466
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,680
There are two things I do every day.

467
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,910
Do you know what they are?

468
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,350
- Am I supposed to know?
- One thing is to breathe.

469
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,310
And the other one is to play Bow-Wow Time.

470
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,170
Bow-Wow Time is my favorite game.

471
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,800
If I ever got to meet the creator of my favorite game,

472
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,210
I really wanted to express my respect and appreciation.

473
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,540
Wow, he's shameless.

474
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,410
How could he suck up so blatantly?

475
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,580
Thank you. But respect is a little too much.

476
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,830
I really admire you.

477
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,480
- Do you not admire me?
- Sorry?

478
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm the co-developer.

479
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,660
Oh, of course, I admire you as much as your share in being the co-developer.

480
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,850
Thank you. Please act comfortably with me from now on as well.

483
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,120
What?

484
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,270
Then may I call you Hyeong Wung?

485
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,490
Excuse me, Mr. Illustrator?

486
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,620
It's fine. Please call me as you wish.

487
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,420
Hyeong-ah.

488
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,580
Wow.

489
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,230
I have my own ways. Being super friendly.

490
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,510
Isn't he some kind of weirdo?

491
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,630
Even his name is weird. Should we get someone else?

492
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,660
Why? He's kind of cute.

493
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,410
Kissing up so blatantly makes him cute.

494
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,080
Well, I guess we like the fourth dimensional.

495
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,290
But he's many levels higher than the fourth dimension.

496
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,670
You're the sixteenth dimension.

497
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,570
No, Wung. Not him. No.

498
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,980
- The key is inside.
- Thank you.

499
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,280
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

500
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,650
Hyeong Wung, just a sec.

501
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,980
What are you doing? This is the CEO's car.

502
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,220
- It's fine.
- Yes, sir.

503
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,690
Can you give me a ride to the subway station?

504
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,160
It's so cold that I might get a cold if I walked.

505
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,490
- Get in.
- Thank you.

506
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,370
It's so cold.

507
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,940
Thank you so much, Hyeong Wung.

508
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:38,940
- Where do you live?
- I live in Banghwa-dong but I'm going to Gwanghwamun right now.

509
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,440
Hyeong, please speak comfortably.

510
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,820
This is a really nice car.

511
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,480
I can't believe that I'm actually riding in this car.

I think it's better to pretend to not know me.

515
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,410
I don't think so.

516
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,430
- Did you say something?
- Huh?

I-It's nothing.

Where are you now? Are you home?

00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,450
No, not yet. I'm at a bookstore.

- We're here to tell you good news.
- Hello.

531
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,650
Do you believe in fate?

532
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,950
I'm so tired of hearing about fate.

533
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,370
It's really hard to convey the good news to Wung's village.

534
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,810
I know.

535
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,400
This village's cells like logical things, so it's hard to preach about fate.

536
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,360
We have to put so much effort into it. Goodness.

537
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,590
But let's not give up.

543
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,320
Was I too friendly when we first met?

544
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,810
I told you that things like fate have nothing to do with me.

545
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,740
That's not always true.

546
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,550

Deep inside a cave in Wung's village, a sacred ritual is conducted every morning.

All right, let's wake him up since Wung has come to work.

554
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,820
Can't he wake up on his own?

555
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,990
No, he can't.

556
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,630
His special power is only demonstrated through a ritual.

557
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,430

Close your eyes halfway and show that you're not really interested.

628
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,990
He went to the bathroom because he had a stomachache.

Either way, it's good to see you.

635
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,380
Forget all that! Since we've run into her, let's start the bragging combo!

636

Let's show her Wung's dazzling success!

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,160
Good! Bragging combo x1!

639
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,550
Yes, I'm doing well. And you?

640
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, yes, as you can see.

641
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,740
Good! Bragging combo x2!

642
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,000
Your car is really nice.

643
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,540
Is that so? It's my second car.

644
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,360
Good! Bragging Combo x3!

645
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,980
I heard that the game you made is doing really well.

646
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,680
It's not a lot. Just a little.

647
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,880
Well, it's better than before.

648
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,710
Well, I just have more money, but it's not like anything got better.

649
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,790
Because I'm so busy.

650
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,450
Excellent! Bragging combo x4!

651
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,210
Things are really hectic these days because of the overseas launch.

652
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,500
It's launching overseas, too?

653
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,820
Yes, it's already doing well in Japan and Southeast Asia.

654
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,200
Our goal is to launch in America this year.

655
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,360
Wow. Really?

656
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,830
Perfect! Bragging Combo x5!

657
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,190
Good job! He got a 5x consecutive combo!

658
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,050
Alright, now take out your CEO business card

659
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,650
and deliver the finishing combo move!

660
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,790
Oh yeah, I didn't give you my business card.

661
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,560
There is no business card.

662
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,460
That can't be! The bragging combo isn't complete without the business card!

663
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,180
Oh, no. I didn't bring my business c—

664
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,220
I don't need a business card to know.

665
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,920
I know how amazing you are.

666
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,210
I saw your interview in the magazine. You looked cool. Congratulations.

667
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,400
I knew you would be successful one day.

668
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,820
Congratulations to you, too.

669
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,160
I think I heard that you'd become a writer from somewhere.

670
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,060
Yeah. But it's nothing to be congratulated for compared to you.

671
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,920
I'm still a novice.

672
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,420
Writer Yumi!

673
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,950
I got a stomachache.

674
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,520
You two met each other already.

675
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,020
This is Bow-Wow Time's CEO Wung. And this is Writer Yumi who's working with me.

676
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,930
We already greeted each other.

677
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,050
Oh, did you say that you already knew each other?

678
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,440
I'll get off here since I met with Writer Yumi, Hyeong-nim.

679
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,300
You don't need to take me to the subway station.

680
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,570
Really? All right, then.

681
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,740
I'm going.

682
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,010
All right.

683
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,400
Bye. It was nice to see you.

684
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,350
Bye.

685
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,580
Then I'll see you at the company tomorrow, Hyeong-nim.

686
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,640
It's crazy.

687
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,360
It's really crazy.

688
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,730
How did we end up meeting again like this?

689
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,490
What's going on? Why is his heart pounding?

690
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,390
Are they crazy?

691
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,260
Hey! Don't let your heart race for someone who has a boyfriend!

692
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,650
Slammy and Thumpy, come out this instant!

693
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,500
Look here, Reason. Be careful.

694
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,880
Don't cross that line.

695
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,940
The heart is outside your control, Reason.

696
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,550
You know that you can't do anything about it, right?

697
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,180
I'm so angry.

698
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,650
Emergency dispatch!

699
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,450
An incident has occurred! An incident has occurred!

700
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,210
This is really something.

701
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,680
Pride!

702
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,060
What's going on?

703
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,830
Hey, look at this.

704
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:36,470
40 kilograms of lingering feelings were discovered in the trunk of the car.

705
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,920
If there's this much, he's basically dating her by himself.

706
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,430
What? You were smuggling in 40 kilograms of lingering feelings?

707
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,350
Your name.

708
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,980
What's your name?

709
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,250
Conscience.

710
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,790
Hey! You shouldn't be like this!

711
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:01,510
This amount can make him pathetic for six months!

712
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,780
Yumi got prettier.

713
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,110
Shut up!

714
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,840
This punk still hasn't come to his senses.

715
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,170
Where were you delivering these lingering feelings to?

716
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,850
I was delivering it to Love's house.

717
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,000
What?

718
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,830
Love, are you home? We feel bad for you.

719
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,030
I said to leave!

720
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,010
I don't believe in things like fate!

721
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,240
Kim Yumi

722
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,140
You interacted with Kim Yumi again, right?

723
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,530
Why did the illustrator who you contracted have to be the one working with Kim Yumi?

724
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,830
And from the rice cooker incident until now,

725
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,150
could this all be a simple coincidence?

726
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,380
I don't think so.

727
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,770
This is indeed fate.

728
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,750
Yes, that's right. It's fate.

729
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,300
Who cares if it's fate? Kim Yumi has a boyfriend!

730
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,110
That's what I'm saying!

731
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,710
Hey, you guys!

732
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:55,570
You guys who are acting recklessly and bullying Love!

733
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,710
Do you guys see this?

734
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,820
He got this black eye from Angela not long ago!

735
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,340
This is from getting hurt by Kim Yumi.

736
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,980
What do you want him to do when he's like this?!

737
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,750
He's barely put together and moving on.

738
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,570
Don't encourage Love!

739
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,390
Love, let's go in.

740
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,720
That's what I'm saying.

741
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,260
Fate? Yeah, right.

742
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,000
CEO.

743
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,760
Gu Wung Games

744
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,060
We're ready. Should I call a meeting?

745
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,210
Okay! Let's work! Work!

746
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,580
Let's go.

747
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,420
I haven't yet ... if I call them now, they'll be here in 30 minutes or ...

748
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,650
No, tell everyone to gather in 10 minutes.

749
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,230
I'm going to hurry up and work.

750
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,320
Yes, sir. I understand.

751
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,150
That's right. First, let's not do anything to be involved with Kim Yumi again.

752
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,890
That's wise.

753
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,440
First, let's replace that guy.

754
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,090
- What?
- Writer Kim Yumi.

755
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,210
She doesn't have a boyfriend right now.

756
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,890
They broke up a few months ago.

757
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,010
They broke up?

758
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,190
Therefore, Writer Kim Yumi is

759
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,780
perfectly single right now.

760
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,740
- Huh?
- What?

761
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,130
Love, your face is ...

762
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,570
My face? What about my face?

763
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,450
It's a strange thing.

764
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:59,500
After hearing that Yumi is single now

765
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,600
♫ The day starts as if being shoved ♫

766
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,890
the wounds he had for years were all healed.

767
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,280
♫ I spend the day ♫

768
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,820
They're all healed. ♫ constantly acting fearless ♫

769
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,780
What the ...!

770
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,360
Where did the pictures in the safe go?

771
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,670
The rage energy deep inside his heart disappeared too.

772
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,860
Only one thought captivated Wung.

773
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,270
The thing is ... Illustrator Z.

774
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:32,700
Yes, Hyeong-nim?

775
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,580
Can I speak comfortably?

776
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,120
Of course, Hyeong-nim.

777
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,880
Okay.

778
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,030
♫ Pathetically with a thud ♫

779
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,630
I also have a favor to ask of you. ♫ landing on the floor I am crying ♫

780
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,810
What is it? ♫ today, too ♫

781
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:51,970
Can you help me a bit?

782
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,110
What can I help you with?

783
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,140
- That's ...
- Feel free to tell me.

784
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,460
The thing is ...

785
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:10,390
To ask for this is a bit difficult, since we don't know each other well.

786
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,980
Do you want to date Writer Yumi again?

787
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,730
Is that it, Hyeong Wung?

788
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,470
Answer me.

789
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:23,940
If it's a little embarrassing to answer, then how about a high-five?

790
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,830
High-five!

791
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,560
Okay, message received.

792
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,790
I told you, right? That us meeting is fate.

793
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:47,090
Can you please stop being ridiculous?

794
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,430
♫ Over a crushed heart happiness ♫

795
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,820
Yes, we finally acknowledged

796
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:04,460
what Yumi meant to Wung.

797

00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,180
♫ courage ♫

802
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,900
How do you think Yumi feels?
♫ let's be a little ♫

803
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,800
Does Wung still have a chance? ♫ happier ♫

804
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:39,820
♫ I'm going tonight to the shining place ♫

805
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,530
Yi Da

806
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,120
♫ We are going to ♫

807
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,370
Hey Yi Da. What's up first thing in the morning?
♫ the shining place ♫

808
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:50,280
Hey! Do you know who I just ran into?

809
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,670
Who?

810
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,200
Daehan Noodles

811
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,350
Assistant Manager Yi Da.

812
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,190
It's been a while.

813
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,150
Assistant Manager Ba Bi, I mean Team Leader.

814
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,620
I'm really surprised to see you.

815
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,960
Did you come from Jeju Island for a meeting?

816
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,550
No. I've been sent back to the head office as of today.

817
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,120
Then are you in the marketing department?

818
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,900
Yes. I'm here as the Team Leader of the Marketing Department.

819
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,090
Ba Bi came back to Seoul?

820
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:41,820
♫ Did you doze off last night again? ♫

821
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:47,300
♫ Are you standing at the end of your path? ♫

822
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,380
♫ Close your eyes and come into my arms ♫

823
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,010
♫ Everything is all right ♫

824
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:03,320
♫ I can't even express it in words ♫

825
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,910
♫ After a rainy day, like a ray of light ♫

826
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:13,340
♫ I think you who only convey happy memories ♫

827
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,640
Yumi's Cells 2
Preview

828
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,800
Team Leader Ba Bi's home is in your neighborhood.

829
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,910
I thought you might be surprised if you run into him.

830
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,670
Hyeong Wung! What a coincidence we meet again like this.

831
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,180
Is this coincidence or fate?

832
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,010
We caught you, Kim Yumi.

833
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,320
Love, you were alive!

834
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,280
Then if she starts dating, you can come back to the village.

835
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,890
I don't make you uncomfortable, right?

836
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,740
Then let's see each other occasionally like this.

837
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,490
I probably won't see her again.

838
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,780
♫ So that you can breathe within me ♫

839
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,130
I missed you so much.

840
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:58,860
♫ Darkness and loneliness entirely will cease to exist ♫
