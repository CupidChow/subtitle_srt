Yumi's Cells 2

00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,960
Episode 36
Extremely Polite Yumi

3
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,160
Yumi.

4
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,880
Should we ...

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,020
get married?

6
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,890
Let's get married.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
The sky is pretty.

8
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,210
- Eonni Yi Da, good morning!
- Hey, good morning.

9
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,510
Wow. It's been so long since she made a comeback on here.

10
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,670
I'm talking about Yumi. She restored her account. What's going on?

11
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,530
Really? I'll have to leave a comment.

12
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,900
A nice day for a change. Spring. A new feeling. A good hunch.

13
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,290
So she just uploaded it.

14
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,650
Wait. This isn't just a normal picture she uploaded.

15
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,350
Why?

16
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,040
- Hello?
- Hey, is there something going on?

17
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,550
Huh? 
- Hurry up and come clean, something good happened, right?

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,100
Yeah.

19
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,040
Listen. Ruby and Writer Yumi are having dinner together today.

20
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm going to act as if I came to look for Ruby and join in.

21
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,580
Then if Hyeong and Hyeong Wung will pretend you just happened to come to that restaurant for dinner

22
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
I'll naturally invite you to join us.

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,190
So I'll get there first and you guys come in ten minutes later. Then we'll meet.

24
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,390
But you said that Yumi is dating her ex-boyfriend again. So isn't it already game over?

25
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,440
No, no, no. Don't dare call it love, if you haven't tried your best.

26
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,720
Isn't that something that stalkers say?

27
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,660
So you don't trust me, Hyeong-nim.

28
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,290
You can trust me when it comes to dating.

29
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,070
Based on what?

30
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,970
Do you know why people watch me, Control Z, and call me Control Z?

31
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,420
No, but I'm not really that curious.

32
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,070
It's a bit embarrassing to say it myself,

33
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,720
but I'm a dating expert.

34
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,670
You must have a lot of dating experience then.

35
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,220
Rather than a lot, it's deep.

36
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,440
About how many times...?

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,570
You already know that rather than how many relationships you've had,

38
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,860
it is more important how deep a relationship is, right?

39
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,440
When I'm in a relationship, I'm the prudent type who stays in a relationship for a long time. That's all I'll say.

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,550
I got it, so how many times?

41
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,170
Officially, three times.

42
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,800
Three times?

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,390
Three times. Hey, I have more than seven times.

44
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,810
How dare you act like a know-it-all when you've only dated three times?

45
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,670
- Hey.
- Huh?

46
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,620
Did you say seven times? You?

47
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,210
Yeah.

48
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,330
Really?

49
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,850
Well...

50
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,870
I'm saying it's seven times if you include flirting.

51
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,570
You said it's seven times if you include flirting?

52
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,770
Hyeong-nim, I would have been in a relationship over 30 times if I included flirting.

53
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,030
Wait, if you've only dated seven times including flirting, then this is not something to laugh at.

54
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,250
It's something serious.

55
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,340
- Really?
- Of course. It's serious enough that you need to take a good look at your life again.

56
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,440
Hyeong Wung, I can assure you that Writer Yumi is lonely right now.

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,510
Although they're back together, it's awkward.

58
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,260
A relationship like this can't last long.

59
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,540
Now's your chance.

60
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,480
"Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."
(A Benjamin Franklin quote)

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,390
Why does he look like he is some pseudo-religious leader?

62
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,110
Just in time, it's Ruby. I'll lay the groundwork.

63
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,900
Ruby.

64
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,620
Hello?

65
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,580
- Oppa Z!
- Hey, Ruby. I was actually going to call you—

66
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,270
Oppa Z! Big news! Big news!

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,920
Eonni Yumi said she's getting married!

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,570
With Team Leader Ba Bi. She said he proposed to her.

69
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,350
I thought things weren't going well for them, but this is a big twist!

70
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh, I have to go to a meeting. I'll call you back.

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,540
Ruby ❤️

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Wait... Are you telling me that Miss Yumi's getting married to her ex-boyfriend right now?

73
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,370
Hello?

74
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,350
What are you up to?

75
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm drinking coffee, cleaning, and cooking.

76
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,310
I didn't tell you yesterday, did I?

77
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,410
Tell me what?

78
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,710
I've always had a feeling that I'd live happily when I got married.

79
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,340
What is the basis for that feeling?

80
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,870
A strong signal came to me from the future.

81
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,730
What are you saying?

82
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,190
But I became certain that it's not just a hunch yesterday.

83
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,100
I think we'll be happy.

84
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,730
You don't have much going on today, right? Do you want to go out for lunch?

85
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,000
- Lunch? I'm making a lunchbox right now.
- Oh.

86
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,850
There was somewhere I wanted to go with you.

87
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,860
Where?

88
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,570
Your father?

89
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,410
Huh? Aunt, Su Cheol didn't get divorced. It was the younger sibling that got divorced.

90
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,140
Su Cheol doesn't have a younger sibling.

91
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,740
What? Why doesn't he have a younger sibling? He has two of them.

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,510
Then what's the youngest one's name?

93
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,120
What is it?

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,820
Yumi, who grew up around many adult relatives since she was young,

95
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,570
has never found it difficult to interact with elders.

96
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,510
Do you have a boyfriend? Did you get a job?

97
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,410
No, I don't have a boyfriend, and I'm getting ready to get a job.

98
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,940
Is that so?

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,600
However...
[Thirty Years of Traditional Street Food Tteokbokki (Spicy Rice Cake)]

100
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,560
it's different in terms of her boyfriend's father.
Ba Bi's Street Food

101
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,850
But is it okay for me to suddenly meet him like this?

102
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,150
I thought that you'd feel more burdened if we made plans to meet him.

103
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,830
We can say that we decided to stop in since we were passing by,

104
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,160
greet him, and then leave.

105
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,630
Let's take the formal meeting slow.

106
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,320
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

107
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,830
You look pretty.

108
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,860
Welcome.

109
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,580
Father!

110
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,010
I stopped by.

111
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,570
Why did you come here with your foot like that? You should be at home.

112
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,170
I came with my girlfriend.

113
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,660
That's Ba Bi's father?

114
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,560
He doesn't look like his son at all.

115
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
He looks scarier than his picture.

116
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,270
He looks like an actor.

117
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,060
Who does he look like?

118
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,020
These guys!

119
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,790
You all need to get yourselves together!

120
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,770
Is it important which actor he looks like right now?

121
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,870
He's going to be our father-in-law!

122
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,390
You think marriage is easy?

123
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,130
Don't you know if we make a mistake, we'll get tackled here!

124
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,280
Say hello. He's my father.

125
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,370
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yumi.

126
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,690
Nice to meet you.

127
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,750
If you were going to come, you should have let me know beforehand.

128
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,520
I'm sorry. We had plans nearby, so we stopped by.

129
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,190
We thought it would be good to say hello.

130
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,100
Oh, this is ...

131
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,490
Oh! Yumi bought it to give to you.

132
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,100
You didn't have to.

133
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,120
Oh it's nothing, it's just snacks.

134
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,930
We don't have any food because our lunch service is over.

135
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,070
We've only got tteokbokki left now, unfortunately.

136
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,230
Oh, no, it's fine. I really like tteokbokki.

137
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,680
Tteokbokki (rice cakes), Sundae (blood sausage), Ramen (noodles), Kimbap (Seaweed wrapped rice rolls)

138
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,070
The ambience of the restaurant is so nice.

139
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,210
It's been around for a while, so it's outdated, right?

140
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,070
No. That's why it looks more charming. It really looks as if the food will be delicious.

141
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,800
My father has always been brusque. Even more so after my mother passed away.

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,430
I know, you told me.

143
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,770
He's like that with everyone, so don't worry about it.

144
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Yes, Miss Bon Hui?

145
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm out at the moment.

146
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,160
Pardon? You even need an ID card?

147
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,410
I'll send it to you as a photo.

148
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,920
Fax? But why does it have to—

149
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,760
Yes, I understand. I'll call you once I've sent it.

150
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,850
Yumi, I'll be just a second.

151
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,480
Do you need to go somewhere?

152
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I just need to go send a fax and I'll be back.

153
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,100
- I'll go.
- No.

154
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,450
I need to go myself.

155
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,450
Father, Mr. Yeong Gu's stationary store is open, right?

156
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,700
Of course, it's open.

157
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,660
Now, what is the most polite thing you can do to someone who made you food?

158
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,550
Of course it's to eat everything deliciously, so there's nothing left over!

159
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,390
Exactly! That is the best courtesy!

160
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,990
That's true, but this is ...

161
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,440
Father, that's too much.

162
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,140
Then leave leftovers.

163
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,240
There's too much.

164
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,740
I'll be right back. Go ahead and eat.

165
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,680
Sure. Hurry back.

166
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,360
How many portions is that exactly?! Three? Four?

167
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,450
Even if it's polite, this is too much.

168
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,760
Hold on! It's too early to be scared.

169
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,640
Ba Bi's Street Food's tteokbokki is made of wheat rice cakes. That's my specialty.

170
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,660
So should I show you my skills?

171
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,580
Who do you think you are? You're going to take all of us on?

172
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,010
You'd better start preparing yourselves!

173
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,480
When it comes to tteokbokki, I still don't know my limits.

174
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,730
I think he's serious!

175
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,570
Where are you guys running off to?

176
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,390
My back!

177
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,680
You can't run away from this plate!

178
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,110
I'm not a rice cake, I'm a green onion.

179
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,310
Sorry, you look the same.

180
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,490
It's delicious, so delicious. Even the green onion is good.

181
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,240
I can't even compare it to when I had it as take-out. The taste is amazing.

182
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,190
Yumi! You need to eat modestly here.

183
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,120
Don't act frivolously.

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,970
She's not saying anything. Does it not suit her taste?

185
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,290
No, that's not it.

186
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,880
That's the feet bounce.

187
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,920
Feet Bounce: A performance you do when you eat delicious food.

188
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,820
It's like a standing ovation at a performance venue.

189
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,310
And she's even mopping up the sauce.

190
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:45,320
Mopping up the leftover sauce is the highest form of praise in the tteokbokki industry.

191
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,820
Yumi scored high on her first impression.

192
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,500
You ate all of this by yourself?

193
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,990
It was so yummy...

194
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,550
- Oh, I'll clean—
- No need.

195
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,180
Yumi must have really enjoyed your tteokbokki.

196
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,120
There's none for you.

197
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,070
I'm okay.

198
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,690
If you're done eating, then get going.

199
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,180
All right.

200
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,810
Is he angry?

201
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,390
No. He's always like that.

202
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,930
We'll be going now.

203
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,670
Bye.

204
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,980
- Should we go?
- I need to use the restroom.

205
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,530
Okay.

206
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,230
He's so brusque. I have no idea what to say.

207
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,330
Still, we can't just eat and leave.

208
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,290
I can't just leave.

209
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,280
In that case, it's time for a transformation!

210
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,140
Transformation: The ability to temporarily transform into a cell by maximizing the characteristic

211
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,460
of that one cell. It does not last more than thirty minutes.

We'll be going then.

Go on.

228
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,230
Let's go Yumi.

229
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,240
I really enjoyed the meal.

230
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,270
Full of Manners Yumi: Manners increased by 300%. Filial daughter state as bonus.

231
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,720
It was no problem. Tteokbokki isn't that special.

232
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,950
I'm truly sorry for visiting so unexpectedly.

233
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,120
Next time, we'll be sure to contact you before we come.

234
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,460
It's fine. I would like it if you came to visit again.

235
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,330
And I'm glad you enjoyed the tteokbokki.

236
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,030
Well, get going.

237
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,590
Yes. I'll come and visit you again,

238

Fa—

239
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,760
Fa?

240
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,120

244
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,400
You did well. What mistake? He'll like it if you stop by occasionally.

245
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,610
Hold on.

246
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,720
What is it?

247
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,740
- Yumi*.
- Yes?

248
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,340
Here.

249
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,190
Buy something delicious to eat.

250
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,250
Take it.

251
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,190
Thank you.

252
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,350

Since I got spending money, I'll use this to pay. What do you want to drink?

256
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,130
Do you know what my father's nickname is?

257
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,350
What is it?

258
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,360
Old Man Scrooge.

259
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,410
Why? He gave me spending money.

260
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,440
I've never even once gotten any.

261
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,810
Really?

262
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:48,360
Just know that you're the first person to ever get spending money from my father.

263
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,080
Wow. Then I shouldn't use this and laminate it to commemorate.

264
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,930
Hang it up on the wall.

265
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,080
I should iron this and laminate it.

266
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,660
Wow, you're rich now.

267
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,430
Yumi safely made it through the first hurdle on the road to marriage.

268
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,950
You know that's really important, right?

269
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,540
I'm jealous. I've never once gotten any before.

270

I'll get a lot from him.

I'm here to challenge the dojo. Come out, dojo master!

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,120
That would be good. But will you be able to?

281
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,410
There isn't a lot to edit—

282
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,890
Writer, did you catch a cold?

283

I don't know. My throat is sore.

- All right. I'll see you next week.
 - All right!

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,010

Hey! Where is that jerk Cold?

Shall I stop by for a bit?

308
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,080
No. I think I'll get better if I just rest today.

I think it would be good if I stopped by for a bit.

I'll be all right, really. I'm sorry.

It's all right, get some rest.

00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,650
- Okay. Call me later.
- All right.

313
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,780
Should I not have told him? He'll worry.

314
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,980
Yumi, are you busy?

315
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,320
I came to Ilsan for work, so I thought of you.

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm not at home. What is it?

317

There's no reason for us to meet since we don't work together nor are friends,

318
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,940
however, do you want to have a cup of coffee?

319
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,040
All right, Yumi is coming soon. Let's speak coolly.

320
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,260
As if we're just asking how she's doing.

321
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,810
Show me the best answer.

322
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,700
[Which of the following is the coolest way to greet Yumi?]
A. Yumi, congratulations. I heard that you're getting married soon.

323
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,860
B. I heard you were proposed to. That's great.

324
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,400
C. Mr. Yu Ba Bi is a good man. You made a good decision.

325
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
A good man? What BS is that.

326
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,850
Does he really have to say that?

327
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,160
Hey. Hey, Love. Calm down.

328
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,800
We can just move on!

329
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,360
Do we really have to ask to see her and say this?

330
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,920
Love! This is something that makes Yumi happy.

331
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,800
It's the same as leaving comments on her web novel.

332
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,080
What's so hard about wishing her well?

333
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,600
I don't want to do it! Why do I have to go this far?

334
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,690
Wung.

335
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,950
Hey. You made it?

336
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,250
What do you want to drink?

337
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,320
No, I don't need anything.

338
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,830
I had some tea right before I came, so I'm okay.

339
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,640
Are you sick?

340
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,150
I must have a cold. I'm okay.

341
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,190
How have you been?

342
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,220
What about your finger?

343
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,580
It's fine.

344
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,440
That's a relief.

345
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,720
Congratulations.

346
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
Huh?

347
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,160
About that.

348
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,760
That?

349
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,420
You getting that thing.

350
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,890
Being proposed to.

351
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,460
Thank you.

352
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,910
I didn't think that you'd say that to me.

353
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,250
Thank you.

354
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,340
No need to be thankful.

355
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,350
Look at that. Yumi's happy.

356
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,790
Don't get married, Yumi!

357
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,920
I contacted you because I wanted to tell you that.

358
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,420
I could say it over the phone, but still...

359
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,090
Yeah.

360
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,630
When are you getting married?

361
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,200
Not right away. I think it will be better after I finish writing the sequel.

362
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,460
So it will probably be late fall or winter. We're thinking around November or December.

363
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,930
Oh, I see.

364
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,030
It's still far away, so it doesn't feel real.

365
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,500
Are you happy?

366
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,620
Yeah.

367
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,830
I think I am happy.

368
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,290
That's good.

369
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,660
Good for you.

370
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,320
When you get married, send me a wedding invitation, too.

371
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm not sure.

372
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,640
Why?

373
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,240
You can't do that either because I'm your ex-boyfriend?

374
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,360
I'll discuss it with him.

375
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,750
With your boyfriend?

376
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes. I think I should ask him.

377
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,350
Then I won't be able to go. Would Yu Ba Bi allow it?

378
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,350
Why are you acting like that? Are you still upset with Ba Bi?

379
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,070
Do you have to get married to that guy?

380
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,120
If you're going to do it, can't you do it with some other guy instead?

381
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,360
Why does it have to be that guy?

382
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,540
Wung.

383
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,960
It's been a while since I had the impulse to say this.

384
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,020
Say what?

385
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,970
Aigoo.

386
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,390
Aigoo, Wung.

387
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,260
I'll take you home.

388
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,730
- That's okay.
- It's because you look sick.

389
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,420
It's fine. My house is right around the corner.

390
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,610
Can I say one more thing?

391
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,110
You said enough.

392
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,850
Do you know what I regret the most in my life?

393
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,830
It's when I couldn't answer when you asked if I wanted to marry you.

394
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,500
I thought I would have another chance after I earned some money.

395
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,760
Do you love that guy?

396
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,010
Do you love him?

397
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,630
Of course! Yeah!

398
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,460
Huh? Why isn't she saying anything? "Yes!"

399
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,060
What are you doing? Yumi, you have to answer him!

400
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,240
Say that you love him! Say yes!

401
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,480
She can't answer.

402
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,920
- Why?
- Love isn't here!

403
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,410
Huh?

404
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,330
Love!

405
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,230
- I haven't seen Love either.
- Love, where are you?

406
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,150
You're saying Love isn't here?

407
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,430
Love hasn't come back yet.

408
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,440
Is that possible? Hasn't any one seen Love?

409
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,100
- I haven't.
- No.
I ❤️ YUMI

410
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,990
- Have you seen her?
- No.

411
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,380
Love is the only one who can answer when asked if she loves him.

412
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,490
But you said that Love isn't here!

413
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,550
That's why she can't say yes.

414
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,520
Darn it! Then I'll just answer it!

415
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,360
Why are you asking something so obvious?!

416
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,350
Why are you asking something so obvious? How childish.

417
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,320
I've always been childish. You know that.

418
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,510
Hurry up and go.

419
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,080
Bye.

420
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,200
Go home.

421
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,610
When I wondered what love was,

422
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,940
I realized it was when I couldn't control how I felt.

423
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,660
Congratulations. Be happy.

424
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,220
Hey! Why won't you die? It's 39°C (102.2°F) out here!

425
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,220
It's still bearable. Why?!

426
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,650
Hey! We'll all die first at this rate.

427
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,430
I don't care. Let's see who'll win!

428
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,250
Let's go over 39.5 degrees!

429
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,200
Do you have to go this far just to get rid of one cold?

430
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,990
You stupid fool ...

431
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,700
You're crazy!

432
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,900
We'll all die. Lower the temperature.

433
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,290
We don't have a function to lower the temperature, though.

434
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,390
Wait, why wouldn't you— Are you determined to kill Yumi?!

435
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,690
Huh? It suddenly got cooler.

436
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,710
It's Ba Bi.

437
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,680
Are you okay?

438
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,060
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.

439
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,900
You've got a really high fever. Should we go to the hospital?

440
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,210
It's not that bad. What about work?

441
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,430
I worked outside the office and got off work from there.

442
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,750
Let's monitor it a little longer and go to the hospital if it doesn't get any lower.

443
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,020
You didn't eat dinner either, did you? You have to eat something to get better.

444
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,650
I'm not hungry.

445
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,550
Get some more sleep.

446
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,220
♫ It's not about something I can understand ♫

447
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,040
♫ To me who am spending an unexpected day ♫

448
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,600
♫ Sing a song song song song song ♫

449

450
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,870
♫ Can't think the word that I wanna say ♫

451
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,550
♫ To me who is about to cry ♫

452
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:19,050
♫ Sing a song song song song song ♫

453
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:26,120
♫ so that I can feel your love love love love ♫

454
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,450
Who is it?

455
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,190
Who was it?

456
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,880
My father sent you some tteokbboki.

457
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,520
What?
 30 years of traditional tteokbboki - Babi's Street Food

458
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,800
I spoke with him on the phone earlier,

459
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,260
and when I said that you're sick, he asked me for your address.

460
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,870
He said that since you eat tteokbboki so well, you should eat some if you don't have an appetite.

461
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,280
Do you want some? The rice porridge is almost ready, too.

462
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,230
I'm so thankful.

463
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,090
Have the rice porridge first. Let's eat the tteokbboki when you get a little better.

464
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,340
Okay.

465
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,220
Get some more sleep.

466
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm so touched.

467
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm so touched! I'm touched by Ba Bi and his father!

468
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,680
Why are they so sweet?

469
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,490
When Yumi's sick, her emotions are more intense than usual.

470
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,420
Is being sweet hereditary for the men in this family?

471
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,250
Oh my goodness! I'm going crazy!

472
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:29,030
Ah, Yumi. Isn't it so great that you are getting married?

473
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,620
Eat some more.

474
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,390
I ate a lot. It's so delicious.

475
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,610
Shall we check?

476
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,290
I think it went down a bit.

477
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,090
Aren't you going to eat dinner?

478
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:59,190
I'll take care of it. Go back to sleep.

479
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,100
I'll take this away.

480
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,450
Oh, that's right. Yumi, what do you think about Hawaii?

481
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,500
- Hawaii?
- I told you that my older sister lives in Hawaii.

482
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:22,120
What do you think about getting married in Hawaii? I suddenly thought of it.

483
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,570
It was really nice every time I visited my sister's place.

484
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,180
A small wedding in Hawaii?

485
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,030
A small wedding in Hawaii.

486
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,070
What? Are you saying that because you know?

487
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,260
That it's my dream to have a small wedding in Hawaii?

488
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,420
Really? I didn't know. How would I know that?

489
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,240
Then, you're saying it's really a coincidence?

490
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,860
Wow.

491
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,190
I like that! I would love that.

492
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,470
I knew you would like it.

493
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,240
Get some more sleep. You're sick.

494
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,160
I think it would be nice to have a small wedding in Hawaii.

495
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
Yes. Let's talk about it again later.

496
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,870
Go to sleep.

497
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,710
Ha-Hawaii?

498
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,450
Don't talk anymore. Go back to sleep.

499
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,540
Since you're sick.

500
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,610
I think a small wedding in Hawaii would be so nice.

501
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,970
How can this be?

502
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,220
How is it that even his older sister lives in Hawaii?

503
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,230
I thought that we'd end up having a small wedding in Hawaii with Wung.

504
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,870
You really never know how things will turn out.

505
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,490
Life is mysterious.

506
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,760
When she's sick, she gets twice as touched and twice as annoyed.

507
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,990
She also fantasizes twice as much.

508
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,620
Yumi, are you awake?

509
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,600
Your fever went down.

510
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,850
How do you feel?

511
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,680
I think I'm okay now.

512
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,210
Ba Bi, hurry up and go.

513
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,370
I'm not going to go.

514
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,430
You have to go to work tomorrow.

515
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,620
I'll just go from here.

516
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,110
You seem like you've gotten a little better, so I'll go buy some beer.

517
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,130
A soccer game is on soon.

518
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,000
I'll have some beer and watch it before I go to bed.

519
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,240
I'll be back.

520
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,810
You can't go.

521
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,400
I can't?

522
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,460
Go ahead.

523
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,990
Ba Bi's Street Food.

524
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,110
His sweetness and his cooking skills must be hereditary.

525
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,220
He's perfect!

526
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,180
I should wash my face.

527
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,020
What's with this look?

528
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,580
Did he leave his phone?

529
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,340
Yu Da Eun (Intern)

530
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,830
Yu Da Eun (Intern)

531
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:58,350
Missed Call from Yu Da Eun (Intern)

532
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,070
The wedding invitation has arrived!

533
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,520
Episode 38: The Wedding Invitation

534
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:23,020
Eight months later

535
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,970
Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching Incheon International Airport.

536
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:33,460
Please keep the seat back and table in place, and keep large electronic devices

537
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,430
such as luggage or laptops under the front seat or on the shelf again.

538
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,450
Thank you.

539
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,350
Sir, you're tired, aren't you? You couldn't get any rest as soon as you arrived.

540
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,080
I slept the whole plane ride, so not really.

541
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,420
Miss Seo Yeon said she was bringing clothes for you to change into.

542
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,580
And this is your mail that came while you were on the business trip.

543
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,120
Why is there so much?

544
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,320
Sincerely, Park Yong Seon & Lee Som Yi

545
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,420
Yong Seon, that punk, is getting married.

546
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,150
Seok Ju is, too.

547
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,660
Are these guys all getting married one after another?

548
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,460
They're all wedding invitations.

549
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,730
From: Kim Yumi

550
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,100
To: Gu Wung

551
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,210
When you get married, send me a wedding invitation, too.

552
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm not sure. I'll discuss it with him.

553
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,400
All right, guys. Let's hold hands.

554
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,380
That day has finally come.

555
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,920
You've prepared your heart, right?

556
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,510
We got rid of all the lingering feelings.

557
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,890
We decided to calmly let Yumi go.

558
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,290
We're right. It is a wedding invitation.
[Invitation]

559
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,860
Seriously...
[Invitation]

560
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,300
Why is the wedding invitation so pretty?

561
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,630
Yumi probably picked it out, right?

562
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,630
- I don't want to look at it.
- I don't want to see ...

563
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,750
- that her groom is Yu Ba Bi!
- Damn it.

564
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,420
Special Guest Lecture for Startup Executives - Ku Woong Games CEO Gu Wung
Date: November 23, 2023, Location: Julie Center

565
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,720
Convention Centre

566
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,010
Sir, we've arrived.

567
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,750
All right.

568
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,500
That's right, let's look at it later.

569
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,320
It'll just ruin the lecture.

570
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,200
Sir, you're going straight home instead of the company office, right?

571
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,900
I'll go home and wash up.

572
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,640
Please schedule the meeting after four o'clock.

573
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,030
Yes, sir.

574
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,930
- Please go to Hannam-do.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,100
This is Yumi's neighborhood.

576
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,920
It's our old neighborhood, too.

577
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,190
That was when we had the least money, but were the happiest.

578
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,650
One moment. Please stop the car.

579
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,240
Please take my luggage to my place. I'll head straight to the company.

580
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,170
Where are you going, sir?

581
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,480
There's somewhere I want to stop by.

582
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,950
Then you should take the car ...

583
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,200
When he would get off work, Yumi would wait for him there.

584
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,380
Wung!

585
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,560
Come in!

586
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,010
Put it there.

587
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,660
- Put it down there.
- Huh?

588
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,660
Isn't that sofa from Yumi's place?

589
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,410
You're right. That's Yumi's bookcase.

590
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,670
Is she moving to Ba Bi's place?

591
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,780
Or to a new newlywed home?

592
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,750
Newlywed home?

593
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,370
Don't cry, Love.

594
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,290
We said we would smile when she gets married.

595
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,160
Stop!

596
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,900
While we're here, let's say hi to Yumi before we go.

597
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,370
Yes, let's tell her we look forward to seeing her in her wedding dress.

598
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,910
Yumi!

599
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,940
Yumi!

600
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,410
It's the dining table that Wung bought for her.

601
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:18,070
The dining table that he bought with borrowed money because he didn't have 1,500,000 won (≈ $1,145).

602
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,690
Sir, we will take the dining table out now.

603
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,400
Sure, but where is the tenant?

604
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,170
Are you not her husband?

605
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,510
No, I'm not.

606
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,590
I thought you were her husband.

607
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,860
She said she had to stop by somewhere for a bit and left.

608
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,480
Please be careful.

609
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,450
She's even taking that dining table to the newlywed home?

610
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,020
She's going to even eat at that dining table with that jerk ...

611
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,830
He didn't buy it for that to happen ...

612
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,020
There you go again! If you're going to be like this, let's just go.

613
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,230
We're not going to see Yumi.

614
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,240
Come on, let's just go. Come on.

615
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,880
- Let's just go.
- Let's just go.

616
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,740
Yes, the deposit went through. I verified it.

617
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,170
Thank you so much.

618
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,160
- Thank you.
- No problem.

619
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,580
- Get home safely.
- I will.

620
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,500
Hunjeong Real Estate

621
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,440
Wung!

622
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,970
It was you.

623
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,860
What are you doing here?

624
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,080
I had a lecture nearby, so I stopped by.

625
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,790
I see.

626
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,780
I'm here because of my house.

627
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,820
Congratulations.

628
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,330
You know?

629
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,940
Of course, I know.

630
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,680
So you heard. Thanks.

631
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,350
But I don't know if it was a good idea. I took out a big loan.

632
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,820
You took out the loan?

633
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,700
Of course, I would.

634
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,020
I mean ... Was that necessary for you to do?

635
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,120
I don't have enough money, so what else would I do?

636
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,730
What the heck, Yu Ba Bi? You're making Yumi take out a loan to get married?

637
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:46,130
He has no conscience. If they're going to get married like that then Wung would have married Yumi by now!

638
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,000
That's right.

639
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,850
Guys, please stop!

640
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,550
I mean ... well ...

641
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,930
It's none of my business.

642
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,140
I will pay off the debt slowly.

643
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,780
Exactly, why are you the one paying that debt—

644
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:06,170
Yes, anyway, congratulations.

645
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,850
That's not important anyway.

646
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:13,570
Still, I'm excited.

647
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,900
As long as you are happy.

648
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,440
You got the wedding invitation, right? I sent it.

649
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,590
Yeah.

650
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,400
Are you coming to the wedding?

651
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,750
Of course.

652
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,240
I'm glad.

653
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,890
Why? Did you think I wouldn't go?

654
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,370
Possibly. I thought it was a 50/50 chance.

655
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,820
It's too bad. It would have been nice to grab a coffee,

656
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,850
but I have to get back. They're moving out my things right now.

657
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,050
Head back. I'm also leaving now.

658
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,650
A taxi is coming.

659
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:53,890
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

660
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,570
I'll see you at the wedding.

661
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,250
Okay.

662
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,770
I will look forward to seeing you in your wedding dress.

663
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,690
What?

664
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:17,720
I think you will look really beautiful.

665
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,830
Bye.

666
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,020
What? Me?

667
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,680
Hold on. Wasn't there something weird about the end of that conversation just now?

668
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,860
It was weird. Something was off.

669
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,380
The wedding invitation! Check the wedding invitation!

670
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,030
What the! What's this?

671
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,710
The bride isn't Kim Yumi!
[Bride - Kang Yi Da]

672
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,890
Kang Yi Da?!
[Groom - Ahn Dae Yong]

673
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,210
Yumi's friend, Kang Yi Da?

674
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,450
Yi Da was debating on whether she should give you a wedding invitation.

675
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,760
Some time ago when we went out for drinks you told her to send you an invitation whenever she gets married.

676
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,090
Sir, please drive backwards.

677
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,460
Sure.

678
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,830
- Excuse me?!
- Please drive backwards. Backwards!

679
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,470
Right now?

680
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,840
I said go back! Go back!

681
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,410
So I am sending one on her behalf. She won't be hurt if you don't come. Yumi.

682
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,470
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

683
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:34,740
Wung!

684
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,690
It's Yi Da's wedding.

685
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:38,130
What?

686
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,570
- The wedding invitation. It's Yi Da's wedding invitation.
- Yeah.

687
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,390
Then what we're you just talking about?

688
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,110
You weren't talking about coming to Yi Da's wedding?

689
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,740
Why are you moving?

690
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,870
- Moving?
- You moved out all of your furniture.

691
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,350
I saw them putting it into the moving truck.

692
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,090
I bought my apartment.

693
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,310
I thought it was a waste to keep paying rent,

694
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:03,300
so I took my deposit and took out a loan to buy the place even though it was a little impractical.

695
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,050
Since I bought it, I'm going to put in new wallpaper and flooring.

696
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,480
That's why I'm moving everything to storage.

697
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,660
You weren't congratulating me on buying an apartment?

698
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,570
No.

699
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,870
Then what were you talking about earlier?

700
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,760
- I thought you knew.
- What about you?

701
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,370
Me?

702
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,450
Your wedding?

703
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,140
Are you not getting married? You said you'd do it this year.

704
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,520
Oh ...

705
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,770
I'm not.

706
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,470
Then when are you going to do it?

707
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,640
We broke up.

708
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,170
I guess you didn't know. I thought you had heard.

709
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:55,320
I— I didn't know.

710
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,140
That's what happened.

711
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,590
I see.

712
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,990
I didn't know, sorry.

713
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,360
It's fine.

714
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,750
Then I'll see you at Yi Da's wedding.

715
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,720
All right.

716
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,340
I'll get going.

717
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,060
Okay.

718
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,010
Sir, let's go, please.

719
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,660
But why ...

720
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:45,430
Wung probably wanted to ask why we broke up.

721
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,450
Goodbye, ajeossi.
[Eight months ago.]

722
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,650

♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

724
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,520
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,850

That's enough ...

726
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,170

728
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:27,760

729
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,220
Calling Team Leader Yu Ba Bi

730
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,840
Yu Da Eun (Intern)

731
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,070
That's a relief he didn't answer.

732
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,670
Team Leader Yu Ba Bi

733
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,970
That's a relief.

734
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,250
I didn't know this was love.

735
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:02,190
When I couldn't control how I felt.

736
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,900
Will she want to eat tteokbokki?

737
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,970
Yumi, are you sleeping?

738
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,050
Missed call from Yu Da Eun (Intern)

739
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,850
Yu Da Eun (Intern)

740
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,980
Delete contact.

741
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,530
The contact has been deleted.

742
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,620
How are you feeling?

743
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,650
I'm fine. I think I'm all better.

744
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,420
Then let's eat breakfast.

745
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,040
Okay.

746
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,450
Did you reply?

747
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,760
Huh?

748
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,030
To your father. Did you reply back?

749
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,880
That the tteokbokki arrived all right.

750
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,200
Oh ... No.

751
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,180
I will have to do it. I will call him later.

752
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,080
You don't have to. I will tell him later.

753
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:13,890
Still, wouldn't he like it more if I did it?

754
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:15,980
Of course, he would.

755
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,610
The reason we broke up

756
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,950
Yu Da Eun (Intern)

757
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:12,120
is not because Da Eun called Ba Bi in the middle of the night,

758
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,500
is also not because Ba Bi still has Da Eun's number saved in his contacts.

759
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,040
The reason we broke up is

760
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,590
because even though I saw that

761
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:29,790
I was calm.

762
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:51,960
How could someone in love be calm?
