1
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,791
Help!

2
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,583
Help me!

3
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,208
In order to rescue Keiko and Yukina,

4
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,666
Yusuke and the others
went to Kubikukuri Island.

5
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,541
Still unaware of Genkai's death,
Yusuke fought against Younger Toguro.

6
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,750
Now let's see it.

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,375
The power she gave you.

8
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,041
What did you say?

9
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,083
Meanwhile, roundworm monsters
began to pour out of the hole

10
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,666
opened by the sinkhole.

11
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:10,833
Sakyo wanted to connect the Demon World
to the Human World and summon yokai.

12
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:11,833
Is it

13
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,916
even possible

14
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,208
to stop him?

15
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,583
Bastard…

16
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,750
I guess I'll hold back
a little less this time.

17
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,375
No, no!

18
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,291
Isn't this place supposed to be safe?!

19
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,250
Well,

20
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:41,750
who can say?

21
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,541
-"Who can say?"
-I don't want to die!

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,250
-Just go!
-Move!

23
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,291
I suppose it's time to dice you up.

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,666
Yukimura!

25
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,708
You surprised me, girl.

26
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,708
Do you want to die first that badly?

27
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
It finally appeared! My Spirit Sword!

28
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,500
Master!

29
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,791
If you had something like that,
why didn't you use it?

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,416
I beat him, so what does it matter?

31
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,458
Kuwabara…

32
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,166
Kuwabara!

33
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,708
Someone as idiotic as you…

34
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,541
is fun to fool.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Koenma!

36
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,833
It won't hold for long.

37
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,916
No way.

38
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,125
The hole is widening at an insane speed.

39
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,208
There's clearly some artificial force.

40
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,041
That was close. Your aim's not too bad.

41
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,375
You've finally shown your face.

42
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,125
You scumbag…

43
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,250
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

44
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,208
If you keep widening that hole,
yokai will swarm through.

45
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,541
I suppose so.

46
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,666
If that happens,

47
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,250
you humans won't stand a chance.

48
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you trying to achieve?!

49
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,291
I want to see a larger world.

50
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,208
The world as it should be,

51
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:29,166
before you separated
the Human World and the Demon World.

52
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,333
Not with this small hole.

53
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,000
It has to be a bigger hole.

54
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,041
I want to connect
the Human World and the Demon World.

55
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,583
Don't you want to remove
these boring borders,

56
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,041
and strive for a fairer world?

57
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,833
I won't let you do that!

58
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:54,958
Is that so?

59
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,833
But this barrier…

60
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
I wonder how long it will last.

61
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,166
The fact that
you're showing your face here

62
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,625
means that the barrier
won't hold for long, right?

63
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,166
What will you do?

64
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,375
Do you want to continue
this contest of power?

65
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,875
Hiei!

66
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,041
Sorry.

67
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,208
We got held up.

68
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,833
Kurama…

69
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,833
Thanks.

70
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,666
Don't get me wrong.

71
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,166
I have no intention of helping you.

72
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,708
How about it?

73
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,958
Shall we make a bet?

74
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,625
A bet?

75
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,000
If those boys win, I'll stop the machine.

76
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,375
On the other hand, if Toguro wins,

77
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,250
take down your barrier.

78
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,625
Even if we win,

79
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,125
there's no guarantee you won't make
a machine like this again.

80
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,625
In that case,

81
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,708
how about I bet my life on it?

82
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,750
I've devoted my life
to achieving this dream.

83
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,250
For this,

84
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,833
I am willing to bet my life.

85
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,000
Those words…

86
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:08,833
Don't forget them.

87
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,125
Toguro.

88
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,000
Apologies, but please fight all of them.

89
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,666
Does this mean the plan's changed?

90
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,500
Yes. That's right.

91
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,083
Aye-aye, sir.

92
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,166
Sorry, Yusuke.

93
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,416
The survival of the Human World
is now in your hands.

94
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,750
That's got nothing to do with me.

95
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,166
I'm just gonna
take this guy out and save Keiko.

96
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,083
Come on.

97
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,250
Very nice.

98
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,916
I can't deal with this anymore!

99
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,458
Wha--

100
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,291
Where has she gone?

101
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,416
Is that all the power you have?

102
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,666
I guess I was a fool for expecting more.

103
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,833
There's no point fighting you at 100%.

104
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,291
Shit, we won't make it.

105
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,083
Dammit!

106
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,875
Yusuke!

107
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,791
Stay back!

108
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,833
You bastard!

109
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,833
Hey! You've already got them sorted out?

110
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,750
Poor things.

111
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,750
And over here too?

112
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,541
I expected nothing less
of my younger brother.

113
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,708
It looks like Genkai
died in vain after all!

114
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,916
The master?

115
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,458
What did you just say?

116
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Seriously?

117
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,416
You didn't know?

118
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,666
In that case, let me tell you

119
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,625
in a simple way.

120
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,125
Like a puppet show.

121
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,375
Stop it!

122
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,125
Once upon a time,

123
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,875
there was a young man and a young woman.

124
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,083
The two of them

125
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,333
were friends who wanted to master
the martial arts together.

126
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,125
However, as the years passed,

127
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,708
the woman grew old and ugly,

128
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,208
while the man,
for the sake of martial arts,

129
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,666
became a yokai
with the help of the Demon World,

130
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,416
preserving his youth.

131
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,458
Toguro… used to be human?!

132
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,458
The woman,
after giving her power to her student,

133
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,125
foolishly challenged the man to a fight,

134
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,375
only to be defeated herself.

135
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,041
And that's how Genkai

136
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,666
was killed by my little brother

137
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,791
and went on up to heaven.

138
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,041
What a happy ending!

139
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
You're in my way, Big Brother.

140
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,666
Hey, hey.

141
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,958
What are you doing
to your own flesh and blood?

142
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,250
Didn't you sell your soul as well?

143
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,708
That's beside the point.

144
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,833
I don't remember selling my honor.

145
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,416
You bastard!

146
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,833
Why…

147
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,416
Why did you kill my master?

148
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,916
She was worthless
after entrusting her power to her student.

149
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
However,

150
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,333
it seems she entrusted it
to the wrong person.

151
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,958
She was desperate to let you escape.

152
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,375
I also entrust you with my hope.

153
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,875
Your training is hereby complete.

154
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,250
You may leave this mountain.

155
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,083
Get stronger, Yusuke.

156
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,083
So you can protect everyone.

157
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,250
Incredible.

158
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,125
So that's the power
of the Spirit Wave Orb.

159
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,416
If he keeps at it, he can win.

160
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,416
Unfortunately,

161
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,708
there's no longer any possibility of that.

162
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,250
What?

163
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,416
I take back what I said just now.

164
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,583
You are the first person I can call…

165
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
an "adversary."

166
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,250
Originally,

167
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,125
I had arranged
for Toguro to lose this battle.

168
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,375
To squeeze some money
out of the nouveau riche.

169
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,041
It was fixed?!

170
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,583
Yes.

171
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,791
But that's no longer necessary.

172
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,250
Now that the plan has changed,

173
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,041
the fun can begin.

174
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,500
This is pure strength.

175
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,375
Even the pneumatic pressure from just
the flick of my fingers can be a weapon.

176
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,250
Based on my experience as a former human,

177
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,625
I can see you're lacking something.

178
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,458
A sense of danger.

179
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,541
Could it be

180
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,333
that you still believe
you're not going to die?

181
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,791
It seems like

182
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,791
I may have made a very dangerous bet.

183
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,250
Koenma!

184
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,708
I found it!

185
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:11,291
The event that caused Toguro
to be reincarnated as a yokai!

186
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,666
Fifty years ago,

187
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,208
Toguro's own students
were killed by a yokai named Kairen.

188
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:22,041
This yokai appeared
in order to fight Toguro.

189
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,625
After winning,

190
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,500
it seems that the yokai

191
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,041
ate those students.

192
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,541
What will it take for you
to unlock your full power?

193
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,375
Pain?

194
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,333
Fear of death?

195
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,583
To get that power out of you…

196
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,083
I'll even throw away my honor.

197
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,208
Like this.

198
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,750
I won't miss next time.

199
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,875
So you have rage after all.

200
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,708
But it's still not enough.

201
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,958
Anger alone won't suffice.

202
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,666
Was I not clear?

203
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,750
Stop.

204
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,875
Stop.

205
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,583
I won't miss next time.

206
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,125
Stop!

207
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,666
Stop!

208
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,458
Get out of my way.

209
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,541
Hiei!

210
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:14,125
Kurama!

211
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,541
I still… owe you one.

212
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,333
Kurama!

213
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,916
I won't let you hurt them.

214
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,416
I'll have you die.

215
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,791
To get Urameshi's power out of him.

216
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,458
Isn't it tragic, Urameshi?

217
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,500
You are…

218
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
so powerless.

219
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:31,458
You're… supposed to be stronger than this.

220
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,041
Unforgivable.

221
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,583
Most of all, I can't forgive myself.

222
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,041
Yusuke's Spirit Energy
is coming close to Toguro's power.

223
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:09,416
But can he fight
with his Spirit Energy in such disorder?

224
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,458
I don't know.

225
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:15,083
Right now, underpinning Yusuke's
Spirit Energy is tremendous sadness.

226
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,541
It's incredibly strong,

227
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,916
but severely unreliable.

228
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,083
I'll protect everyone.

229
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,875
That's what I promised Master Genkai.

230
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,291
You don't need friends anymore.

231
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,541
You're just like me.

232
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,000
Throw everything away and grow stronger.

233
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,833
I'm not like you.

234
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,708
I can't throw them away.

235
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,958
I must protect them with my all.

236
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,500
How naive.

237
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,125
How very naive.

238
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,416
In the end, you're nothing more
than Genkai's student.

239
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:20,750
If I kill one more, will you understand?
Or do I need to kill them all?

240
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,666
I finally understand
the weight of what you've thrown away.

241
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,000
It's like our master said.

242
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,416
What you have is not strength.

243
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,916
I won't let you kill anyone else.

244
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,958
That's why I'm going to beat you.

245
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,333
Good look in your eyes.

246
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,208
I'm putting all of my power…

247
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,208
into this one shot.

248
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,166
This will decide it!

249
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,458
Toguro…

250
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,791
You can do it, Yusuke!

251
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,875
Yusuke…

252
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,291
Spirit Gun!

253
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,583
Yusuke!

254
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,625
You have my gratitude, Urameshi.

255
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,291
This is the first time I've used

256
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,666
this much power.

257
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,583
So this is your strength, huh?

258
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,583
Not bad.

259
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,625
He…

260
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,041
He won.

261
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,041
Yukina!

262
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:06,291
I'm glad you're okay.

263
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,333
This was all my fault.

264
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:12,916
I'm so sorry!

265
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,708
I should be the one apologizing.

266
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,541
Humans did these horrible things to you.

267
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:36,791
But…

268
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,250
even among humans,

269
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,833
there are plenty of good guys too.

270
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,041
Don't end up hating all humans.

271
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,416
I…

272
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,375
like you guys.

273
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,125
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

274
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,500
Where does it hurt?

275
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,875
Does it still hurt?

276
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,750
Where does it hurt? Sorry. Don't move.

277
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,750
I don't need this anymore.

278
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,458
Do whatever you want.

279
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,750
I've lost this bet.

280
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,166
The reason

281
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,083
was my failure
to see Toguro's true nature.

282
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,458
I suppose that's it.

283
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:08,458
A tunnel connecting two worlds
to bring hell to all humanity…

284
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,583
I had hoped to see it.

285
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,541
Excuse me.

286
00:40:58,833 --> 00:40:59,958
I…

287
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,708
I'm looking for my long-lost big brother.

288
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,833
Although I've never met him.

289
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:26,958
This…

290
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,625
Does this mean--

291
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:32,958
Don't get the wrong idea.

292
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:36,416
It's not me.

293
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,875
I see.

294
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,625
Then, can I ask who you are?

295
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,000
Just a friend.

296
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,541
To those guys.

297
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:17,541
It's possible this is what Toguro wanted.

298
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,333
To be defeated by somebody truly powerful.

299
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,250
Either way,

300
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,833
for him to choose
the harshest hell of all…

301
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Why?

302
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,375
I guess he wants to punish himself.

303
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,291
What?

304
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:47,541
He said he threw everything away,
but it was actually taken from him.

305
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:53,125
The guilt of being unable to protect them
never faded from his mind.

306
00:42:56,458 --> 00:43:00,708
The path he walked
was not one of redemption, but of torture.

307
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,500
He said he wanted to become stronger,
but he was lying to himself.

308
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,583
What a totally awkward man.

309
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:36,458
I'm surprised you knew
I'd choose this path.

310
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,125
I had a hunch.

311
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,250
Are you really going?

312
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:52,541
Haven't you already atoned enough?

313
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,250
Even after getting revenge,

314
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,291
you continued to hurt yourself
and blame yourself.

315
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,708
Isn't it enough already?

316
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:02,875
You're wrong.

317
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,083
I put it all behind me after that.

318
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:12,250
I was able to focus on getting more power,
so I'm grateful for what happened.

319
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,666
-Liar!
-Genkai.

320
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:17,416
Just leave me be.

321
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,916
Tell Koenma for me.

322
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,833
Yusuke Urameshi…

323
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,041
He's going to get stronger.

324
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,625
But if he's not careful…

325
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:51,750
he'll end up like me.

326
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,625
At the very end,

327
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,958
you're worried
about the person who beat you?

328
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,291
You really are a fool.

329
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,000
Dying won't heal you.

330
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,583
I've caused you nothing but trouble.

331
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,250
Sorry.

332
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,625
For getting you involved.

333
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:07,458
Don't be.

334
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,458
I knew you'd come save me.

335
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,333
Anyway, it wasn't all bad.

336
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,333
I made a friend.

337
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,833
Isn't it amazing?

338
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,125
A yokai friend.

339
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,166
That's true.

340
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,833
You too, right? You also made friends.

341
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,458
Stop talking to her. You'll sully her.

342
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:47,500
You bastard!

343
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,500
What the hell did you say?

344
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,750
Calm down. Ignore him.

345
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,083
Hiei!

346
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:01,416
Thank you.

347
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:05,541
For protecting me.

348
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:15,833
Master!

349
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,000
I kept my promise!

350
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Get away!

351
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,666
Shoo!
