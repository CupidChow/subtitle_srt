00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Episode 4

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is a power that can force the soul to enter the body.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This essence will become the path of the God.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This beautiful soul

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is the greatest mercy for me.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Your Excellency,

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have been trying to defend myself.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Antikonus family's handwriting is very strange.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How can we see such a simple handwriting in our hands?

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's why we came to talk to you.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We may not discover anything new.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We really didn't betray the Golden Glory.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But those stupid high-ranking officials are dead.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The handwriting is in the hands of those professionals.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm telling you,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,040
it's only the master's

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
own fault that you are stupid.

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
No.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
There is one more high-ranking official who is not dead.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
It's him who handed the handwriting to the commissioner.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I must have found out something.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Your Excellency,

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
I will deal with that high-ranking official as soon as possible

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
before you find the secret of the handwriting.

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Please forgive me.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,080
This is your last chance.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Come,

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
I will deal with you.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Klen,

30
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
you are here.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Old Ning,

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
what are we doing today?

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm here to teach you the advanced knowledge of mystery.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,080
The ritual magic.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,080
The most basic practitioners perform almost all rituals and magic

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,080
to seek for power from the outside.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,080
We need to arrange the equipment we need for the ritual.

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Then read the corresponding spell and ask for help.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
I will demonstrate it first.

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
You pay attention to observation and memory.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
The wall of spirituality.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Remember,

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
the ritual magic is the biggest taboo.

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Never try to communicate with the unknown.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Otherwise,

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,120
you can only draw a deep grudge and wait for death.

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,960
My transfer ritual seems to be

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
trying to tell me that there is something strange.

49
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Blood in the blood of the dragon.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Blood in the blood of the snake.

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Blood in the blood of the elephant.

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Blood in the blood of the elephant.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I pray that you can pay me the money for the 30 pounds of bill.

54
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
30 pounds of bill?

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
What the hell?

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Praise the goddess.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
So the bill is solved?

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
How?

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Don't worry.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
The goddess gave the order.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
We just need to wait.

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Look, she's here.

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
You really got the money?

64
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
What a big deal.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I said she would be solved.

66
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
In a reasonable way.

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Look.

68
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
This should be my money.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
What are you going to do next?

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Will the goddess question you

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
for not accepting the money or refusing to return it?

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Sir,

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
your article proves everything.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Please keep the wallet.

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,240
The city should be sincerely grateful.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Please don't refuse the 30 pounds of bill.

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
You are really a kind and generous gentleman.

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
This is the power of magic.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
The power of magic?

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Keren,

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
I saw ignorance in your eyes.

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
I saw a weak and shameless trust.

84
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:25,760
Don't you know the saying of the

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,760
The key to the demon is to digest and play.

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,760
The saying of the demon is a little bit of a play.

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
But it's not a real play.

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
The previous demon has a digestive mechanism.

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Is it because I have played the dandies many times in the battle?

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,280
It's also a play of dandies.

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Sir,

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
are you interested in dandies?

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Dandies club?

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
You can't go back to the place you want to go in a short time.

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
But

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
it's okay to come a long way.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
So

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I can go back to earth in my life.

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Thank you.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
This is the money.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
If I join here,

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I should be able to help me better play the dandies.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you.

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Thank you.

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Thank you.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Thank you.

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Thank you.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Thank you.

110
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Thank you.

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Thank you.

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Thank you.

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Thank you.

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Dandies club.

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
But

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
He is,

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Mr. Jean,

118
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
his ex-wife,

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
A Swordswoman.

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Dandies.

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
All these rumors 1 breathe.

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm sick,

123
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
but

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I have to say something to soothe you.

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
This is the fee for the five bands you need.

126
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Welcome to join the Tingen Group.

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
Thank you, Luo Zai Er, for your great marketing system.

128
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
Mr. Mo Lei Di,

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,920
it seems that you are the excellent record player

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
that Mr. Fansenter mentioned.

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
Mr. Fansenter?

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Our best record player.

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,520
This morning,

134
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,920
he said that an excellent record player would come.

135
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
I think it's you.

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
It's a pity that it's a bit late.

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Mr. Fansenter's record player

138
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
is almost over.

139
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
It seems that today

140
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
we will talk about the magic mirror record.

141
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Magic mirror record?

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
The mirror

143
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,320
is the gate to the world of magic and spirituality.

144
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
If you don't get it right,

145
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
it will turn into a tragedy.

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
May the god of death

147
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
just let me see it.

148
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Very good.

149
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
In the magic of magic mirror record,

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
we usually use three lines of spell

151
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
to symbolize the existence of seven political parties.

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
Not bad.

153
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
The seven political parties' existence is the key.

154
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
It's a safe magic mirror record.

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
It seems that we don't need to inform the captain

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
to copy Mr. Fansenter's

157
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Wazi record player at night.

158
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
The other parts are very healthy.

159
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
But

160
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
there is something wrong.

161
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Thank you, Mr. Fansenter.

162
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,320
It was a miscalculation just now.

163
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Young man,

164
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
what's the matter?

165
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Mr. Fansenter,

166
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm the new record player,

167
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Kren Moridi.

168
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Kren Moridi.

175
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Please sit.

176
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
My record player only dares to tell me

177
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
that there are some hopes in your soul.

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
He only asked you to come here.

179
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Everyone has his own hope.

180
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
But for this hope,

181
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
you are confused.

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
You spent all your energy

183
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
and almost died.

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
You are really an excellent record player.

185
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
You are really something.

186
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Then

187
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
how can I get out of the trouble?

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
The trouble comes from depression and suffering.

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
The record player only dares to remind me of two words.

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Gathering.

191
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Family.

192
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I give it to you for free.

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I hope I can help you get out of the trouble.

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Family.

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Gathering.

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Is it a towering meeting on the ashes?

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Thank you, Mr. Fansenter.

198
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I believe your advice will be of great help.

199
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
The record player's expenses are so low.

200
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
It's almost below our daily living expenses.

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Luckily, it's free this time.

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
The Record

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
As a record player,

204
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
when facing the players,

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
if you succeed in getting the record,

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
you will be rewarded with thanks and rewards.

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
The record will be digested.

208
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
So the core of acting

209
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
is that in the eyes of others,

210
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
you are a real record player who deserves respect.

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
At present,

212
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
the way home is mostly hidden in the ashes.

213
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
If I want to use the ashes to return to the earth,

214
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
there are two ways.

215
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
First,

216
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
digest the record and continue to live.

217
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
See if I can use my extraordinary ability

218
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
to transfer the ashes.

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Then,

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
finding clues to the next drug

221
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
is very important.

222
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
And the improvement of extraordinary ability

223
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
takes a long time.

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Second,

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
change the description of the transfer of the ashes

226
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
to let Zhou Wen point to me.

227
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
If I can connect with the ashes,

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
maybe I can use Zhou Wen

229
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
to borrow the ashes.

230
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
What description should I use?

231
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
The rest of the people of this era

232
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,320
are the mysterious masters of the ashes.

233
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
The one who is lucky to have the position

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
is the king of darkness.

235
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
If it goes well,

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I can even make up for the content of the balloon

237
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
and return to the earth directly.

238
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
The King of Darkness

239
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Mei Lisha

240
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Coming

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
I just made it today.

242
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
If you feel troubled,

243
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
look at it and move it like this.

244
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
It will be much more comfortable.

245
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Simple and regular

246
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
can bring relaxation.

247
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
You made it yourself.

248
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
What a smart little turtle.

249
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
It's a doll.

250
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Are you working again, Kulain?

251
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yes, Mei Lisha.

252
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Since you started working,

253
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
you've been very busy every day.

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I mean,

255
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
you should relax even if you are busy.

256
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
By the way,

257
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
my friend Selena

258
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
invited us to her birthday dinner.

259
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
If you are free on Sunday,

260
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
let's go together.

261
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Birthday dinner?

262
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Join a party with your family?

263
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
The record only reminds me of two words.

264
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Party

265
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
with family.

266
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
OK.

267
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Good afternoon, Mr. Yuzhe.

268
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Good afternoon, Mr. Dao Diao Ren.

269
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Good afternoon, Miss Zheng Yi.

270
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Mr. Dao Diao Ren

271
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
looks like

272
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
a sea of blue water

273
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
that is swimming in the wind.

274
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
And Miss Zheng Yi

275
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
looks like a lake.

276
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
The spiritual world on the relic

277
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
seems to be improving.

278
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Congratulations, Miss Zheng Yi.

279
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Thank you, Mr. Yuzhe.

280
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Thank you, Mr. Dao Diao Ren.

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
You made me an audience.

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Can't they see me?

283
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
The dragon and the storm.

284
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Storms are the path of the water beast.

285
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
It's understandable.

286
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Dragons are the audience.

287
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
The shape behind me is not good.

288
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
It's the shadow of the five-leaf clover.

289
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
It's the twist of the change.

290
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
But there is a lack of a part.

291
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
What does it mean

292
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
to be together?

293
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
You can speak your mind.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Mr. Yuzhe, Mr. Dao Diao Ren.

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I have three questions to ask.

296
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I will pay you back.

297
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
The first question is

298
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
what do you need to pay attention to

299
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
after becoming an audience?

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Let me answer.

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
First,

302
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
the audience is always the audience.

303
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
You must keep

304
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
an absolute and objective attitude.

305
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Calmly and objectively examine them.

306
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
From all kinds of subtle clues,

307
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
grasp their true thoughts.

308
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
To be an audience with absolute loyalty

309
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
is like a role play.

310
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Also,

311
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
you must also control the power of the demon.

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
To find out the symbolic meaning of the name of the demon,

313
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
the greatest degree of the demon is not empty.

314
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
The key to the symbolic meaning of the demon

315
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
is not its name,

316
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
but its audience.

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
It is not the master,

318
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
but the消化.

319
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
It is not the digger,

320
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
but the criminal.

321
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
The name of the demon

322
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
is not just symbolic

323
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
or symbolic.

324
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
It is the key to the消化.

325
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
The white eye of the消化.

326
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
The white eye of the消化.

327
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
The white eye of the消化.

328
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
The key.

329
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Thank you, Mr. Yuzhe.

330
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Your hint is as precious as my life.

331
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Thank you, Mr. Yuzhe.

332
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
You continue.

333
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
My second question is,

334
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
if an animal drinks the demon's medicine,

335
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
what will happen?

336
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Miss Zheng Yi,

337
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
what did you do?

338
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I succeeded.

339
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Record it.

340
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Su Xi.

341
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
In this case,

342
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
the probability of death

343
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
or collapse into a monster

344
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
will be superfluous

345
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,320
if none of these things happen.

346
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
I see.

347
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I have one last question.

348
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Recently, the nobles of the royal family of Luwen

349
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
are looking for reform.

350
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
They think

351
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
those ministers are too stupid

352
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
to be effective.

353
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
So the society is unstable.

354
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
But where can they find so many talents?

355
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
The problem of talents is simple.

356
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
They will hold a fair test

357
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
to face all people.

358
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
They will select the reliable talents

359
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
to serve the kingdom and the people.

360
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Not only the nobles

361
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
but also the common people

362
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
will hold a high-level test.

363
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
It is called

364
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
the college entrance examination.

365
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
College entrance examination?

366
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Mr. Yuzhe,

367
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
you are really a man with rich life experience

368
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
and a wise and outstanding elder.

369
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,320
These are the rewards of the pregnant woman.

370
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Mr. Yuzhe,

371
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,320
what do you want us to do?

372
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:34,720
I have a

373
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
secret diary.

374
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Those Luosai Er secret documents are actually diaries.

375
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
How did he know

376
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
he could see me?

377
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
In addition,

378
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
I need your cooperation.

379
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Please tell me, Mr. Yuzhe.

380
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
During the free time on Sunday,

381
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
try a ritual magic.

382
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
You should know

383
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
the steps of the ritual magic.

384
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
This time, please make a good dream.

385
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
If you succeed,

386
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
you can take a break next time.

387
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
If you are not convenient,

388
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
you will ask for leave in advance.

389
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
This is what we want.

390
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
What about the curse words of the qi ball?

391
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Mr. Yuzhe.

392
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Please give me Nova Luo.

393
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,520
And would you please

394
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Dao

395
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
to try it on her.

396
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
It seems that

397
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
I'll need to

398
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,520
prepare for the periodval

399
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,320
before I go to the soak Waterhouse.

400
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,820
Why don't you

401
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,320
wear the Heavenwaystan map?

402
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,320
We are at the Book of muda Universal Centurystore.

403
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Tao,

404
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,320
the et tanta yardım

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Then, we must use him to

406
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,000
Mr. Yuzhe

407
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe he is the one

408
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,200
who is secretive and scary

409
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,880
Okay, that's all for today

410
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Remember to hold a ceremony on Sunday

411
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Yes, sir

412
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Next, we will wait for the autopsy

413
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,120
Sunday is just the right time

414
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
to deal with the emergency

415
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
I hope I won't disturb the mysterious existence

416
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
deep in the ashes

417
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,960
If you want to play the role

418
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,720
shouldn't you find a chance

419
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
to tell Ban Sen and Meilisha

420
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
that Jiang Chan is the one

421
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Here it is

422
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Meilisha

423
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,120
Happy birthday, Salina

424
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Thank you

425
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,120
I like your dress

426
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
It makes you look very beautiful

427
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Ban Sen and Clarence bought it for me

428
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Here, this is your birthday gift

429
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Hello

430
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Thank you

431
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Come in, I have something to show you

432
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Your two brothers

433
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
are more handsome than I thought

434
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Miss Salina

435
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
You think I look so ugly with Ban Sen

436
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Yulisha Bai

437
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
These two are Meilisha's brothers

438
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Mr. Ban Sen and Mr. Clarence

439
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Hello, Mr. Clarence

440
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Come here, I have something to show you

441
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Young people are very energetic

442
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Meilisha

443
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
There is a friend who is addicted to mysterious

444
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
but is not a good friend

445
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Happy birthday, Clarence

446
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Mr. Dao Diao Ren

447
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Have you started to try magic?

448
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I didn't expect Meilisha's brother

449
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
to be a good fortune teller

450
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Don't worry

451
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Meilisha doesn't know your mysterious identity

452
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
I will keep it a secret for you

453
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Clarence

454
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm sorry

455
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm sorry

456
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm sorry

457
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm sorry

458
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm sorry

459
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm sorry

460
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm sorry

461
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm sorry

462
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm sorry

463
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I'm sorry

464
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm sorry

465
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
I'm sorry

466
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Meilisha

467
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I really hope that you and Ban Sen

468
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
can use the opportunity of the banquet

469
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
to solve the marriage problem

470
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
It means that Yulisha Bai is only 16 years old

471
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Meil

472
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
What are you thinking?

473
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Meilisha

474
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Meilisha

475
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Meilisha

476
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Meilisha

477
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Meilisha

478
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Meilisha

479
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
What a beautiful mirror

480
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
This is a high-class mirror

481
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
that Mr. Fan Sen Teh made for me

482
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Mr. Fan Sen Teh said

483
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
These curse words

484
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
symbolize a higher level of connection

485
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
It will bring more accurate results

486
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Really?

487
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Selena

488
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Let's get started

489
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I believe in you

490
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
I believe in you

491
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I believe in you

492
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
It's not good to be angry

493
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Come on

494
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Kerean Moray

495
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Take your fate

496
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
The magic mirror tells me

497
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
when Meilisha's body will appear

498
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
The second week of the sixth month

499
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Really?

500
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
What about Meilisha's?

501
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm curious

502
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
It's dangerous

503
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
and it's not low-grade

504
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
The magic mirror tells me

505
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
when Meilisha's body will appear

506
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Thirteen years later

507
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
So late

508
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
So late

509
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
The magic mirror tells me

510
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Fortunately

511
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Meilisha and I

512
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
didn't find out the truth

513
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
The magic mirror tells me

514
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
what happened to

515
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
the body of Kerean Moray

516
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
What's wrong?

517
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
How's it going?

518
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Any result?

519
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Oh, no

520
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
It's more urgent than I thought

521
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
It's too late to inform the captain

522
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
There must be other ways

523
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
to save Meilisha

524
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
By the way

525
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
The magic mirror

526
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
was taught by Ni

527
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
It can fight against

528
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
the power of the dark night goddess

529
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
But the magic mirror

530
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Great

531
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
The tools are ready

532
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
The magic mirror

533
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
needs some preparation

534
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
I have to hurry up

535
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Salina

536
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Salina

537
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
What's wrong with you?

538
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Meilisha

539
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
What's wrong with you?

540
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Meilisha

541
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
What's wrong with you?

542
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
I thought

543
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
I was going to die

544
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
hythm box

545
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm sorry

546
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
I have to take care of something

547
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I do not have a matter

548
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
of what to do

549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
I'll be right

550
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:34,720
An protocol done by Evil Bothr and M воция

551
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,600
Let's go

552
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,240
fate

553
00:26:41,920 --> 00:27:00,000
R asked the

554
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,600
Black

555
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,100
That demon's power?

556
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:38,100
Do he

557
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,960
He's inside

558
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
The grace of the master for your death

559
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
And the power of your unworthy non-violence

560
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Tell me

561
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
You are a brave sheep

562
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
In the anti-Genus family's temper

563
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
How did you find it?

564
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Look at your hidden secrets

565
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I will spare their lives

566
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Otherwise

567
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,960
This will be the fate of all of you

568
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Kill them

569
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Kill them

570
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Kill them

571
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
I am the most powerful of the three

572
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I am the most powerful of the three

573
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Beside Aspire and Moussy

574
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,960
The face is the color of the seven demons

575
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
This voice

576
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Is Miss Justice

577
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
She is trying to do magic

578
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
I beg you

579
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Let me have a good dream

580
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
What's going on?

581
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Death

582
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Is the way to follow the master's order

583
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I am coming

584
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
I am the most powerful of the three

585
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I am the most powerful of the three

586
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
I am the most powerful of the three

587
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I beg you to let your loyal master

588
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Take the five

589
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I am the most powerful of the three

590
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I am the most powerful of the three

591
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
I T Mark

592
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,960
Go!

593
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,920
I didn't expect

594
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Those three decrees can really be passed on to me through the return.

595
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Thanks to Miss Zheng Yi's prayer, I was able to find my Ritual.

596
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,520
That's how I was able to use the power of the return to protect myself.

597
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,720
Otherwise...

598
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
No matter if I need to act or not,

599
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,520
I can't tell Mei Li Shan and Ben Sen about the status of the Zhan Bu family.

600
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,920
The risk of the mysterious realm is too great.

601
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,320
I can't put my family in danger.

602
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,920
Gueแล Senior Commander

603
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,720
No, this is impossible.

604
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Hannes Fansenth

605
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
take the grace of the master.

606
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Hannes Fansenth has a problem.

607
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,120
According to Selina,

608
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,720
he gave the Mirror.

609
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,360
And I suspect

610
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,040
Fansenth is related to

611
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,360
the evil group

612
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,440
of the Antigonus family.

613
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,900
Fansenth

614
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,920
SECURITY fact

615
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,540
It's the same as Selina's

616
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,460
forbidden element of the superstition.

617
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,060
Ifети,

618
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,660
jump platform away!

619
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

620
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

621
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

622
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

623
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

624
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

625
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

626
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

627
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

628
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

629
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

630
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

631
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

632
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

633
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

634
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

635
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

636
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

637
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

638
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

639
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

640
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

641
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

642
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

643
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Where are the flames that come in fury?

644
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Where are the keys that cause truth from hell?

645
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Into the dark to dream and scream my name

646
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,920
What do I understand?

647
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Man has already came

648
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,920
With fragile light I've longed to guard a world I've saved

649
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Staring for delight, rebirth or beside

650
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:43,920
With whispers engraved on my shadow, fade away

651
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
I'll sleep a little longer.

652
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Miss, you just got up.

653
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Please prepare for Wang 17.

654
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
Come in.

655
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
These are the clothes and jewelry you picked last night.

656
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Anni, I want to wear the one that Mrs. Jinni designed for my 17th birthday.

657
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
No, Miss.

658
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,920
People will say that the Hu'er family is in a financial crisis.

659
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,920
A dress is actually wearing it for the second time in a formal occasion.

660
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
All right, then.

661
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Just this one.

662
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,920
Amazing, Suoooh!

663
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Outside the closed shop

664
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Who's there?

665
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Everyone is...

666
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,920
I don't know how to explain it. After all, I'm just a dog.
