00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Try your best to get to the memorial hall.

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
That's your only chance.

We made it!

201
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
We finally got out.

202
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,880
A swing of freedom after a long time.

203
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,060
The

204
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,060

210
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,060
The

211
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,060
The

212
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,640
The

213
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
The

214
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,640
The

215
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,640
The

216
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
The

217
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
The

218
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
The

219
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:30,160
Pass

220
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
The police are chasing after him.

221
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
The police are chasing after him.

222
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
What do you need?

223
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
I've got the news.

224
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
It's said that your man was caught in a trap.

225
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Fortunately, the police have stopped the crisis.

226
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Thank God.

227
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,160
So, Klayan is under a lot of pressure this morning.

228
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Klayan is interrogating a police officer.

229
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
He said that he was caught in a trap.

230
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
No wonder that our beautiful girl, Meilisha,

231
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
is willing to buy a bottle of Vsauce.

232
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,160
It seems that she wants to see Klayan relax and be happy.

233
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Klayan, you will...

234
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
uttering

235
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,800
The weather is wonderful but countless Images

236
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,160
After the quickem sesh

237
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
nature promised

238
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
life Scientia

239
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
died away

240
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Dead!

241
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
The hero's soul may be

242
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,160
The wind that blows is the light that never dies.

243
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
It's the crystal that breaks the barrier.

244
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,160
It's the most beautiful song in the world.

245
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,160
I hope the wind that blows will guide you to the depth of the goddess.

246
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I hope the sky will be bright and clear.

247
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I hope you can return to your original innocence.

248
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,160
The only one who returns to the mountain is you.

249
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,160
