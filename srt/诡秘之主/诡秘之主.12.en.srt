1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,940
New York

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,680
Why?

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,640
Why is it like this again?

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,280
Ke yuping,

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
she's engaged last month.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,360
Why did she become a loser?

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Why is it so dangerous?

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,360
I'll use the Goddess's protection to make you safe.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Captain, what did you do?

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Did you want to kill me after you killed me?

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Pity.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
You were sacrificed by 30217.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,360
30217 is a symbol of the human race.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
What am I thinking?

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,360
It's all about the choice of the human race.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,360
But 30217 is also used against the human race.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,360
According to the command of the Klan's snow-draped meeting,

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
the demon girl's sect is likely to have a partnership with the organization.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,360
The case of the human race is related to the destruction of the Golden Thread.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Follow this line and check it carefully.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Understood.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Captain, now that the snow-draped meeting is over,

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,360
can we temporarily end the situation?

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
The snow-draped meeting may be a key element of destruction.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
But the evil organization will never give up.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
The snow-draped meeting is over.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,360
The evil organization will never give up.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,360
The evil organization will never give up.

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
The evil organization will never give up.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,360
The evil organization will never give up.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
The evil organization will never give up.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,360
The evil organization will never give up.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,360
The evil organization will never give up.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,360
The evil organization will never give up.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,820
у

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
How can the evil organization destroy the golden thread?

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Aa plays beautiful.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Land, earth, sky, sky

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
land

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,160
But can not be the war

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
You're back, Ke'ai.

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Are you busy lately?

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
It's your first breakfast. Do you want to eat something?

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Okay. Wait for me to finish my work.

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
I've already remembered.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,160
I hope Mr. Asuka and Ms. Tai Li have a chance to meet.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I don't know what happened.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
I don't know what kind of situation this is.

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Only you can give me the answer.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
It's definitely a death.

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
No reaction.

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
No reaction.

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
This means that the information is not good and the battle is not successful.

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Usually, the information needed to involve in the battle for self-defense is the least.

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,160
If I start from the battle for self-defense,

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,160
the Shenmise will put me in danger.

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm sure the captain's will will put me in danger.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
And the danger is not low.

59
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Be careful.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Mr. Asuka replied.

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
The scene you described reminds me of the vampire and the plague.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,160
The natural vampire was almost eliminated before the stage of the release of the hero of the movie.

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
But I remember that there was a path.

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I want to go to the vampire.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
The flower of the plague.

66
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Some people guess that humans are contaminated or cursed.

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
In a certain situation, it becomes a monster.

68
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Your boss is a hidden plague.

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Of course, these are all my guesses.

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,160
But no matter which one, it proves that your boss is in a very dangerous situation.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Be careful.

72
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Kellei.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Captain.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Kellei.

75
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Go to the second floor of the second floor.

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
The Lundar found the residence of the Lannos.

77
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Do you need help?

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Here you are.

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Nothing good.

80
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
How did you find it?

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
You got clues from the Hudeugner.

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,160
You suspect that the Lannos are related to Ceres.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Ceres and the Horses have a lot of visitors.

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
I checked it.

85
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
An old man saw the Lannos' photos.

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
He said that the visitor number 62 was very similar to him.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
But he has been back for a long time.

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,160
I suspect that there is a secret room here.

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,160
The most hidden room or secret room.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
It's Ceres again.

91
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Congratulations.

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
You finally found this room.

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
It means that you are not too old.

94
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,160
You are qualified to participate in the game of life and death.

95
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Madness will pay the price.

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
The crime of blood poisoning is not forgiven.

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Poor, sick, and lonely.

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
At least 30-year-old workers.

99
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Every factory in this city is full of numerous problems.

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Our game will start with the beauty of the truth.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Silly people, be ready.

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I will take the bomb seriously.

103
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160
The bomb will become stronger with time.

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,160
The bomb has been found.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,160
It's time to go back and tell the captain.

106
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,160
If the game fails, the whole house will turn into ashes.

107
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,160
The Lannos who like to bring the most fun to friends.

108
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I have never heard of the bomb that can become stronger.

109
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
It's a bomb with mysterious meaning.

110
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,160
For example, some people continue the evil ritual of power.

111
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I agree with your guess.

112
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,160
The complaint written by the Lannos is the source of the power of the bomb.

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,160
The problem is where the bomb is.

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
What happened?

115
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Captain.

116
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Captain.

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,160
It was on the stage of the meeting with the world.

118
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Where is the stage?

119
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Under the sky center.

120
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Hello.

121
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
Miss Mei Gaozi.

122
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
She is so sleepy.

123
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,160
She seems to have a problem with her health.

124
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
She said that her child would have a fever if she was in the sun.

125
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Miss Mei Gaozi.

126
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
What are you doing here?

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't know why.

128
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
I suddenly thought of coming to the clinic.

129
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I suddenly thought of coming up to have a look.

130
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Her mental health is deteriorating.

131
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,160
She didn't leave the room last time.

132
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,160
The bomb that the Lannos said is not a bomb.

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
It's the source of the power of Miss Mei Gaozi.

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,160
The industrial revolution that was started by the Chinese army.

136
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:39,920
The era of the Chinese army's

137
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
How many people are there?

138
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I think the bomb didn't get affected.

139
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Miss Mei Gaozi.

140
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Do you have any orders?

141
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I want to talk about Lannos.

142
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,160
She said that you know a lot.

143
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Who is she?

144
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,160
My child.

145
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
My child.

146
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Do you want coffee or black tea?

147
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
A cup of warm water.

148
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Please wait a moment, goddess.

149
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Follow her.

150
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Keren.

152
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,160
I heard that you and Mr. Lannos met for the first time at the party.

153
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Yes.

154
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,160
It's the first time I've seen him.

155
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
It's at the party.

156
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,160
He is very good-looking and handsome.

157
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
He is the most concerned young entrepreneur among girls.

158
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
There were many beautiful girls who were looking forward to dancing with him.

159
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
But I don't know why.

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
He only invited me.

161
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,160
From Huaizi to Kulan Wu, he was with me all night.

162
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Every word of his made me happy.

163
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Every look in his eyes made me look for you.

164
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,160
At that time, I knew that I would never be able to leave him.

165
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Then they told me that he was a liar.

166
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
He lied to me.

167
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Actually, he was not.

168
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
He was very nice to me.

169
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
He often took me to his friend's party.

170
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
He also took me to many wonderful places.

171
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
That day...

172
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
That day...

173
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,160
He gave me a necklace.

174
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,160
He also said that he would give me a surprise.

175
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
At that time,

176
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
a mortal's song was played.

177
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,160
It was a beautiful song.

178
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
My special wish and regret

179
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,160
were to be born into the Hall of the Lord.

180
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Who?

181
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Who was he?

182
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
You said he is pregnant.

183
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
That's right.

184
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I try to turn on the upgrading device.

185
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
But I was too busy.

186
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I couldn't help it.

187
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Also there were nein around the important things

188
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,760
The girl was also punished by him.

189
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,920
And

190
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
we guessed the whereabouts of the letter.

191
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,160
But it was suddenly revealed to us.

192
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,080
The illegal meeting

193
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,120
was too obvious and too valuable.

194
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,640
It was completely hidden.

195
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
It seems that the Black Beast

196
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,640
finally wants to do it in person.

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
But after that,

198
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,200
he disappeared.

199
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,000
He has been in many places for a long time.

200
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,440
I can't find him.

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,400
Don't worry too much.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,520
Miss Rose,

203
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,200
be careful.

204
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,120
His mental state

205
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
has been in a bad state for a long time.

206
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
Fulai and Luo Yao Nan

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,200
haven't come back yet.

208
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,960
Inform all the people who were involved in the war

209
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
to let the police department

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
take them away as soon as possible.

211
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,320
About the man's identity,

212
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
the police department has been in a bad state for a long time.

213
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,240
Captain, Xia Lin,

214
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,200
emergency.

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
All the documents are withdrawn.

216
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,840
It's dangerous here.

217
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,800
Hurry up.

218
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
This is the secret of the Black Beast.

219
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
It must be the sacred creature of the Xu Lei Temple.

220
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,040
It must be a rescue from the Black Beast.

221
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,440
It's a new rescue from the Black Beast.

222
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
The sacred creature of the Xu Lei Temple.

223
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
We can't count on him.

224
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,640
Mr. Asuka.

225
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,280
It seems that Mr. Asuka is still in the parking lot.

226
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,120
His condition is getting worse.

227
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Inform Mr. Asuka.

228
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,920
Mr. Asuka,

229
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,920
I'm not in the same group as you.

230
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,480
The Black Beast who stole the girl's soul

231
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,680
may appear.

232
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,680
The design is really bad.

233
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
It's very dangerous.

234
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
Good.

235
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,840
Department of comprised underground.

236
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,160
He needs your help.

237
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,240
Get two defense equipment temperatures.

238
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,920
I motorcycle 30782.

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
A man needs another 2 cc RouRel,

240
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,400
FL!!

241
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
Meける ねznariye某人

242
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Is the Pickling method still authentic?

244
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,040
Only one or just one of it.

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,440
and the two arrows will be used to shoot the high-level shooters.

246
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
2105, the blood vessel thief

247
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,680
is actually effective against high-level shooters.

248
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,520
It can take away the impact of a target

249
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,120
within a certain range.

250
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,920
But the chance is low.

251
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,560
Then let the blood vessel thief shoot.

252
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,280
Anyone who touches 2105

253
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,840
will be stolen.

254
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,880
Remember,

255
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,600
the limit of the blood vessel is

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
the time of the vessel.

257
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,840
I will tell Nadella

258
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,800
in the next moment.

259
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,120
Shi Yan,

260
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
it's time to cherish your reputation.

261
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Which arrow will you use?

262
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,680
I have another plan.

263
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,640
I will use the core of the seal

264
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
to generate Serena ashes.

265
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,080
This needs to be made into a special skin.

266
00:17:47,280 --> 00:18:06,440
Chief of the

267
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Vehicle Sar 꿀

268
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,020
How is it OK?

269
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,020
Stand by, please.

270
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,600
Grandachts

271
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,640
As much as possible

272
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,440
Exceptional

273
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,680
Where are those chocolatefinches?

274
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,280
No response

275
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
Now all we need is time

276
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,240
I need the third man in my chest

277
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,000
Be logos

278
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,760
Does Aaa

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,640
Don't fawn on them

280
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,880
Run

281
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
You can't leave me.

282
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
What are you hiding?

283
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Mr. Lan Erwusi,

284
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
he actually encountered some difficulties

285
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
and had to leave the front.

286
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Once it's solved,

287
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
he'll come back to you.

288
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
And your child.

289
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Really?

290
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
It must be true.

291
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
He really likes this child.

292
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
For the sake of the child,

293
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
he'll definitely come back.

294
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Mr. Mo Lianzi also said that

295
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
as long as there's a child,

296
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
he'll be able to see Lan Erwusi.

297
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
What a pity, Mo Lianzi.

298
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Right?

299
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Excellent Mr. Zhang Zujia.

300
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Someone told me that

301
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
as long as I come here,

302
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
you can help me give birth to a child faster.

303
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Who?

304
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Who told you that?

305
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
There's a voice.

306
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
There's a voice saying

307
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
that the child is in the South Zone.

308
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
The news of the new goose is very important.

309
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
I'll go up first.

310
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
You stay here.

311
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Captain.

312
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Did you get the phone?

313
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
A message from Baili.

314
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
It's here.

315
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
He asked me to explain it to you.

316
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
In the mysterious world,

317
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,880
there's a law.

318
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
The evil characters won't disappear

319
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
or decrease.

320
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
It's just that from one victim

321
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
to another victim.

322
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Dali and I found out that

323
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
the province let us keep it secret

324
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
and gave us two options.

325
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
After the death of the ghost,

326
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,880
the evil characters will be taken over by the Shangjia Shantang.

327
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
The second is

328
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
the same path,

329
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
seven times the speed.

330
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I don't know their true intention.

331
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
At the same time,

332
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
it will greatly affect the fire extinguisher.

333
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
But we still made this choice.

334
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Stay with them forever.

335
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Captain.

336
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
Captain.

337
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Captain.

338
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Captain.

339
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Captain.

340
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Captain.

341
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
My son.

342
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Go.

343
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Go.

344
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Calm down.

345
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Miss Li Gaosi.

346
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
I miss your son.

347
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
He's alive.

348
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
He should be blessed

349
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
by his father and mother.

350
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
He'll be back in a few days.

351
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
He'll be with you.

352
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
In a few days,

353
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
I'll have a baby.

354
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
I'll have a baby.

355
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
The fire is on.

356
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Go.

357
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
The evil characters

358
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
are so scary and scary.

359
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's go.

360
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
What's going on?

361
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
Go.
