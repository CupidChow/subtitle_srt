1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,540
In Ms.Wang's love,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,280
lets make a special way in

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,220
where the spirit of rinse instagram

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,820
disciple

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040
Rising Fury

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,300
The powerful with high guard

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,580
Can have the power that cites the will of the Gods

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,460
This evolution path becomes

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,140
The path of the gods

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,420
Such You

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,420
и

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Kelei, you're here.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Mr. Ni'er,

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
is there too much problem with the invoice?

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
It's too much.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,600
Only six sheets.

17
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Go.

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
What?

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:57,220
The

20
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:19,220
Kelei,

21
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,620
I have your letter.

22
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
Kelei,

23
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,020
when you saw this letter,

24
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,220
you said that you would come to see me.

25
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,820
I know you are not a good person.

26
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,180
I feel familiar with the

27
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
spiritual instrument you mentioned last time.

28
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
But unfortunately,

29
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,420
I can't remember more.

30
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
So,

31
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,620
I plan to go somewhere else

32
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
to see if I can find more memories.

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
On the other hand,

34
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
there is no one behind the scene.

35
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
If I leave the parking lot,

36
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
maybe I can make the other person relax.

37
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
What should I do in the future?

38
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,620
If the black hand behind the scenes has any action,

39
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,620
I will be the only one.

40
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
This is...

41
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,620
What are you doing?

42
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Captain,

43
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,420
this wanted warrant is...

44
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,620
I didn't explain to you?

45
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,420
I was careless.

46
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,620
This is a big star.

47
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,420
It was empty three years ago.

48
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I fled with the sealed object 008.

49
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,620
I haven't been found yet.

50
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,420
The Holy Hall ordered

51
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,620
not to alert and report immediately.

52
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Otherwise,

53
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620
you will be in trouble.

54
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Otherwise,

55
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,620
you will be punished by 1000%.

56
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,020
The sealed object 008 is...

57
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,820
The top-level sealed object,

58
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,420
the highest level of danger,

59
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,820
the highest level of confidentiality.

60
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
It can't be asked,

61
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
it can't be spread,

62
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
it can't be described,

63
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
it can't be examined.

64
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,220
About 008,

65
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,820
I only know that it looks like

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,420
a common feather brush.

67
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,220
It doesn't need ink to write.

68
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,220
A brush?

69
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,020
After the suspect is killed,

70
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,220
some floating objects

71
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,820
will remain that are too strong.

72
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
If it's not controllable,

73
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,820
it must be sealed.

74
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,820
This is the source of the sealed object.

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,820
What if it's controllable?

76
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,420
You won't want to know the answer.

77
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,820
Whether it's a professional,

78
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
a substitute,

79
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,020
or a mechanical engineer,

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,220
they will face time control

81
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,620
or sacrifice in the mission.

82
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,220
Clan,

83
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
you have to get used to it.

84
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Cheer up.

85
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,420
I understand, Captain.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
You're right.

87
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,620
It's time to cheer up.

88
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,620
And the investigation behind the scenes.

89
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,820
And...

90
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,820
Go home.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Clan.

92
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,020
I bought it.

93
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Ice tea.

94
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,820
You like this, right?

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,420
Thank you, Captain.

96
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
What's wrong?

97
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,020
The things you asked for

98
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
are here today.

99
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,020
22 cards in the Tarot card.

100
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,820
There are pure silver and other metals in the box.

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,220
It's only used to control dead animals.

102
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,820
Why do you suddenly think of

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,620
using the Tarot card as a weapon?

104
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,820
The card is more hidden.

105
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,020
A weapon that doesn't look like a weapon

106
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,820
can only be killed

107
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,820
by a knife.

108
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
You're strong enough.

109
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
You're not as good as before.

110
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Don't worry.

111
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
I'll teach you

112
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,620
martial arts and skills in the future.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,420
If you have any questions,

114
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,220
you can ask me directly.

115
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,220
You're already a serial 8.

116
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,620
You should know more about the spirit world.

117
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,820
I found you a teacher.

118
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
He'll come to you at about ten o'clock tonight.

119
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,220
A serial 6 dead spirit teacher.

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Don't sleep early.

121
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
The End

122
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
You're back, Kellen.

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Did you have dinner?

124
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,420
I've already eaten, Melissa.

125
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,220
What's wrong?

126
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,220
You look better now.

127
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,420
Sorry to make you worry.

128
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,220
Oh, right.

129
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
This.

130
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
I recently transferred to a special position in the police department.

131
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
So...

132
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,220
You're getting better again.

133
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,420
Knowledge is wealth.

134
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
Accounting basic theory.

135
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Bansen, you're...

136
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,620
I don't want to spend five more years

137
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,620
with a low salary.

138
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,020
It looks very hypnotic.

139
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,220
I'll help you with the basic math logic

140
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,020
and related legal knowledge.

141
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,420
Really?

142
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,420
Of course.

143
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Okay, I'll try.

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,820
Learning is the biggest difference between people and hair.

145
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,820
This bronze is the item I wear when I wake up.

146
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,820
It can summon my faith.

147
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,820
Find a relatively safe place and blow it hard.

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
The little guy will come out soon.

149
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Faith?

150
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
No sound.

151
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,620
It's broken.

152
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,820
What the hell?

153
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,220
What the hell?

154
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,220
It's him.

155
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,020
Mr. Haske.

156
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,620
You're a little guy.

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,020
Dali.

158
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,020
Mrs. Dali.

159
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,020
I thought I could scare you.

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,220
That promise to the local council员

161
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,720
just showed up quickly.

162
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,220
Lady, you're just a lowly person.

163
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,620
You're indeed the dead leader.

164
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,940
Lady Dai Li,

165
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,740
congratulations on your promotion to the training room.

166
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,820
I prefer the term, the one who steals the spirit.

167
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,540
Today, I'll teach you two non-reversal skills.

168
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,220
Summon the spirit of the letter.

169
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,460
Use a different kind of magic

170
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,180
to enter the other person's spiritual world

171
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,980
with a kind of magic

172
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,540
to explore the memories hidden in subconscious.

173
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,940
Usually, because people are willful,

174
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,260
they are resistant to the communication between the unprotected spirit and spirit,

175
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,980
so it will be quite difficult

176
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,780
and also has the effect of danger.

177
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,460
In the spirit world,

178
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,460
everything...

179
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,360
Miss,

180
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,980
the relation between you and me

181
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,260
is almost etmekat,

182
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,420
so I'm afraid you might lose.

183
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,620
Miss,

184
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,220
today's knowledge

185
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,620
will it be too much?

186
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,180
Captain!

187
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,740
and fall into the dream again.

188
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,580
Sorry, Daili.

189
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,220
I've disturbed your class.

190
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,220
Remember what you promised me.

191
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
Red wine and a big meal.

192
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,260
Kelan,

193
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,380
put on your weapon.

194
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
There's an emergency.

195
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,060
Ji!

196
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,600
Hode Ogun has always

197
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,340
disguised as an ordinary motel manager.

198
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,620
Recently, he suddenly died.

199
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,020
He accidentally disclosed hiscuity.

200
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,540
He재 glimpse the life of his part-time psychologist Xuleiji.

201
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,940
His dream is chaotic now.

202
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,060
He can't license him anymore.

203
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,860
Try to use the commanding ritual to imitate it.

204
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,900
The doctor's heart is in the middle of the tube.

205
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,740
It has a strong psychological defense mechanism.

206
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,740
Be careful.

207
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,540
Are you asleep?

208
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
No.

209
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,420
I'm waiting for you.

210
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,660
You knew I was coming.

211
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,420
You promised to bring me a cake.

212
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,340
I didn't agree.

213
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,540
Bai Er.

214
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,060
Bai Er said that he would bring me a cake if I didn't sleep at night.

215
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,420
But I didn't.

216
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,580
I didn't bring a cake.

217
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,540
It's you.

218
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,900
You stole my cake.

219
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,580
侵犯!!!

220
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,460
Do you love every single crap?!

221
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,180
I'm bored That really is kicks!

222
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,180
I had my chance!

223
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
The captain's dream power has increased.

224
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
It seems that the drug has been consumed very smoothly these days.

225
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Let's start.

226
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Go.

227
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,900
My qi has made me communicate with the connection of the Wude Dragon.

228
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
You...

229
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Good qi, good zhong.

230
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
What is this sound?

231
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
This is the spiritual sword that the captain said.

232
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
It connects with the real world.

233
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
The past, present and future are here.

234
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Countless information flows here.

235
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,900
This is the entrance to the Wude Dragon and the spiritual world.

236
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Tell me, who are you?

237
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Which organization are you from?

238
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Wude Ogen, Psychological Society.

239
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Psychological Society?

240
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Psychological Society, what is your purpose in Tian Gen?

241
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
No response?

242
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
No response?

243
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Did I ask the wrong question?

244
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Or Ogen doesn't know?

245
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Who is the other one?

246
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
The other one is...

247
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Narhus.

248
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Narhus?

249
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Ogen even remembers his cake when he is crazy.

250
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
They must have a close relationship.

251
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,900
That fraudster is also an extraordinary person.

252
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Fraudster?

253
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Is it the same guyI read in the data?

254
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Being as a prodigy, a fraudster.

255
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Why is Narhus here to see you?

256
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,900
He said you should know that who is behind my back.

257
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,900
The Coalition of Psychological Society is of importance for certain interests.

258
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,900
To provide assistance little by little.

259
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,540
You will not only gain the power of the demon demon

260
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,380
and avoid the method of space and space

261
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,020
but also become the immortal of the dream

262
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,900
The immortal of the evil

263
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,300
As long as we can seize the opportunity

264
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,540
We can also become the master of the world

265
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,460
What does it mean?

266
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,780
The fraud is a special way of speaking

267
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,780
What willipe do you want to do?

268
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,860
Help

269
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,020
I've been helped

270
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,060
I played my part

271
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,940
I made my contribution

272
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,180
Use this

273
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm not afraid of you.

274
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm not afraid of you.

275
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
I'm not afraid of you.

276
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
I'm not afraid of you.

277
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
Damn it!

278
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
The sea of ​​the forest behind me has collapsed.

279
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
The sea of ​​the forest behind me has collapsed.

280
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,180
No wonder it's going to fall out.

281
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Go!

282
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Go!

283
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
Go!

284
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,180
What happened?

285
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
You almost got lost in his spiritual world.

286
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
You almost got lost in his spiritual world.

287
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Captain, I saw a yin sen's altar.

288
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
and a shadow of a real victim.

289
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
and a shadow of a real victim.

290
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
No wonder Ogen lost control.

291
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
Yin Sen's altar

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
is related to the real victim.

293
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
It's likely to be related to the Light Society.

294
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
It's likely to be related to the Light Society.

295
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
And the Psychological Society

296
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
may have hidden behind it.

297
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,180
The Light Society?

298
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Captain, do you remember

299
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
the letter to Mr. Z?

300
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
The letter from the Light Society members to the Psychological Society.

301
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,180
He said in the letter

302
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
that when the time comes

303
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
to destroy the future,

304
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
he will dedicate all the power of the Tingen clan

305
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,180
to the Light Society.

306
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,180
I think it's related

307
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
to the plan of Lan Er Wu Si.

308
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
It may be quite serious.

309
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
We must re-investigate Lan Er Wu Si.

310
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
Lan Er Wu Si

311
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
After Madam Mei Na De

312
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
was angry,

313
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
you shameless bitch...

314
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
You shameless bitch!

315
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,180
She's the murderer.

316
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,180
Why didn't you arrest her?

317
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Madam Xue Lun, Tingen clan's Ming Yuan.

318
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,180
The two of them.

319
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
They are the bodyguards and the new party members.

320
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
They are closely related

321
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
to Madam Xue Lun.

322
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
The one beside her is the current Huo Yi Nan Quan.

323
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
Madam Xue Lun's son.

324
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Son?

325
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
I want to sue her!

326
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
I want to sue you for being the only one!

327
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
This kind of bitch

328
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
deserves to be punished!

329
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Madam Yi Yuan,

330
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
your rude words

331
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
don't fit your identity.

332
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Madam Xue Lun

333
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
was sent by me to see Madam Mei Na De last night.

334
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,180
Do you

335
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
have any objection to me?

336
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Tingen clan's most famous

337
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Jiao Ji Hua.

338
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Let's go upstairs and take a look.

339
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
This is the bodyguards and the new party members

340
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
of Madam Mei Na De.

341
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
This is the bodyguards and the new party members of Madam Mei Na De.

342
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Tingen clan's member and the new party member.

343
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
The initial inspection report

344
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
shows that the time of death was between 9 and 11 last night.

345
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
The body was not moved.

346
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,180
The body was not moved.

347
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Tingen clan discovered it.

348
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Madam Xue Lun was the last person Madam Mei Na De saw

349
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
before she died.

350
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,180
She also eliminated the influence of the superfluous factors

351
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,180
and the death of the first victim.

352
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,180
What did you find?

353
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
It's the same as Fulai.

354
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
But I think

355
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
the death of this member is not that simple.

356
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,180
It must be related to the superfluous factors.

357
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,180
When I investigated the case of Lan Er Wu Si

358
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
and found the clues,

359
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
I found the southern steel factory

360
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
that Lan Er Wu Si was in charge of.

361
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,180
There was a hidden benefit.

362
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
The person who controlled it

363
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
was a highly respected member.

364
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
The candidate for mayor,

365
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
John Mei Na De.

366
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
He is the person I'm going to investigate today.

367
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
The time of death is too coincidental.

368
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Let's investigate Madam Xue Lun

369
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
and see if she is related to Lan Er Wu Si.

370
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
John Mei Na De's death

371
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
has a superfluous influence.

372
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Existence?

373
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Our investigation is indeed disturbed.

374
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Madam Xue Lun is an extraordinary person.

375
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Madam Xue Lun is related to Lan Er Wu Si.

376
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Unable to stop.

377
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
She used a fake name.

378

Can't do anything else to confirm.

382
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,180
How many times have I been disturbed?

383
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,180
Could it be that

384
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Madam Xue Lun

385
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,180

Into the dark to dream and scream my name

ächen

A real flag?

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Mr. Yuzhe,

437
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,500
I have good news to share.

438
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,620
The high-level exam

439
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,900
you mentioned about the choice of talents

440
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
has been approved by the King and Prime Minister.

441
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,580
After all, the official test period

442
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,460
will be held at the beginning of next year.

443
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,700
So soon?

444
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,660
It seems that Miss Zeng Yi's family

445
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
has a lot of political energy.

446
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,420
Very good.

447
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,140
Mr. Yuzhe,

448
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,980
I have something to ask you.

449
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,420
The Qi Guang Hui has been pursuing

450
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,980
the winner of the real creator.

451
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,540
Is it the legendary place of the Qi?

452
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,860
The place of Qi

453
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,860
is related to the real creator?

454
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Why is the land of Luo Si Er

455
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,740
looking for the place of Qi?

456
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,300
This is not what you should know now.

457
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,140
Please forgive my smile.

458
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,420
You guys continue.

459
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,380
Miss Zeng Yi,

460
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,980
I want to ask you for a favor.

461
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,860
What favor?

462
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,500
Find someone's whereabouts

463
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,340
in Beikrand.

464
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,980
Go.

465
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,300
This is a great risk.

466
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,100
But I will pay for it with my life.

467
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,820
Who are you looking for?

468
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,540
The person who is the seven generals of the pirates

469
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,340
will be the last one to die.

470
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,820
The seven generals of the pirates?

471
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,940
Speaking of which,

472
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,060
he also went to Beikrand.

473
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,740
Mr. Yuzhe,

474
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
are you showing your magic?

475
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,780
What language is this?

476
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,660
The origin of the Luo language is Gu Fu Sak?

477
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,580
It doesn't look like it.

478
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,140
It seems to be

479
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,740
Giant language.

480
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,260
It's really Giant language.

481
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,180
Luckily, I learned something.

482
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,140
Where else is Giant language used?

483
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,300
This is an old ancient thing

484
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,540
that has been calculated by thousands of units.

485
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,100
The place of the magic.

486
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
The place of the magic.

487
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,460
You...

488
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,180
You...

489
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,980
Are you a spirit?

490
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,660
I'm not a spirit.

491
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,420
I'm just a person

492
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
who is interested in the history of Manchang.

493
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,420
Yuzhe.

494
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,900
Yuzhe?

495
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,260
Justice?

496
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,860
Alsoики.

497
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,300
Pick a letter

498
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,580
for the weight of the letter.
