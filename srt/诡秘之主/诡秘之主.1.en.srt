1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
cyberspace

2
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,760
dimension

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
doesn't exist

4
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,300
you

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,500
Let's send me to seni

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,360
To meet you

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,760
In any specific case

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Have passed

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,860
Gu 거죠

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,860
I'm not afraid of anything.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
He is not the person that I want.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,580
I have to save him.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,860
If you have to kill him,

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,960
I will do it myself.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,380
YouıkPlain

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,860
What difference does it make?

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,060
Where is this?

31
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
A nightmare?

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,860
The gun!

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
I can't go on like this.

34
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
I'll die.

35
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,860
Come on.

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,260
Who's there?

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,460
Who's there?

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,260
This isn't me.

39
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Klayen.

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,460
I...

41
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
I'm...

42
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,860
What's going on?

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,060
Captain.

44
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,660
Two dead.

45
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,460
Weirqi.

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,460
Naya.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,060
The History Department of Huoyi University graduated.

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,060
Judging from the traces of the scene,

49
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,260
he committed suicide.

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,660
But

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,060
he must have experienced a black war

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,660
or an extraordinary trap here.

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
It caused a kind of

54
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,060
evil power to descend.

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,260
This person is...

56
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Klayen Mordi.

57
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
A dead person's classmate.

58
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,860
His parents are all dead.

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,060
He's currently living with his brother and sister.

60
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
Klayen Mordi.

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,660
The King of Luwen of the Northern Continent.

62
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,660
The Ahuwa family.

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,460
The Tinggen family.

64
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,460
The History Department just graduated.

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,660
They are well-versed in ancient Sakhya and Hermes literature.

66
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
On May 29,

67
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Weirqi found me.

68
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,060
He said he got a ancient notebook.

69
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,860
On June 20,

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,260
we read out the contents of the first page.

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
My Goddess.

72
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,260
This is the notebook of the fourth season.

73
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,460
The author is from a family called...

74
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
The Antigenos family.

75
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,060
June 21,

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
22,

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,860
25.

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,660
Antigenos.

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
The Black Emperor.

80
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,860
The King of Tudu.

81
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,860
The chief of the Hunnaqi clan.

82
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,860
June 26.

83
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,860
Are all these strange things real?

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,860
It's the 28th now.

85
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,260
Why isn't there a date for the 27th?

86
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
The Antigenos.

87
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,860
Everyone will die.

88
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,260
Including me.

89
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Why would Klayen write something like this?

90
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,860
What did he encounter?

91
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Brother.

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
You read all night again?

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,260
What are you doing?

94
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,660
I just woke up.

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Cleaning.

96
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,460
So mysterious.

97
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,060
What's wrong?

98
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,460
This...

99
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,260
seems...

100
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
to be broken again.

101
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,260
Why does it smell like something I can't help but dislike?

102
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Pulling it up?

103
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,260
Shouldn't it be adjusting the time?

104
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,460
It's done.

105
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
What's this?

106
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,860
That's the expression of a weird-looking brother.

107
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,660
The wound is almost healed.

108
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,060
The healing effect of the bandage.

109
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,060
The sun's blood has opened up.

110
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Is it a coincidence?

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
An assassination?

112
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,460
Or a fake assassination?

113
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,860
Although the memory of Klayen's remains is very weak,

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
it lacks a lot of important information.

115
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,060
But it can be confirmed that

116
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,460
it has something to do with that old notebook.

117
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,860
Then...

118
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,260
what about my穿越?

119
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,660
Everything's been normal lately.

120
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,260
It's just that I'm unlucky at work.

121
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,660
Oh, right.

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,860
I made a transfer ceremony for him.

123
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,860
Thank you, Kwww.

124
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
See you.

125
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,260
Klay?

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,760
If you can sleep well,

127
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,460
you can go to sleep.

128
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,260
No.

129
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,660
No type.

130
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,460
All right then.

131
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
I'm going to school.

132
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Remember to buy some bread!

133
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
For 8 B.C.

134
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
Too hot and too hot can bring it bad luck.

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,860
Oh, right!

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,860
I also have meet with meat and peas.

137
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,340
I'll be late today.

138
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Wait for me.

139
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,340
Sorry, Melissa.

140
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,540
I probably won't be able to wait for you to come back.

141
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
The movements of the left wheel are definitely not working.

142
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,340
Melissa, who is just a wall away,

143
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,740
didn't notice anything.

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,740
This place is dangerous for one second.

145
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,260
I should hurry and go.

146
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,660
It's even more dangerous.

147
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
I should hurry and try to transfer the ceremony.

148
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,660
Let's see if I can get through it.

149
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,260
I hope I can eat dinner at home today.

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,220
Mrs. Siling,

151
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,420
eight pounds of black wheat bread.

152
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,460
You're here to pay your respects.

153
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
You've graduated, right?

154
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Thanks for your blessings, Mrs. Siling.

155
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,060
You're really an excellent young man.

156
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,380
I believe you'll be able to earn money soon

157
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,100
and get a new house.

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,900
You shouldn't live in an apartment like this.

159
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,100
At least you should have a relationship of your own.

160
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
Mrs. Siling,

161
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,300
you're really like a young and lively lady today.

162
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,700
Goodbye, Mrs. Siling.

163
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Goodbye, Xia Keren.

164
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
The sun is about to set.

165
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,300
If it wasn't for the red moon being too long,

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,700
would this really be like the parallel world on Earth?

167
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Third.

168
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Ten.

169
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Two.

170
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
One.

171
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Two.

172
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Three.

173
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Four.

174
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Five.

175
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Six.

176
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Seven.

177
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Eight.

178
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Nine.

179
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Ten.

180
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Ten.

181
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Ten.

182
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Ten.

183
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Ten.

184
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Ten.

185
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Ten.

186
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Ten.

187
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
Ten.

188
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Ten.

189
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Ten.

190
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Ten.

191
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Ten.

192
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Ten.

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Ten.

194
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
The Earth Lord?

195
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Yes.

196
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
There's a Earth Lord in this world.

197
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,900
It seems that it was invented by the emperor of Indus,

198
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,900
the ancient Stapho of Rosseil, more than a hundred years ago.

199
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,100
He also invented the Tarot Card,

200
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,500
the Seven-Star,

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,100
and changed the ship.

202
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,500
He also developed the history of the Spring Festival.

203
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,500
According to the book,

204
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
the Great Earth of Rosseil

205
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
is the hometown of the passers-by

206
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,700
and the countrymen of the Great Chihua.

207
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,500
How difficult!

208
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,300
The Great Chihua?

209
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,100
You're close to fromis glass.

210
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,300
If we follow the Star Line,

211
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,700
we can chase it down.

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,700
If we get caught,

213
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,100
we can escape the spot.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
You even went down to the back and killed it.

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
The romantic rain is pouring.

216
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,700
It broke through my body.

217
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Look,

218
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
the trainings will branch in the Kingdom of Heaven.

219
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
Things you just saw now

220
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,260
Ouyang,

221
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,580
come on.

222
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,580
Let's accept your order.

223
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,860
Where is she?

224
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,900
Fate is deep and the track is hard to find.

225
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,900
I can help you

226
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,980
to find the secret.

227
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Tarot cards

228
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,860
are very different from the cards on earth.

229
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,380
The earth is really simple.

230
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,340
You are the first one to ask for help today.

231
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,420
Free of charge.

232
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,260
Please sit down.

233
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,460
Free of charge?

234
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,580
Of course.

235
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,700
Let's start.

236
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,340
Wait.

237
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,140
Let me confirm it.

238
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,340
What about detoxification?

239
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,380
Free of charge too?

240
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,860
Free...

241
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,900
Free...

242
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,980
Free of charge too.

243
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,380
Free of charge is the most expensive.

244
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,940
What do you want to touch?

245
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,660
The past,

246
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,900
the present

247
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,380
and the future.

248
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,300
Then please wash the cards again.

249
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,580
Don't think about what you want to ask.

250
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,620
I've already thought about it.

251
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Please start.

252
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,620
This symbol is the past.

253
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
This symbol is the present.

254
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,420
This symbol is the future.

255
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,380
Okay, Mr. Free.

256
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,820
Which card do you want to see first?

257
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,900
Now.

258
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The last card.

259
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
The last card.

260
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,380
The last card.

261
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,860
The last card.

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,980
The number 0 and 100 of the tower.

263
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,900
It contains all possible keys.

264
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Why are you pretending to me again?

265
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,220
You have to remember.

266
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,500
You are just a trainer.

267
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
This is really...

268
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,820
It's not a good sign to be a trainer of the Zhan Bu family.

269
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,580
Go and take care of your nonsense.

270
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,500
Don't let me catch you again.

271
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,900
Sir, my Zhan Bu family...

272
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Episode 2

273
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,180
It's good to transfer the body.

274
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,500
It's okay to transfer the body.

275
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,860
Please.

276
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,380
Let me go home smoothly.

277
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,420
Put four corners in the four-fifths of the area.

278
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,020
Stand in the center of the room.

279
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,740
Use the four-leaf reverse needle to walk out a square.

280
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
The late Emperor Xuan Huang of Fusheng.

281
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,380
The late Emperor Tian Jun of Fusheng.

282
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,660
The late Emperor Shang Di of Fusheng.

283
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,140
The late Emperor...

284
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
The late Emperor...

285
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,020
No reaction.

286
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,860
It shouldn't be.

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,580
Just now, it was...

288
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,380
How could it be?

289
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,740
Here again.

290
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,700
Where is this place?

291
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,220
Demon Realm...

292
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:22,940
In the name of Team Huo'er,

293
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:07,300
The

294
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:17,860
Roshan

295
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,920
Your Young Master

296
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,020
Could you tell me

297
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,380
where is

298
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,400
Her Highness going?

299
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,500
The Chalan Palace

300
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
But I summoned it.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,500
Are you the owner of this sacred jade?

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Sacred jade?

303
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Even without a temple, it can be called sacred jade?

304
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
The words and actions in the book of books are all the same.

305
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
They are all the same.

306
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Could it be that the soul-gathering is the power that I can use?

307
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
As expected.

308
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Prime Minister He,

309
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
may I ask

310
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
what is this place?

311
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
You said that this place is the place of the soul-gathering.

312
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Where is this place?

313
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Who are you?

314
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I am...

315
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Zhong Ming Rui or Kailan?

316
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
You can call me

317
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Yuzhe.

318
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Yuzhe.

319
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Mr. Yuzhe,

320
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
what do you want to do?

321
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
A common thing.

322
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Common thing?

323
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Mr. Yuzhe,

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
has the common thing ended?

325
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Can we go back?

326
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Of course.

327
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
If you officially propose,

328
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I can let you go back now.

329
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
The voice sounds like a naive girl.

330
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
But the other one is

331
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
calm,

332
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
alert,

333
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
and ignorant.

334
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
This is a wonderful experience.

335
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I have been looking forward to a miracle like a mystery that transcends nature.

336
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Mr. Yuzhe,

337
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
what should I do to become an extraordinary person?

338
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Extraordinary person?

339
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I have never heard of it.

340
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
This question,

341
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
this gentleman

342
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
can give you the perfect answer.

343
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
The woman opposite is a noble family.

344
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
And I am far away in the Sea of ​​Sonia.

345
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
How did Yuzhe do it?

346
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I don't know.

347
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
How did Yuzhe do it?

348
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You are Lu Wen, right?

349
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
If you want to become extraordinary,

350
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
you can join the Black Night Goddess,

351
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
the Lord of Storm,

352
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
or other organizations.

353
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Although most people

354
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
will never see extraordinary,

355
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
extraordinary people do exist.

356
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
They are still fighting against

357
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
the danger of the growth of darkness.

358
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
But I don't want to lose my freedom.

359
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Then you go to the Wang family,

360
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
or find those noble families.

361
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Is there no other way?

362
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I actually have two

363
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
fake medicines with wine in my hand.

364
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Really?

365
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Which two?

366
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
One is called Water Hand,

367
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
the other one is called Guan Zhong.

368
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
You can get the observance of Min Rui.

369
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Sounds like a different type of superpower.

370
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
The wine of the Chess Clan is a level of ability.

371
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
This ashes

372
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
and my穿越

373
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
are also an extraordinary power?

374
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Mr. Yuzhe,

375
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I have made a deal with this gentleman.

376
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Please allow me to ask for a favor.

377
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Can you be our witness?

378
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
A small thing.

379
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Then do you mind

380
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
to have more such gatherings?

381
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Gatherings?

382
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Mr. Yuzhe,

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
you have the power

384
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
that we can't imagine.

385
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
But the noble lady opposite you

386
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
and I

387
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
may help you to do something

388
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
that you can't do in the future.

389
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Regular gatherings

390
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
are easy to reveal my secret.

391
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
But in the mystery field,

392
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
there is more hope to go home.

393
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm afraid that I'll be in the town because of this.

394
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Gatherings?

395
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Every Monday,

396
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
3 p.m.

397
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
try to be alone.

398
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
You continue to be alone.

399
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Then we should

400
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
give ourselves a nickname.

401
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
After all,

402
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
we can't communicate with real life.

403
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Good idea.

404
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Since Mr. Yuzhe comes from Taro Sect,

405
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I've decided.

406
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
My nickname is

407
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
justice.

408
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
You're so arrogant.

409
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm not.

410
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm just a little bit arrogant.

411
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
You're so arrogant.

412
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I don't think I have enough energy.

413
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I heard that

414
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
the one made by Luo Zai'er

415
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
is the most powerful Taro sect.

416
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Yes.

417
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I heard that

418
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Luo Zai'er is the most powerful Taro sect.

419
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm not afraid.

420
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm not afraid of anything that I can't escape.

421
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Enough.

422
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
That's all for today's gathering.

423
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
As you wish.

424
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
As you wish.

425
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Who is it?

426
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Police.

427
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Coming.

428
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
What's going on?

429
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
What's going on?

430
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Sorry.

431
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I was just in the afternoon.

432
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
We meet again.

433
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
You are

434
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
the one who followed me in Shenzhen Square.

435
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Followed?

436
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Interesting.

437
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Why can't it be protected?

438
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Ahuwa Army Police Department.

439
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Lunademichel.

440
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Why are you...

441
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Don't be nervous.

442
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Mr. Muredi.

443
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
We're just doing a regular survey.

444
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Officer.

445
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Are Naya and Willi really

446
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
committing suicide?

447
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
Judging from the traces on the scene,

448
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
yes.

449
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
How can it be called suicide?

450
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
They must be a bandit.

451
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
What a strange thing.

452
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
You...

453
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
And this sentence.

454
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
What does it mean

455
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
that you are Muredi and Ajisa?

456
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I don't know.

457
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I really can't remember.

458
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Especially the recent things.

459
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
There is evidence that it's the 27th.

460
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
You went to Mr. Mardu's desk.

461
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I did.

462
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
You may not believe me.

463
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I can only guess it

464
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
with my diary.

465
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Mr. Maigawen lost a left-hand gun.

466
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I think

467
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
we can find it here.

468
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Right, Mr. Muredi?

469
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
In the stove over there.

470
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Is there anything you want to add?

471
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Yes.

472
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I woke up last night.

473
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I found myself lying on the desk.

474
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
It looked like I had a failed suicide.

475
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I was afraid.

476
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
After that,

477
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
I started to lose some memories.

478
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You have a good heart.

479
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
You should be able to hear my sincerity.

480
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
This is indeed in line with my speculation.

481
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
But

482
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
I believe it's useless.

483
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
You have to confirm it through an expert.

484
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
He

485
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
should be able to help you remember

486
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
the part of the memory loss.

487
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
An expert?

488
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
To get the memories of my earth?

489
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
You are lucky.

490
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
We are happy to see you still alive.

491
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
After all,

492
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
it is normal

493
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
for people to die

494
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
in such a world.

495
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
What's wrong, Mr. Muredi?

496
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
What if they find out I'm a transporter?

497
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Stop!

498
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
You little bastard!

499
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
You keep coming here!

500
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Stop!

501
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Stop him!

502
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Let me go!

503
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I finally caught you.

504
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Let him return what he took from you.

505
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Let me go!

506
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Or I will curse you!

507
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Let me go!

508
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
This is your chance.

509
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
What?

510
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
It's an empty mirror.

511
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
It's not complete.

512
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Go.

513
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Go to the port outside the city.

514
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Okay.

515
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
There is no doctor.

516
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Please stop in front.

517
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Where are you going?

518
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
The place where Wei Erxi died.

519
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
It was a dream.

520
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
When did I fall asleep?

521
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I'll go.

522
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Go.

523
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Let's get to know each other.

524
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Deng En,

525
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
the professional.

526
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
He was

527
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
driving a dream just now.

528
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
He is an extraordinary person.

529
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Mr. Muredi,

530
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
in the night.

531
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
We are stronger than you think.

532
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
We?

533
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Don't worry.

534
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I will give you enough tenderness and tenderness.

535
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Let you let go of yourself a little bit.

536
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Okay.

537
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Don't worry.

538
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I just want you to calm down.

539
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
She likes the body more than the man.

540
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Mom.

541
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
Dad.

542
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Kelen.

543
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
The memory of the surface can be erased.

544
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,500
But the sea of ​​the soul must have its remaining colleagues.

545
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Did she see it?

546
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
No.

547
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
She didn't find it.

548
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
According to her, this is my world of the soul.

549
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
She didn't get through my secret.

550
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Is it because of these ashes?

551
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Kelen.

552
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Tell me.

553
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Tell me.

554
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Where did you take the notes of the Apigros family?

555
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
The notes are gone.

556
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I don't know.

557
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,500
What happened on June 27th at the Weier's house?

558
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Weier's house?

559
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Where?

560
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I don't know.

561
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,500
What were you doing when they died?

562
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
I...

563
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
I...

564
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
I passed.

565
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
There are three points to confirm.

566
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
She shot herself.

567
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
She is still alive.

568
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
As for the part of memory she lost,

569
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
it's the same as the soul of Weier and Naya.

570
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
There are no traces left.

571
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
It affects her power and makes people afraid.

572
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,500
I've never met anything so familiar.

573
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
You have to be careful.

574
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
The whereabouts of the notes of the Apigros family are unknown.

575
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Your danger is not solved.

576
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Then I...

577
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
We are not your nanny.

578
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
We can't protect you forever.

579
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Or you want to marry us and become an extraordinary person.

580
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,420
The place where the

581
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
soul of Weier and Naya is found

582
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
is the place where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

583
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found.

584
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
The place where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

585
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
is the place where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

586
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

587
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

588
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

589
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

590
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

591
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

592
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

593
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
and where the soul of Weier and Naya is found

594
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Burn my broken shelter, no style

595
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:19,500
To be free and missed to hold a cup of life

596
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Where the flames have come in fury

597
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Where the keys have come through from hell

598
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Into the dark to dream and scream my name

599
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:38,500
When darkness may, man is or decay

600
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,500
With fragile light I'm bound to guard a world I stay

601
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:52,500
During our delay, rebirth or be saved

602
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,500
With whispers in great time I shed away

603
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Played away
