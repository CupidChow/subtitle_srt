00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,880
Episode 51

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,980
In the Non-Human World,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,800
through an

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,600
ordinary man up into this world,

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,500
human beings can

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,220
gamer and

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,280
over-comers

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,560
разве

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,560
High-level fighters can have the power to force the gods to come.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,560
This evolution path becomes the path of gods.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
It's Boss Wang.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
You...

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Antiknus family's handwriting.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
The Secret Cultivation Society?

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Antiknus family's handwriting is flowing into the market from him.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
No wonder he's been following Kailan.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
It seems that the Secret Cultivation Society is also looking for the whereabouts of the handwriting.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
They definitely won't let go easily and will send more people.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,560
We must find the handwriting before the Secret Cultivation Society.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Captain, Kailan has the clue of the handwriting.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Thank you.

22
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
It's good that you're used to it.

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
I did come here to deliver the handwriting.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
No wonder Bacchus lost control.

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
He's so close to the handwriting.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,560
An extraordinary person kidnapped a child.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
It can be said that it's a gamble for now.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
But it just happened.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,560
The person who kidnapped the child is the one who's going to be the victim.

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
The person who kidnapped the child is the one who's going to be the victim.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
It's said that it's a gamble.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
But it just happened.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Isn't it too coincidental?

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Captain, we didn't find the handwriting.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
The son of the deceased, Rui'er Bibbo, is also missing.

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
This is the target we're looking for.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Kailan, it's up to you.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Bibbo's location.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
What's going on?

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
The cloth was disturbed by a powerful force.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Let's stop here for today.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
I'll report to the Holy Hall.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
There are other ways.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
The Holy Hall.

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
The coat is nice.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
It's very energetic.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Water-like spirit?

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Water-like spirit can enhance communication and improve the effect of war.

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
You might need it in today's arrest.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I approved a second-level seal.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
It's used to track Bibbo's whereabouts.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Someone has escorted the person to the Holy Hall.

53
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Seal?

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
It's a special kind of illegal item.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Some are too magical.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Some have great destructive power.

57
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
They need to be controlled strictly.

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Seal is used in every place.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,560
The second-level is the only danger.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
The Second-Listening Army

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
onions of the Holy Hall

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
violence of the aura

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
The critical point in the war

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,960
Bolgia, Shuleba, Juemu.

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
And...

66
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
Dai Li, Ximeng,

67
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,800
Shulei, Qitong, Lingzhe.

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Miss Dai Li.

69
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,400
We meet again, Helan.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
This time, it's dangerous.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
With a Zhan Pujia with nearly zero combat power,

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,440
I don't think it's a wise decision.

73
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,880
The court approved 2049.

74
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
The

75
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
Although it's about the Antikonos family's handwriting,

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
it's not as risky as 2049.

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,440
Did they evaluate it?

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,960
The result is that it's very risky.

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
But as you can guess,

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Bibo is really the descendant of the Antikonos family.

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
The only one who can find it quickly

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,800
is 2049, made by their family.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm only responsible for using 2049.

84
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Captain De'en.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's get started.

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
Everyone follows me to do this action.

87
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
You can't stop.

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Otherwise, there will be life danger.

89
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
What the hell?

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Is the seal so strange?

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,640
It's so dangerous.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,680
Why do I hear the sound of the radio?

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,840
Is 2049's risk

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,760
just to make people embarrassed?

95
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
So fearlessness,

96
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
genuine and eccentric.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,360
I can't rely on you for the rest of my life.

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,760
Qu started to hide himself.

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,280
I'm taking him out with me.

100
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,920
I must people

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,960
must get tá jointly to follow.

102
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
It's impossible.

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

104
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,720
Come on.

105
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,280
Let's go see him.

106
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Such a dumb little thing

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
will be in danger?

108
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
I can't move anymore.

109
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Is it going to turn into a car?

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm sure.

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
What's going on?

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm going to get you.

113
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
This little thing seems to like you.

114
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Usually, the closer you get, the easier it is to be caught.

115
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Maybe because Clans have touched the notes,

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
as long as there is a little anti-Genghis family related breath,

117
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
2049 will react.

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Don't worry.

119
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Although 2049 has the characteristics of being alive,

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
it doesn't cause any difficulties

121
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
after being guarded and escaped.

122
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,780
But it's not a

123
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,280
Captain?

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
2049's dangerous external performance

125
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,280
can be controlled by one or two people at a distance of five meters.

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
It causes a moth to change.

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Once controlled,

128
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
as long as it is hit by force, it will be able to escape.

129
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,280
So, the body movement is for easy observation.

130
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
If the whole body is controlled,

131
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
this kind of situation is impossible to happen.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,540
Nemesis

133
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Purple blouse

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,140
2049 was 보시면

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:34,320
the second body includes 150

136
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
I've lived for more than 20 years.

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
This is the first time I've been so stupid.

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
All right.

139
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
You can stop now.

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Get in the car.

141
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,240
Can you let me marry Jingfeng,

142
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
your lover from Banyan's Government?

143
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Bring me the body and twice

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,960
then I will bury you in the fetters.

145
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,960
Tienzi

146
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Tienzi

147
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,240
Two years later

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
It's too late

149
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
All ability is lost

150
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Oh

151
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
Lord Tienzi was here

152
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Little Meatball,

154
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
your gift has arrived.

155
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Let me perform a magic for you.

156
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
It's here.

157
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Li Bo is here.

158
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Is Xiao Mo a good-hearted man

159
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
or a bad-hearted man?

160
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Maybe...

161
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
There's a danger in the warehouse.

162
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
There's a danger in the warehouse.

163
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
There's a danger.

164
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
It's very big.

165
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Here comes the danger.

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
This is the danger.

167
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,740
You would be happy

168
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,820
if you kill Jie Luan who did not commit any crime.

169
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,920
But you touched an offender personally.

170
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,500
How could such a plugs knows

171
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
someone who thinks he can defeat perってる and question his fairness?

172
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,880
Besides,

173
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,040
it .ера a prison.

174
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,920
You have my word

175
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
My heart's on his side.

176
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,040
But,

177
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,740
this is my job.

178
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Don't worry about it.

179
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,420
Take him in.

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,220
This is your chance,

181
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,900
to stop killing.

182
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,740
He's dead?

183
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Stay away from him,

184
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I will not let you go.

185
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I will not let you go.

186
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I will not let you go.

187
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I will not let you go.

188
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I will not let you go.

189
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I will not let you go.

190
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
It's not bright enough.

191
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I can't see it clearly.

192
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
This is not a normal flying saucer.

193
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I am dead.

194
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Wait! I can't find its destination.

195
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Jig Mongle

196
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
It seems that death is not that simple.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
It has been controlled by the B.C.

198
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Our attack is seriously endangered.

199
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
I found it. I need you to control it.

200
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
At least three seconds.

201
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Hold it.

202
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
It's not that easy.

203
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I will not let you go.

204
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I will not let you go.

205
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I will not let you go.

206
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
It's not that simple.

207
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I am dead.

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I need you to control it.

209
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
WP

210
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Hold it.

211
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
B.C.

212
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
B.C.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
Watch it.

214
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
I can still kill it.

215
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Fei'er

216
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Fei'er

217
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Fei'er

218
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
I will kill you.

219
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
I will kill you.

220
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
It's really powerful.

221
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
But it's more powerful than the firework.

222
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
I will kill you.

223
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
I will kill you.

224
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
I will kill you.

225
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
I will kill you.

226
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Tai Rui.

227
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Tai Rui.

228
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
B.C.

229
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Antigonus family's handwriting.

230
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Welcome.

231
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Please be careful.

232
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Don't get close to the second brother.

233
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
I will kill you.

234
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
I will kill you.

235
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Baston's search.

236
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
It's a ghost again.

237
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
At least the training is not complete.

238
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I will kill you.

239
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I will kill you.

240
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Stay away from the second brother.

241
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Watch him.

242
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
He can get away in advance.

243
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
The strategy is so bad.

244
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
He can sense the action track.

245
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
If he attacks, he should do it in advance.

246
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
This works?

247
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
OK.

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Learn from the gun.

249
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
I will kill you.

250
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I will kill you.

251
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I will kill you.

252
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
I will kill you.

253
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
I will kill you.

254
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,600
The evil king has been paralyzed during battle with the Studios.

255
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,060
This is not your fault, Little beginners.

256
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,300
Kh habit!

257
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,680
only as body.

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
You have mankind.

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,440
Scare.

260
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,100
No winds

261
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
No thunders

262
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,080
No people

263
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,240
Questions

264
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,260
refuge

265
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,220
AudEx

266
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,060
WYD

267
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,720
기에

268
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,820
Must

269
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,800
Giving up

270
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,960
F Oczywiście

271
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
The Lord of the Sky,

272
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,760
the God of the Sky,

273
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,480
the God of the Sky,

274
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,200
the God of the Sky,

275
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,960
the God of the Sky.

276
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,640
Luckily, it worked.

277
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,840
Can't we control two people at most in the Four Seasons?

278
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,760
Is it because of the impact of the pen?

279
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
So that little ugly guy has been acting on us.

280
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,760
His real purpose is

281
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,040
to control us all.

282
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,200
If we stay here for one more second,

283
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,960
they'll be in danger if we get caught.

284
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,800
But if we go back,

285
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
Fan Xi Xiu...

286
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,360
Right.

287
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,480
San Bu.

288
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,920
It's safe to return to the real world.

289
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
Safe?

290
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
It worked.

291
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,640
You want to be awakened?

292
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,240
You want to save your colleague?

293
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,880
Actually, I liked you

294
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,160
the first time I saw you.

295
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,040
Let's make a deal.

296
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,840
I'll help you get rid of the control.

297
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,720
Give me the notebook.

298
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,440
What a fantasy.

299
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,880
What kind of training is this?

300
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
Of course.

301
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,360
To show my sincerity,

302
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm willing to add new worries

303
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,680
to this deal.

304
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,360
As a former Zhan Bu Jia,

305
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,840
I'll give you an answer.

306
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,080
For example,

307
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,720
the training of Zhan Bu Jia.

308
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Is it true or false?

309
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,200
A former Zhan Bu Jia

310
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,320
misjudged my current state.

311
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,880
He thinks I interfered with the result.

312
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,160
Don't worry.

313
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,960
I've made others

314
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,320
lose consciousness.

315
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,400
The little secret between us

316
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,360
will not be known by others.

317
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
Alright.

318
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,320
Make your decision.

319
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,400
Believe me.

320
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
You don't have much time.

321
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,000
Listen.

322
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,680
The training of Zhan Bu Jia is over.

323
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm leaving.

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,960
I'll control you.

325
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
What?

326
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
Hey.

327
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,400
Get lost.

328
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
What?

329
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,400
I can't control it.

330
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,120
It's Chicie Anderson.

331
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:43,920
the

332
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,080
daughter

333
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,680
It's verder than my River of Heaven martial arts skill that I lost.

334
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:05,600
This terce tree is much more

335
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
powerful than Pale Kindred.

336
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,320
Go and see how it works.

337
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,640
Yes!

338
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
Go now!

339
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I wanted to save you,

340
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,880
but I found that you even had the advantage of forcing the clown into the 2049 Control Area.

341
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
No need to worry.

342
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,880
There are always some special people in this world who can do things that others can't.

343
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
For example, you.

344
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Or for example, me.

345
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Self-hate?

346
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
I know you must be curious about this notebook.

347
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
But you must go to the Holy Hall first to confirm it before I can show it to you.

348
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Okay.

349
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
I'll go.

350
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Okay.

351
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I'll go.

352
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I'll go.

353
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
I'll go.

354
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
I'll go.

355
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I'll go.

356
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
I'll go.

357
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
I'll go.

358
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
I'll go.

359
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
You can't open it.

360
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Captain, you already said it.

361
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Did I?

362
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Now the matter has been resolved.

363
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
You've shown outstanding performance.

364
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Not only did you stop an extraordinary war,

365
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,880
you also personally tampered with the plan of the Civil Society.

366
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,880
I'll report your credit to the Holy Hall for you to be able to turn the table very soon.

367
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,360
Captain,

368
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,520
there's something I don't understand.

369
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,040
It's so dangerous to absorb the power of the pen.

370
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,720
Why didn't you leave the station first?

371
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
People who are affected by the power of the ancient blood

372
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,640
are often easily made wrong decisions.

373
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,840
Don't think too much.

374
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Killing him

375
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,640
means saving more people.

376
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
Don't worry too much.

377
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,920
Captain,

378
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,040
there's actually one more thing.

379
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,840
I already know

380
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:44,120
what the serial number of the

381
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,680
Little Witch.

382
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,280
When the agent is recovered,

383
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
I'll send him back to Beikrand.

384
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,600
Okay.

385
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
You're Klein, right?

386
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
Your performance today is really shocking.

387
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,200
Only the serial number nine

388
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,200
has killed a member of the 70th

389
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
serial group.

390
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,280
How did you do that?

391
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,680
The time has come.

392
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I can't believe it either.

393
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,200
It must be the Goddess.

394
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,160
She's so cunning.

395
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,480
She's so cunning that I wasn't controlled by 2049.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
Maybe it's because I'm wearing a nose ring.

397
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,200
So she used the illusion to make you a deal.

398
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,680
You grab the opportunity

399
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
and make her be controlled.

400
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,880
Then,

401
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
one shot and you're dead.

402
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,840
How many shots?

403
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,520
I always feel ashamed of my gun skills.

404
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,120
Fortunately, the Goddess is with me.

405
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,120
I have to say

406
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
you're the best

407
00:27:47,760 --> 00:28:01,000
and most outstanding

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
I've ever seen.

409
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,760
What are you thinking about?

410
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
Maybe I'm a little tired.

411
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,080
You've worked hard today.

412
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Have a good rest this afternoon.

413
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,760
When in time,

414
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,120
you can worry about other people.

415
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,640
I know it's you that'll cut your losses

416
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,040
and see if you have some 왔.

417
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,960
The demon's pulse calmed down just now.

418
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,080
Must be stewed up

419
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,960
by some magic on me.

420
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Maybe it's a passive feeling?

421
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,960
We can consider

422
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
our training for Blood Elixir.

423
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,040
As for the ones who hear

424
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
Ponadol's 미�不要,

425
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,600
maybe more people

426
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,360
who study history will have a clear idea of it.

427
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,040
It's time

428
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,220
But the

429
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,760
KNS

430
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,660
Yes, Mr Azkach

431
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,320
Before scenario

432
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,200
We invested in an ancient ep Steinuts dumb

433
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,680
An 이유 parents

434
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,600
to the family of Anti-Gonuss.

435
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,160
It's written on it

436
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
that it's the country of the Yatchi of the Honakis Mountains.

437
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,800
The Yatchi of the Anti-Gonuss family.

438
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
It sounds familiar.

439
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,560
I think I've heard it somewhere.

440
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,480
Alright.

441
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,760
Maybe it's just the origin of the word.

442
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,240
Mr. Azike.

443
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,000
If you remember anything

444
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,520
or you get any other information,

445
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
can you write to me?

446
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,080
No problem.

447
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Then I won't bother you.

448
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,600
I need to solve some work matters.

449
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
Thank you for your gift again.

450
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,600
I should thank you

451
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,920
for your guidance these years.

452
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,720
Kele.

453
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
You're working in a security company

454
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,720
that's looking for antiques.

455
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,000
Yes.

456
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,640
You know

457
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,080
I like to explore history.

458
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,160
It's good to like to explore history.

459
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,920
But it's also easy to touch

460
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,080
some forbidden areas hidden in the dark.

461
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Once you step in,

462
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,000
you'll be caught.

463
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,880
In short,

464
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,600
be careful.

465
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,000
I remember.

466
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,480
Mr. Azike.

467
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,520
Anti-Gonuss

468
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,800
and the King of Yanzhi.

469
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,080
The King of Yanzhi

470
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
The King of Yanzhi

471
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
Where are the flames that come in fury

472
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,080
Where are the keys that come through from hell

473
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,600
Into the dark to dream and scream my name

474
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,960
What do I earn to slay

475
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Man is or decay

476
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,320
In this fragile light I vow to guard a world I stay

477
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,840
During or delay

478
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,720
Rebirth or beside

479
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,240
With whispers in grave I'm a shadow I

480
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,840
fade away
