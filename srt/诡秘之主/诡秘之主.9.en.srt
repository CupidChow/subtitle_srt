Inned

00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,680
Episode 26

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,660
In thekadom.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,040
In the edim...

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,440
Humans bully demons...

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,780
and take all things that eidam.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,300
But they don't엽17 life ulterm.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,840
The addressed of these 22 steps is 121 eidams.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,720
In a second it will be 100 eidams.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,080
If it надо 32 eidams...

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
it will eidams all of its viewers.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
The one who is strong in the high-spirited hunting

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,640
can have the power to fight against the gods.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,640
This evolution path becomes the path of gods.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
This should be enough.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I have to tell the captain tomorrow

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,640
that I hope that Mr.Fouran will never be in our way.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,900
The

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Helan, don't shoot.

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
It's me.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Miss Dali.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I know this visit is too rough.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
But I just received a letter from Deng En.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
It's urgent.

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
I can only go back to the base as soon as possible

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
through this little guy.

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Communicate with you secretly.

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
You really don't need a spiritual sealed room.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,640
If the bedroom is the voice of a woman,

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Of course, I personally don't mind

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
being misunderstood by your brother and sister.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
It's indeed Miss Dali.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Deng En said in the letter

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
that you have submitted the application for the promotion.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,640
He expressed some doubts in the letter.

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
But more is the worry of the store.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
But I know

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
you have summed up the acting.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Acting?

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
What is that?

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Enough.

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
You don't have to hide it from me.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
In such a short time, you completely digested the demon.

44
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
If it's not acting,

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,640
then you are evil.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
What is waiting for you

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
will be the trial of the court.

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I can figure it out.

49
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
I have to thank Goddess Biying.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm glad we can talk about this matter quickly.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
I have used it for nearly two years.

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,640
And you have only been an extraordinary person for two months.

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
It's really not pleasant.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Goddess,

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,640
the senior is aware of the acting, right?

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
The night is rising.

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,640
The dark goddess can track down the history to the third level.

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
For thousands of years,

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,640
the bottom-level professionals didn't know.

60
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I'm not hiding it on purpose.

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
There must be a reason for people to believe it.

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I don't know the reason.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
I only dare to say this name

64
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,640
in front of someone like you.

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
The senior suddenly realized the person who plays the role.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,820
The first time the

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,640
I missed the chance to tell Deng En.

68
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
So, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
I want you to tell Deng En clearly about the acting.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Before the saint comes.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Saint?

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,640
You are a strange person who has been exposed in just two months.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
No, genius.

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
The saint is absolutely important to you.

75
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
No surprise,

76
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,640
they have been on the road to stop the root at night.

77
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,640
It seems that our time is very tight.

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Don't worry, Ms. Dai Ling.

79
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,640
I'm going to tell the captain and everyone else now.

80
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
What?

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
You just...

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
You found a good model?

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
You want to talk about the digestion, right?

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
You know a lot.

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Mr. Ni Er.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
What's wrong?

87
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
What happened?

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Mr. Ni Er.

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
The letter from Lan Yin.

90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
The letter from Klan Yin has been delivered to the blood lily.

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
This...

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
This is the letter from the blood lily.

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
This is the letter from the blood lily.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
This is the letter from the blood lily.

95
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,640
This is the letter from the blood lily.

96
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Blood...

97
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
How is that possible?

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,640
It's only been two months.

99
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Mr. Ni Er.

100
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,640
The name of the blood lily is the key.

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Just like Ms. Dai Li is a real leader.

102
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,640
I've been trying to be a real taster.

103
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,640
And I've come up with a taster's book.

104
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
It's like a person's eyes.

105
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
It's like a person's eyes.

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm the one who's trying to do it.

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
But I'm still hurt.

108
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Yes, that's the core.

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,640
The name of the demon is the one we're really going to become.

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
It includes the rules we have to follow.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,640
From the secret man's eyes to the spiritual pole.

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,640
If only I could meet you 20 years earlier.

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Mr. Ni Er.

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Captain.

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Captain.

116
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
The sword of the goddess.

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
He Lei Si Tai San Xi Ma.

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes.

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
The master of the professional.

120
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,640
And also one of the three red gloves.

121
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Red gloves?

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
The legendary elite?

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
San Xi Ma is the most powerful.

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
The most powerful?

125
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
The most powerful?

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
The most powerful?

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
The most powerful?

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
The most powerful?

129
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
The most powerful?

130
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,640
San Xi Ma has been admitted to the sacred dance goddess.

131
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,640
His power is half the power of the Xu Lei Temple.

132
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I've never heard that he would personally participate in the spiritual examination of Xu Lei Ba.

133
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,640
If it's just an examination, he won't use the sacred sword.

134
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Tell me.

135
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,640
You got it from the power of the secret man Ge Yan and Dai Li.

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Yes.

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Why did you tell me all this?

138
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
We...

139
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
We are partners facing danger together.

140
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,640
I can't think of any reason to hide it.

141
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Have you ever heard of the evil god's flute?

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
No.

143
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Have you ever been tempted by the devil?

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Have you ever hidden the secret of the unspeakable man?

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Keren.

146
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Are you okay, Keren?

147
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Don't worry, everyone.

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Your teammates are very good at controlling the demon.

149
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
The god's spirit doesn't have any隱患.

150
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
It has been thoroughly examined.

151
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Now it can be promoted to be an extraordinary person.

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,640
So Keren wasn't punished for sharing the method of controlling the demon.

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,640
This can only prove that although he has been a professional for less than two months,

154
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,640
he is closer to your companionship than many people.

155
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
That's...

156
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,640
To prevent self-destruction,

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I applied for promotion after two months.

158
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
It's the first time I've seen it.

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
It's a little stronger.

160
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Thank you for your hospitality.

161
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Okay, let's get back to the main topic.

162
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
God, please be the yokai.

163
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Stop fucking around in my sight.

164
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
And stop hearing my voice.

165
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
You can't do anything dangerous in the cultivation world

166
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
but you still can baruke our harem.

167
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,640
But this is easier.

168
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Come on.

169
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Everyone role on the Holy Land.

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Follow my call.

171
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I swear by my name and my spirit.

172
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I swear by my name and my spirit.

173
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I swear by my name and my spirit.

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I, Kelle, from now on,

175
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
will never be a traitor.

176
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
If there is a traitor, I will let you punish me.

177
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
I will let you witness my trial.

178
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I will never forgive you.

179
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Alright.

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Now, it's time to prepare your little pet.

181
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
80ml of spring water.

182
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
5 drops of Mantula.

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Sunflower in the dark.

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
10g of golden bean grass.

185
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
13 drops of poison.

186
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
A complete human face.

187
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
An adult who is like a wolf in the grey mountains.

188
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,900
The

189
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Security.

190
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
You are really...

191
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
A professional cloth-cutting expert.

192
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
A professional cloth-cutting expert.

193
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Congratulations, Kelle and Molle.

194
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
You successfully completed the training.

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Little rascal.

196
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,640
What I'm going to say next, you must remember.

197
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
A word or a personal letter,

198
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,640
maybe it's a malicious content that the same path is deliberately conveyed by a strong person with high blood pressure.

199
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,640
If this path still belongs to a evil being,

200
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
then you need to be more careful.

201
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Once it is contaminated, it is easy to lose control.

202
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
The strong person with high blood pressure who does not take the path?

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,640
It's really obvious after the competition.

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
The body becomes lighter.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
The immune system and strength have increased a lot.

206
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Kelle, you completed the training.

207
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
How do you feel?

208
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm still trying.

209
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
The jewelry in the necklace.

210
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
Left hand.

211
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
The training bar has the ability to predict in advance.

212
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
It seems that the little rascal wants extraordinary abilities that are stronger than I imagined.

213
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Is there anything else?

214
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
What?

215
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Is there a change?

216
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,640
It seems that the ability of the air egg has at least more than 70% of the training.

217
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
What is this?

218
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
What new skills do I not see?

219
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,640
It's amazing that you can use your fingers to have such a power.

220
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
You can wear a tarot card on your body.

221
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I can also use the little boat to fly.

222
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
The power is not useless.

223
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Kelle has been in the training for two months.

224
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I have been working hard for a year and a half.

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I should be fine.

226
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,640
This life is so good.

227
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Mr. Ni Er, are you okay?

228
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,640
It looks like he's not in a good mood, but it's normal.

229
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
What happened just now?

230
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I was trying to find inspiration from the Kui Mi Yuan Geyan.

231
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,640
But I couldn't find the right way.

232
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Mr. Ni Er.

233
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,640
But life always has to have regrets.

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Kelle brought us good luck.

235
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
We should celebrate his life.

236
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Let's have a drink together.

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,640
How about going to my restaurant nearby on Friday?

238
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I'll treat you.

239
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Let me think about what you like to eat.

240
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Honey barbecue.

241
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Fille coffee.

242
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Fried fish with tsao-ko.

243
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Green soup with five grains.

244
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Fried goose liver.

245
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
What do you want to drink?

246
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Ice tea.

247
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
What's that?

248
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
New drinks from the Sillimian Bakery.

249
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
How old are you? You still like sweets.

250
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
It's for children.

251
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,640
You should drink at this time.

252
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Okay, I'll go and prepare.

253
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
See you on Friday.

254
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
It's still that petty old Ni Er.

255
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Then everyone will have a meal together on Friday.

256
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Okay.

257
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Wait.

258
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
The one who was looking for Ni Si Men that day seems to be you.

259
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
It's the Xi family.

260
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
The Xi family is not lucky now.

261
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Ni Er didn't show up for two days for the dinner.

262
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
It's okay.

263
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Let's go and pick her up.

264
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
I know Ni Er for so long.

265
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't know if she can play a good zither.

266
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,640
The sound of the zither sounds a little lonely.

267
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Captain, I think we can have more gatherings in the future.

268
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
You can accompany her more.

269
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
The door is open.

270
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Mr. Ni Er, it's me, Klen.

271
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Klen, why are you here?

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Mr. Ni Er, we haven't seen each other for two days.

273
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
The captain asked us to pick you up to the restaurant.

274
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Well, I...

275
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm not ready yet.

276
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
You don't have to dress up, Mr. Ni Er.

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Come out quickly.

278
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,640
No, I can't today.

279
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Mr. Ni Er.

281
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Go, Klen.

282
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
What's wrong?

283
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
You want to give us a surprise?

284
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
No, it's not a surprise.

285
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Actually, I'm a little uncomfortable.

286
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Let's have dinner tomorrow.

287
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Let's change it to tomorrow.

288
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Uncomfortable?

289
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Are you sick?

290
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Great.

291
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Let's come and see you.

292
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,640
If you're okay, we can have dinner together.

293
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm fine.

294
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm fine.

295
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Let's come and see you.

296
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
If you're okay, we'll go back immediately.

297
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
You're lying.

298
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,640
You're lying.

299
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Mr. Ni Er.

302
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,640
I don't know what to say.

303
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
You don't believe me?

304
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Just look at it at a glance.

305
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,300
I hope it will pass, Englishman.

306
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,140
Okay, you've noticed.

307
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,500
I... I'm a little bit screwed up.

308
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Tomorrow... I'll be fine tomorrow.

309
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,900
You guys go back.

310
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,260
Old woman, come out first.

311
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,700
Let us see.

312
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,460
Maybe we can help you.

313
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,100
Deng'er, you said that I'll leave as soon as I see you.

314
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,620
Yes. Let us see you.

315
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,060
As long as there's nothing...

316
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,660
Deng'er!

317
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,820
I'm willing to hurt you.

318
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,060
I'll always stick to this.

319
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,380
A person won't hurt others.

320
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,860
I only have this small request.

321
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,660
Tomorrow, I'll be fine.

322
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,260
I know that you guys think that I'm petty.

323
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,420
But I've never hurt anyone in my life.

324
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
I only...

325
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,860
I only have to pay for the things that I shouldn't have.

326
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
I swear.

327
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,860
I swear to my life.

328
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Deng'er.

329
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,900
Deng'er.

332
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Deng'er, please go back.

333
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Everything will be back to normal every day.

334
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Old woman.

335
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
You misunderstood.

336
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
We've known each other for 15 years.

337
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
I know that you're not in big trouble.

338
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,900
You're just sick.

339
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
I'm very worried about you.

340
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,940
I'm very worried about you.

341
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
I have to see it with my own eyes.

342
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Then I can be at ease.

343
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,940
You're not here to catch me?

344
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
I'm not.

345
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
I swear to my life.

346
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
Fine.

347
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm fine.

348
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,980
You see.

349
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
I'm really fine.

350
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Right?

351
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Old woman.

352
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,980
What have you been trying to do?

353
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,980
You know it.

354
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,980
It's nothing to tell you.

355
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,020
I'm reviving Charleston.

356
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
I've found a way.

357
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm on the right track.

358
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I couldn't save her 20 years ago.

359
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,020
But now I've used enough knowledge and experience

360
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
to do it all.

361
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
What a pity.

362
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,020
I didn't make it through the eyes of the dead

363
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,060
and the power of Dai Li.

364
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,060
I missed the best opportunity.

365
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
No, I can't give up.

366
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,060
Tang En, you go back.

367
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
How are you going to revive Charleston?

368
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Revive?

369
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,060
I'll prepare a body that won't age for her.

370
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Then I'll summon her soul from the spirit world.

371
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Let the soul and flesh meet again.

372
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Isn't that a great idea?

373
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Yes, very great.

374
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
Old woman.

375
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Of course.

376
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,060
This is the grace of the gods.

377
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,060
She keeps describing it in my ears.

378
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
She is...

379
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
She is...

380
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,100
The God of Thunder!

381
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I'm dead.

382
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,100
You want to put me in a dream?

383
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Tang En.

384
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
You useless thing.

385
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I can see it all in my eyes.

386
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Let me go.

387
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,100
I won't hurt anyone.

388
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Really.

389
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Let me go.

390
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Please.

391
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
Please.

392
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Tang En.

393
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,100
This is...

394
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm dead.

395
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,600
Tang En, are you alive?

396
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I just want to quietly try my last life.

397
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Teng'en, do you still remember that I saved you?

398
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Lu Yao, do you still remember that I helped you save your family's life?

399
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Keren, do you still remember that I taught you every day?

400
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,600
I will enter the mountain. I won't... I won't appear again.

401
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm begging you.

402
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Teng'en, believe me.

403
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I will leave tonight.

404
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,600
There won't be any trouble. Let me go.

405
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm begging you.

406
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I'm begging you.

407
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Teng'en.

408
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Why can't I go?

409
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
You...

410
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
You...

411
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Life is made up of material.

412
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,600
A hundred milliliters of spring water.

413
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Fifty grams of water.

414
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Half a pound of gold.

415
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Five grams of fuel.

416
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Thirty iron mines.

417
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,600
And a large amount of firewood.

418
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,600
I can consider to buy my own.

419
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I will do whatever it takes to bring harm to you.

420
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
I will do whatever it takes to bring harm to you.

421
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
The full moon of the flying red is rising.

422
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,600
It's facing the earth.

423
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
The tired soul stops drifting.

424
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
It's resting in the goddess' country.

425
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
The earth is taking away the quail's nest.

426
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,600
And the soul has already turned into a star in eternity.

427
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,600
The soul is already turning into a star in eternity.

428
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,600
The soul is already turning into a star in eternity.

429
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I hope you can sing a song in the heaven.

430
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,600
I hope you can take away the essence of it and the sweet silence.

431
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I hope you can take away the essence of it and the sweet silence.

432
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I hope you can return to the original purity.

433
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,600
The only way to return is to be with you.

434
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
The only way to return is to be with you.

435
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,600
The only way to return is to be with you.

436
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Tuc tripim영

437
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I guard the candle..

438
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,320
The sad Dance in Death

439
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,900
Episodeומא

440
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,720
emos

441
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Freedom is to hold a cup of life

442
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,200
Where the flames that come make you reek

443
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,600
Where the keys that carve truth from men

444
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,200
Into the dark to dream and scream my name

445
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:01,600
What darkness lay, madness or decay

446
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,600
With fragile light I fell to guard a world I stay

447
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Stirring or delay, rebirth or be saved

448
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:23,600
With whispers in grave I'm a shadow way, fade away

449
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:39,600
