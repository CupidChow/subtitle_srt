1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
I've decided that I'll be edifying all myses by using a

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,480
similar task last time.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Thank you.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,080
giveaway young Dragonillaria Popena manamune

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
With the power of life,

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
this essence will become the path of the gods.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The sun has already set,

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the gods have said,

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and the gods have sent me to the sky.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I am the god of darkness.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I am the god of darkness.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I am the god of darkness.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am the god of darkness.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I am the god of darkness.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am the god of darkness.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the sky, I will be the god of darkness.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will be the god of darkness.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will be the god of darkness.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I am the god of darkness.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Congratulations!

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Congratulations!

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Congratulations!

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Captain, aren't you going to send a messenger?

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The headquarters sent someone to escort the anti-Germans notes to Beggarand.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The messenger has just arrived.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The body has not recovered yet.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It still needs some time.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's already a good thing that it hasn't been infected.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The man who sent the message is too powerful for me.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The data records show that the real creator is a evil being who is the leader of the G-Globe and other secret organizations.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a bit like what you described,

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but there is a big difference.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a pity that Vincent died in a dream.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Otherwise, we could have investigated more.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The God of Darkness

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There is another truth behind the Mu Xu Hao's case.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, captain.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want to capture the situation of my fiance.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The Mu Xu Hao he carried has been back for more than a month.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It hasn't arrived at the port yet.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The whereabouts of Chalice Meyer.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Mu Xu Hao

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is probably the texture of the Warblade.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In fact, after you reported it,

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the professional also received the relevant information.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But we need new clues.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Chalice Meyer

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Tris.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you for saving my husband.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's good that your husband is safe.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Klien.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Meyer.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is Mr. Klien, the texture of the Warblade.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is the one who made the texture of the Warblade.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mr. Meyer.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you suffering from any trouble?

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
After Mu Xu Hao came down,

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I had the same nightmare every night.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He is too real.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I am very scared.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't be nervous, Mr. Meyer.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let me see your dream first.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Chalice Meyer

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why do you want to save that texture of the Warblade?

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It is the last living texture of the Warblade.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I just want to ask it

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
why it would suddenly release such a message.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is completely out of the question.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It is abnormal.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Maybe you saw some details,

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but you ignored it.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They are reminding you of the real source.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is...

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The last living texture of the Warblade.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is completely out of the question.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It is completely out of the question.

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It is completely out of the question.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is the last time I've tried to kill myself.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why is it always following me?

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Could it be the hidden danger of a certain evil god?

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That palace

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
has clues related to my journey?

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I hope Mr. Azkac can find the information soon

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and write me a letter.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I am so angry.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Captain.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How is it?

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The person who sent the Warblade is here.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And all survivors believe in his new identity.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hero

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Chalice

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Chalice

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we can't give a hero who is a worker a punishment.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We need more solid evidence.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will send a letter to the company.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We need the help of the person who sent the warblade and the mechanical heart.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Last War

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Feeling like being praised by the victim and his family.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You must be enjoying it.

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Convince their beloved husband to kill each other.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And wake up from their arms.

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What else is more satisfying than this?

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think I have done my job.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
At the end of the day, you still need to complete a task.

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The original partner has been targeted by the professional.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So you can only complete it alone.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is the reward from your father-in-law.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The formula of the training period.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And

114
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Ni'er

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I need the material for Banseng and Melissa's lifeguards.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Not wine.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't worry, young man.

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Come with me.

119
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The Last War

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Welcome to the underground trading market.

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wow

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's quite a good thing.

123
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Of course.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There are also a lot of extraordinary materials.

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not just a mystery fan here.

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But the official will allow such underground black market to exist.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's not as good as a book.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The legal bearer of the windmills is responsible for the dock.

129
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He's always been playing.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This person is so strong.

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The smell of death.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The smell of death.

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No need to care.

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's a monster.

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's got a lot of inspiration.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He's got a lot of inspiration.

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He can see that I'm a monster.

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm a monster.

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's a monster.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He can see that I'm a monster.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here we are.

144
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is a talisman.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Here we are, old man.

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The spring water of the spirit power is ready.

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Did you bring the money?

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Next time.

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Next time, sure.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This effect maintains the aura.

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
After all, it's not extraordinary.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Can't make a real talisman.

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll buy two half-finished goods and process them.

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Half-finished goods are so expensive.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'd better help him pay off.

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Young people have money to read.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The guest has good eyesight.

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is a secret document of Luo Cai'er.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's said that this secret document has the power of the divine.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It will definitely help you get rid of the disaster.

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Thank you.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No need.

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Believe me.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It won't help you get rid of the disaster.

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want to walk on both sides.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's really Luo Cai'er's secret document.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Is there any shadow of the heart?

168
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No.

169
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Terris.

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is there any shadow of the heart?

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Someone is following us.

172
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:21,580
It's the fairy of the

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Go over there.

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The little mouse.

175
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Stop him.

176
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Captain.

177
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Terris escaped.

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We're one step behind.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Follow me.

180
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We need to use your military supplies.

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So, you found evidence of Terris's plan?

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The informant found it.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And also moved some blood samples.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The official assessment was the person who was the most good at seducing people,

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and the evil spirit inside, and the two of them.

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No wonder the blood would be so bad.

187
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go.

188
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The person who was the most good at seducing people,

189
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and the evil spirit inside,

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and the two of them.

191
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,680
We've got two more

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I have a plan.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's a person who likes to spread the evil spirit.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The person who was the most good at seducing people,

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and the two of them.

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We're here.

197
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is the direction of the battle.

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You stay here.

199
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The assassin's path is more suitable for women.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Mr. Terris is in a bad situation.

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Please cooperate.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Leave the scene as soon as possible.

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Leave.

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't stay here.

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Miss, do you need help?

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No.

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm not feeling well.

209
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm going to see a doctor.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Terris is gone.

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The three major agencies and the police headquarters

213
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
have been searching for days.

214
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The search for the missing person has failed.

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
After this incident,

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the Holy Hall approved my transfer application.

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I've got six points.

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What else is more beautiful than a heart?

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I still go to the club a few times a week.

220
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The drug consumption is quite smooth.

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The Tarot Club,

222
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
since the three-part reputation test was successful,

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I have received a response.

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The attitude of Mr. Terris seems to have changed slightly.

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Unfortunately, I can't use this to mobilize the power of ashes.

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's not easy to go home.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,100
The

228
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
bodyguard work is very successful.

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Banseng and Melissa should like it.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's just that I spent some saliva

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
to make Melissa believe that this thing is not expensive.

232
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
There are still various mysterious Bishoke every day.

233
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The combat training has been added to the fight.

234
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's like a second-rate military training.

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The incident of the incident has not occurred again.

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The case seems to be in peace.

237
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Until...

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Until...

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hi.

240
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The police found that

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the death of the two dead people in the past two weeks was five times more than normal.

242
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Five times?

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So they quickly handed it to us.

244
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The perpetrator and the heart of the machine.

245
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Ah!

246
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ah!

247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Ah!

248
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Ah!

249
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Ah!

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Most of the dead are lower-class workers and wanderers.

251
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Very poor or ill.

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
After all, I have already used up all my energy by force.

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Once sick, it is difficult to avoid death.

254
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Just like Klan's mother.

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
If it wasn't for the suffering of the three brothers,

256
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm afraid that the three brothers of the Mole brothers

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
would also have such an ending.

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Someone took a picture.

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That hand is white and tender.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It seems to belong to a young woman.

261
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is consistent with our investigation results.

262
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Exclude all normal deaths.

263
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In other incidents,

264
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
there was a hand of a young woman.

265
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Even in normal deaths,

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
we can't exclude the possibility of the perpetrator's death.

267
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The perpetrator, Terese.

268
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You mean,

269
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Terese and another woman, the perpetrator, were all involved in the case?

270
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I personally judge that

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
all incidents should be related to the witch.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mrs. Laouis has a serious mental illness.

273
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,860
The

274
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,000
Solstice broke a few months ago.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She has always been thinking about revenge and self-destruction.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
She is extremely poor and wants to die.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
These dead people have common characteristics.

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The sub-civil society has also found out.

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They don't want to talk about it.

280
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Captain,

281
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Klan and I have a guess.

282
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This kid.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In these incidents,

284
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
whether there is a superfluous influence,

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the perpetrator is destined to die in the near future.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But the lives they should have

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
are shortened by humans.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I suspect that these deaths are all

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
life-saving.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The purpose of the other party is to summon evil spirits and demons with life.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Or to conduct a terrible,

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
large-scale incitement.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is the purpose of the simulation cult.

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm glad we have reached a consensus.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is called the meeting of the two protagonists.

296
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The wheels of history are rolling forward.

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Ah, shameless.

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Do you have any expectations of being the protagonist?

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We all have secrets.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
As long as your behavior does not harm the professional,

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you are still my teammate.

302
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Likewise,

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I also hope you treat me like this.

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It does fit all the characteristics of life.

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Find the altar as soon as possible.

306
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Stop the ritual.

307
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

308
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is a dead person's body-along item.

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The death of Meng Yan.

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Say hello.

311
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Do you mean them?

312
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a disturbance.

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It can't show the clear result.

314
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Enough.

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The target chosen by the criminal

316
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
will definitely be far away from the area where the memorial tablet is located.

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is due to its instinct to pursue safety.

318
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So, we can select the area where the death

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
will be born in the next few days.

320
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We can narrow the target to the industrial area in the south

321
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and the western area.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's right here!

323
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's here.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sure.

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you.

326
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,700
Zhao Li,

327
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Mr. Mo Shinehoo to meet using the Lunad Fclock Supply.

328
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
36LAUGH

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,260
Press the alarm button to ring the bell and start the hero mode.

330
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,580
Wake up from the bad dream and open the door for the chief of cavalry thus邊時介人民想跨步生破勺第一點

331
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,540
Assistant Knight, wake up!

332
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,300
Attention!

333
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,320
Lady of the clan!

334
00:22:49,320 --> 00:23:01,080
The Spiritualой opposes the

335
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I

336
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I

337
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Mo Yan

338
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I

339
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
I'm found

340
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Meng Yan is out of control

341
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,080
You stay here

342
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Never get close to that building

343
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,680
In danger of being unresolved

344
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,080
Take the bus

345
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Leonard and Fulai

346
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,680
One training bar

347
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,280
One training foot

348
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,080
Can't handle it

349
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Is the enemy already training seven

350
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Tieshen Fashuo

351
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I'll follow you in a jiffy

352
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
I'm going to the hospital

353
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm going to the hospital

354
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
I'm going to the hospital

355
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm going to the hospital

356
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
I'm going to the hospital

357
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Fulai on the right

358
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Leonard on the left

359
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Pay attention to the target's movement

360
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Target is only a training machine

361
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
The evil force is increasing

362
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Be careful

363
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
That's

364
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
Youjing

365
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I'm going to the hospital

366
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
I'm going to the hospital

367
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
I'm going to the hospital

368
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm going to the hospital

369
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm going to the hospital

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I'm going to the hospital

371
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
I'm going to the hospital

372
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm going to the hospital

373
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm going to the hospital

374
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm going to the hospital

375
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm going to the hospital

376
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm going to the hospital

377
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm going to the hospital

378
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
I'm going to the hospital

379
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm going to the hospital

380
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Blood

381
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
The devil

382
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm going to the hospital

383
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
I'm going to the hospital

384
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm going to the hospital

385
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
I'm going to the hospital

386
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
I'm going to the hospital

387
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
I'm going to the hospital

388
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm going to the hospital

389
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,080
I'm going to the hospital

390
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm going to the hospital

391
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm going to the hospital

392
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
I'm going to the hospital

393
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I'm going to the hospital

394
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
I'm going to the hospital

395
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm going to the hospital

396
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I'm going to the hospital

397
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,080
You will be the first lucky person

398
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Welcome to the

399
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
The witch's curse

400
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
The devil

401
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
The devil

402
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
That is why

403
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
The devil

404
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Goodbye

405
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Goodbye

406
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
You are the most beautiful

407
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
You are the most beautiful

408
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
You are the most beautiful

409
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
I suspect this woman

410
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Is Tress

411
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Tress disguised as a woman

412
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
No

413
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
It's a woman

414
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
That's right

415
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
This can perfectly explain Tress's sudden disappearance

416
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Become a woman

417
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
It is true that the upper level of the witch sect

418
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Are all the characteristics of women

419
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,080
Wait

420
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
That is to say

421
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
There are many female teachers in the high level of the witch sect

422
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Once a male

423
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
The woman who practices this skill first

424
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
This witch sect

425
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Is it a kuihua treasure?

426
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
The witch sect

427
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Is a woman

428
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
That is to say

430
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Is a woman

431
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
That is to say

433
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Is a woman

434
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080

437
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
That is to say

438
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
The witch sect

439
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Is a woman

440
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
The witch sect

441
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
Is a woman

442
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
That is to say

443
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
The witch sect

444
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Is a woman

445
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
That is to say

446
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
The witch sect

447
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
Is a woman

448
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
That is to say

449
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
The witch sect

450
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Is a woman

451
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
That is to say

452
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
The witch sect

453
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Is a woman

454
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
That is to say

455
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Burn my broken shell

456
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
To new style

457
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
To be free

458
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
And to hold a cup of ice

459
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Where the flames that call me fury

460
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
Where the keys that cast you from me

461
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Into the dark to dream and scream

462
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
My name

463
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
What a darkness my

464
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Man is warded

465
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Hey

466
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Where the flames that call me fury

467
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Where the keys that cast you from me

468
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Into the dark to dream and scream

469
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Hey

470
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
With fragile light

471
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
I vow to guard

472
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
A world that's tamed

473
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Stirring more delay

474
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Revert

475
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Thorby's shame

476
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
With whispers

477
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Ingraved by

478
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
My shadowed way

479
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Played away

480
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
Thanks for watching!
