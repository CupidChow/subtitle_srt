1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In the extraordinary world, humans can use their physical and physical forms to master the extraordinary abilities of the extraordinary to complete the life-level of the Pure Land.

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The 22 emergency routes start with the 9th sequence. The lower the sequence, the stronger the extraordinary abilities.

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The stronger the higher sequence, the more power the life-level of the extraordinary can have.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This evolution path is called the Pure Land.

5
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
August 18, Elissa came to the Pure Land to ask for Buddha's blessing.

6
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
She has been haunted by the nightmare since she came back from the Amudha Town.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In her dream, I saw an abandoned castle and a ghost of a knight.

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The ghost of the knight is in the castle.

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Captain, there is a ghost in the castle.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The ghosts that can disturb the dream are extremely powerful.

11
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
For this reason, the captain brought 30782, the convenient solar system.

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
30782 can make the ghost within 15 meters disappear within one minute.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It can also make the non-conformists within the range of 6 hours, who only know how to praise the sun's white wings.

14
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, there are two and a half hours left.

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hurry up and search.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The ghost of the knight is in the castle.

17
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Follow me, the jade.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Up there!

19
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The ghost of the jade!

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The ghost of the jade!

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The ghost of the jade?

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Comizi, break us!

23
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's broken! The wind is so strong!

24
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This ghost is not ordinary.

25
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come out and find out its weakness.

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Captain!

27
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I found it! It's a ghost!

28
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Come out!

29
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come out!

30
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It doesn't hurt.

31
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is...

32
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A ghost?

33
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a ghost!

34
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
One minute left.

35
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Fortunately, I brought 30782, otherwise the result is unpredictable.

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Captain, this ghost is very strange and has a strong obsession.

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This kind of ghost has been around for hundreds of years.

38
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Although the ancient times are long, there are many folk legends, but none of them are related to ghosts.

39
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This ghost may have appeared recently.

40
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Captain!

41
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Judging from the style, it should be a work of the fourth season of the end of the game.

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
More than a thousand years ago?

43
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The fourth season of the end of the game may be the time when the ancient treasure was built.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This may be the first master of the ancient treasure, the legendary mysterious and missing first generation Lamode Nanjue.

45
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This person is familiar.

46
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Isn't this Mr. Azk?

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No way.

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The most respected teacher in Klan is a thousand-year-old monster.

49
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, wait.

50
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's just a little funny.

51
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mr. Azk is much more gentle.

52
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The ghosts here should have been purified.

53
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But based on its characteristics, we still need to stay here for a while to make sure that the matter is resolved completely.

54
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The old rules.

55
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
One person takes 30782 to guard, the others rest and recover.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Two hours of rotation.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll go first, captain.

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You guys rest first.

59
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, we'll stay outside.

60
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Call each other if you need anything.

61
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It feels so warm.

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This thing seems to have a very powerful effect on the soul monster.

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's much more useful than the Anwen spell.

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The information shows that this sacred ash comes from the Yindisi.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It has something to do with the sun path.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It can't trace the source because it's disturbed?

67
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If it's on the ash, will it be less disturbed?

68
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I need to find a more hidden place.

69
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The touch is quite real.

70
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's directly based on my feelings.

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The source of the variable ash.

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Eternal Lies.

73
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The Eternal Lies organization has found the sun path.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The golden liquid is the source of 30782's power.

76
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What is this thing?

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
An extraordinary thing that is of high quality.

78
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a very powerful thing.

79
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a very powerful thing.

80
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a very powerful thing.

81
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a very powerful thing.

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is this?

83
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
An extraordinary material of a high quality.

84
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It hurts! It hurts!

85
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The Eternal Lies

86
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's going on?

87
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The sun path pointed to the sun.

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is it the Eternal Lies?

89
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's the divine spirit.

90
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The divine spirit?

91
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If it wasn't for the ash, I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to stick it.

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If I can't use anything to cover it, who knows what kind of thing I'll see?

93
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This... this is...

94
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The white angel.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The skill of making the sun path.

96
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The sun path.

97
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The secret of the golden liquid.

98
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The formula of the song singer.

99
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The secret of the light.

100
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It can't be just the god.

101
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My goodness.

102
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What is this?

103
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I just hit the boss for one minute.

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Did I get a reward for survival?

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait a minute.

106
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The fourth of the training, the dark one.

107
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the first high-level training formula I have acquired.

108
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
As expected, the golden liquid is the god.

109
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The 30782 is more powerful than anyone else.

110
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll take this opportunity to finish off the god's wool.

111
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's it for today.

112
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I should go back.

113
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
In case the captain and the others find out.

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Fortunately, there is no abnormality.

115
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't just sit and die like this anymore.

116
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't just be a god.

117
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You must remember.

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm so sleepy.

119
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Speaking of which, what is that pure white angel?

120
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The soul of the ancient treasure has been resolved.

121
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The lady who entrusted you to solve the dream should not have any more trouble.

122
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's send the 30782 back to the dark crystal.

123
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You can rest.

124
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank you for your hard work, Clem.

125
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is what I should do.

126
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The letter.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mr. Azk has found the information about the Hona Knights.

128
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Is there a message?

129
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I do want to see the information.

130
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But...

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is the man in the painting related to Mr. Azk?

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Excuse me, Mr. Azk.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mr. Azk is not here.

134
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Amudu Ancient Treasure

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Amudu Ancient Treasure

136
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is that painting real?

137
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Mr. Azk, you were not here just now.

138
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I saw this painting and walked in unconsciously.

139
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've been having strange dreams lately.

140
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I drew this place like this after I woke up.

141
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's really a headache.

142
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Follow me.

143
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Dream?

144
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The ancient study of the Hona Knights.

145
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Thank you, Mr. Azk.

146
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then I'll...

147
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Just look here.

148
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are no longer a student of the University of Hona.

149
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can't take these materials to school.

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Sit down.

151
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You seem a little nervous today.

152
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm too excited.

153
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
After all, I've been looking forward to the information of the Hona Knights for a long time.

154
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is very similar to the palace I saw in the dream tent.

155
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But the inside is more magnificent in the wind.

156
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is also a huge seat that does not belong to humans.

157
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The Hona Knights are very close to the Luwen and Yindisi.

158
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This also proves that a long time ago, there was an ancient kingdom here.

159
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is this the kingdom of the night mentioned in the notes of the Antikhanos family?

160
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,900
According to the

161
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The appearance of the people of this kingdom is no different from that of the people of this country.

162
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But at first they were human.

163
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They believe that death is not the end.

164
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The dead relatives will be forced to commit suicide in the dark night.

165
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They will leave the dead on the edge of the city for three days.

166
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
After that, the changes will end here.

167
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It does not involve the burial.

168
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In these ancient relics,

169
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
All the dust and decorations are preserved.

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There are many traces of life.

171
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But the strange thing is ...

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I happen to see this part.

173
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you.

174
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No tomb, no corpse.

175
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
People disappear in an instant.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Never existed in this world.

177
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And this ancient civilization has a mysterious existence.

178
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They call her the master of the night.

179
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Mother of heaven.

180
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The master of the night?

181
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Is the kingdom of the night and the mother of heaven related to the goddess of the night?

182
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Ke Lan.

183
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't you drink coffee?

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So bitter.

185
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You used to be a good student.

186
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I have a little change in taste recently.

187
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have been studying things related to mystery.

188
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I found that your fate has an uncoordinated fluctuation.

189
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Where is it not coordinated?

190
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Unfortunately,

191
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I have this fluctuation that will bring you danger.

192
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But I can't explain more.

193
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But there is one thing I am sure of.

194
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
A part of your fate that is not coordinated

195
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
pointed to me very vaguely.

196
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Have you seen this ancient treasure recently?

197
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
When you see it, the emotions fluctuate strongly.

198
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Facing me, I have never been nervous.

199
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know some of my secrets.

200
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Don't be nervous.

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I just want to find my past.

202
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Past?

203
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Danding.

204
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Before we set out, we have already found a chance to capture it.

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It will be fine.

206
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Mr. Azike has always been very good to Cleon.

207
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The capture agreement shows that

208
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
if we tell Mr. Azike about the ancient treasure

209
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and hide it in the workplace for him,

210
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
he will come to save me in the future.

211
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
In my dream,

212
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
he is not so cruel.

213
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Mr. Azike, you are really an old man.

214
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is the stable.

215
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There is my favorite white horse.

216
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will go to the stable.

217
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You are also an old horse.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There is my favorite white horse.

219
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My child often plays here.

220
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He likes to drag his sword that is heavier than his.

221
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He says that I am the king's knight.

222
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Sword?

223
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That ghost is his child.

224
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Mr. Azike, what's wrong with you?

225
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What was that?

226
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Mr. Azike's dream.

227
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Are you okay, Mr. Azike?

228
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I am fine.

229
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I am fine.

230
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I am fine.

231
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I am fine.

232
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I am fine.

233
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I am fine.

234
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I am fine.

235
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I am fine.

236
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I am fine.

237
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What a bad luck!

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I am in a bad mood.

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This is like a ritual to block the moon.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I am in a bad mood.

241
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I am in a bad mood.

242
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Mr. Azike.

243
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have already cleared it.

244
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Why are there so many souls?

245
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is...

246
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Something!

247
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Something is coming!

248
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Hey!

249
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,400
Mr. H nervousness

250
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,560
Cuckoo

251
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Back from the Houma3,

252
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,200
I've beaten your family with pain and suffering

253
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Shoot me!

254
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,360
Kill him!

255
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:26,000
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH A
