00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Episode 20

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the world of Invincible

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Human beings can use their physical and physical appearance

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to control different Invincible abilities

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to complete the life-level progress.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This 22-step path of progress

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
starts with the 9th sequence.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The lower the sequence number,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the stronger the Invincible ability.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The stronger the sequence number,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the more powerful the Invincible ability is.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This progress is

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the path of God.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The World of Invincible

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Episode 21

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you want to ask?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please leave.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll tell you as long as I know.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mr. Azike,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
about the changes in the balance of my fate,

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
can you still see anything?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the past two or three months,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
have you often encountered coincidences?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Coincidence?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe the clue is hidden in it.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For example, the one you came to me before

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and mentioned.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Antikamous's handwriting.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Antikamous's handwriting.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's my turn.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Invincible Ability

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Good morning, Mr. Neel.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Kelen.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good morning, Ke Wen Li.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What day is it today

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that I don't know?

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I got engaged yesterday.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
it's a big wedding that deserves celebration.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Engaged?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Congratulations, Ke Wen Li.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not easy.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The professional team

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
finally got rid of the curse of being single.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Get rid of the curse?

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Good idea.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have to write it down.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're writing a novel again.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Xi Jia,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
what's the theme this time?

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A thousand years of blood curse.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The demon loves the beauty of the night.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The beautiful and beautiful love.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good guy, don't be so formal.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I need you to read my documents, Ms. Xi Jia.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The morning of work

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
brings joy and pleasure.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But I always have a poem in my heart.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then you should read it.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not reading it.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But you can't write poems.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
On days like this,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
we should take a break

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and have a dinner downstairs.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Today's patrol arrangement.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ke Wen Li, Xi Jia, Xi Xu and Ji Wu go together.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lun Na De, Luo Yao, Liu Shou and Hei Jing Ji.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Fu Lai and I will go to Jialanfei and Mu Yuan.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Understood.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Captain, what about me?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, captain.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can forget about the arrangement.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have no choice.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't forget about the dream.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't forget about the dream.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't forget about the dream.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have no choice.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Dream is a unique style.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Reality and dream are intertwined.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's often difficult to distinguish.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If the captain remembers everything that day,

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
we need to be more careful.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You go to the mansion later.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Keep an eye on the door.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just me?

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't be nervous.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's usually okay.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But remember,

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
no matter what you hear,

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
don't open the door.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Unless it's opened from the inside.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You will be more nervous.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Besides,

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you have been a professional for almost two months.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You need to give a digital report to the court to evaluate.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
At least ten thousand words.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ten thousand words?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Digital report?

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So many.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have to go now.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ailio is kidnapped.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Rui'er's pen is out of control.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Fansen is in a dark place.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Dewey is in the library.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's Chang Ni's door.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The door is locked.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The door is locked.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The door is locked.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The door is locked.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The door is locked.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The door is locked.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The door is locked.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The door is locked.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The door is locked.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The door is locked.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The door is locked.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The door is locked.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The door is locked.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The door is locked.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The door was locked for so many times.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to try again.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The door is locked.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey,

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
pull thebell out of my ass!

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you need help?

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You see?

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You see?

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ceremonial yoke.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Allez,

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I see.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'veнения every day every morning a palamESS.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,320
What's the delay?

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
We could have waited for a while,

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,920
as of now there isn't significant damage.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,400
That's why it's bad ongoing.

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,680
The exercise of a warden

140
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
is fleecing according to wills.

141
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
This place,

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,160
is called遭遇,

143
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,280
it is open!

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
1.

145
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,120
2.

146
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,500
3.

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,120
1, 2,atin the same thing.

148
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,920
2,tries tosk with Soul.

149
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,520
Go to the second floor while coming back.

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,320
3.

151
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,760
2.

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
It's okay.

153
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
It's dangerous to do magic in the first time.

154
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
There's nothing wrong after the poison.

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
There's no problem, Klan.

156
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
You're still a reliable companion.

157
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
You doubt me?

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
It's normal to deal with the process, Klan.

159
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
According to your description, it's really a bad luck.

160
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
But for decades,

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,760
he has never shown any living characteristics.

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Suddenly come back alive,

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and can lure the guards in the door,

164
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
and escape from the seal for a short time.

165
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
There's only one possibility.

166
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
It's affected by other new seal.

167
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Recently, there's only one new seal at Chani's door.

168
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Although he stayed for a few nights.

169
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
You mean,

170
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
the handwriting of Han Tiege's family?

171
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,720
The

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Mr. Yuzhe can read those

173
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Luo Sier secret text like the painting?

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I'm so reckless and stupid.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I even want to observe Mr. Yuzhe.

176
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Luckily, he's not angry.

177
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
On July 14th,

178
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
I met the mysterious Mr. Chalatu again.

179
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Chalatu's painting?

180
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
The second-class Chalatu's family's back.

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
He's actually the leader of the ancient organization's secret training.

182
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Mr. Chalatu told me that

183
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
his series of wine is from the Zhanbi family.

184
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
At the first stage of the series,

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
he strictly plays the role of the time to digest the poison.

186
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
He took out a dangerous seal.

187
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
It's the seal of the Antikamu family.

188
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
The specific situation of the seal,

189
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
he's not laughing.

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
He's not laughing at all.

191
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
When I become the leader of the high-level training,

192
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
I'll beat one of the Zhanbi family.

193
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Big brother,

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
take it easy.

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm very satisfied with

196
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
the Luo Sier diary we collected this time.

197
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
It's our honor.

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Next, you can freely communicate.

199
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Mr. Yuzhe,

200
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
in accordance with your guidance,

201
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I've been feeling the big digestion of the drug.

202
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
I want to ask,

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
when can I completely digest the drug in the coffin?

204
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Good question, Miss Zhengyi.

205
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
I just saw the answer.

206
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
In the low-level training,

207
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
as long as you play it strictly,

208
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
as long as you play it,

209
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
as short as you play it, you'll be a month.

210
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Thank you for your explanation, Mr. Yuzhe.

211
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I have no problem.

212
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Recently,

213
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,760
I heard some rumors.

214
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
A Xule Ba Qing listener of the Light Society

215
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
is looking for the real creator.

216
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
The real creator?

217
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Many secret organizations

218
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
think that the creator is not dead.

219
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760
The core of his remains

220
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
is the real creator.

221
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
It is said that

222
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
the name of the big fish

223
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
is the image of the real creator.

224
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Is that okay?

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Mr. Yuzhe.

226
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I'd rather call him

227
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
the creator of the fall.

228
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Fall?

229
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
You're really a great man, Mr. Yuzhe.

230
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
You're so good at

231
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
evaluating the existence of the real creator.

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Yuzhe.

233
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Yuzhe.

234
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
The real creator,

235
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
no, the creator of the fall,

236
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
is indeed far higher than the normal one.

237
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Is there any way

238
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
to pay for the fall?

239
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
More Rosal's diary

240
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
or

241
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
any information about the Antigone family.

242
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Antigone family

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
I know a lot about.

244
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
But they have a

245
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
strange and terrible path.

246
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
The family history

247
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
can be traced to the third season,

248
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
the disaster season.

249
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
In the fourth season, the god season,

250
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
the family and the Amo, the Yabra Khan

251
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
will build the Tudor Empire

252
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
in the fourth season.

253
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
The fourth season will be

254
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
destroyed by the dark night.

255
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Very good.

256
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
That's all for today.

257
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Obey your will.

258
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
The Antigone family

259
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
was destroyed by the dark night goddess.

260
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Strange and terrible.

261
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
What is the path?

262
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
The Chalatu led by the Cultivation Society

263
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
took the Antigone family's relic.

264
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
The Cultivation Society

265
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
has the path of the Dwarf Clan.

266
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Can I get the following

267
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
formula from the Cultivation Society?

268
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Is it a note?

269
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Calm down.

270
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I have to solve it one by one.

271
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
First,

272
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Mr. Azkir mentioned

273
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
the fate of the note.

274
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
The trace of the Antigone family

275
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
was found in the opposite room.

276
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
The power of the note

277
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
was digested by the Chalatu

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
before it escaped from the root.

279
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
2049 easily traced it.

280
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Fanzent led to Selena's

281
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
black inked stamp.

282
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
I found it.

283
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
But the previous stamp

284
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
didn't find any problem.

285
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
What did it do in the real world?

286
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
The trace of the Antigone family

287
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
was found in the opposite room.

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
It did.

289
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Who is behind all this?

290
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
What is the purpose?

291
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
The Antigone family's note?

292
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:27,840
The

293
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
What does it mean?

294
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,760
The real reason

295
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
why the Chalatu

296
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
was digested by the Antigone family

297
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
is the real reason

298
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
why Fanzent led to

299
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
the Chalatu.

300
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
It's the same as the previous

301
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
stamp.

302
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
There is no clearer result.

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Iron stone,

304
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
water star, black ink.

305
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
It's not that big.

306
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
It can't be decoded.

307
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Or because the spirit

308
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
is not enough,

309
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
the result is not clear.

310
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
The study should be updated.

311
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
But the ink

312
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
is too big.

313
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
It's not a problem.

314
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
The Chalatu

315
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
led to the Antigone family's

316
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
trace.

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
It kept the Antigone family

318
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
from being arrogant and self-righteous.

319
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I've always done that.

320
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
The Chalatu still stopped.

321
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
The real Chalatu

322
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
is not only the white ink.

323
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
It became the real impgence

324
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,100
of the Antigone family who

325
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
often紀是的 the Nag Mi.

326
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Wu Yiku!

327
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
It's moving!

328
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Obtain more ink!

329
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Movit yourself!

330
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
It's moving!

331
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
The Antigone Family'sventilation

332
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,260
is in progress on the Antigone flunus.

333
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,460
Only 2 minutes left.

334
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,660
Don't

335
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
The body.

336
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,260
I want to combine with Fanzent.

337
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,860
It's the handwriting.

338
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,460
Use the handwriting to appear in the Demon's Secret Cultivation.

339
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
And get the little ugly formula.

340
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,460
But that thing like a brain flower.

341
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,060
What does the blood ball mean?

342
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,860
And who is this person?

343
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,860
The body.

344
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,060
Miss Christina, I'm really sorry.

345
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Mr. Mollady is not in the club.

346
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Mr. Mollady, why are you here?

347
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,860
Good morning.

348
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,860
Honakis.

349
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,660
How great is it?

350
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,260
Miss, if you want to find out where Lan'er is,

351
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,860
you need to have detailed information,

352
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,860
or the related items that you used for a long time.

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,860
They are right.

354
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,860
You are a real fortune teller.

355
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,860
Then...

356
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,860
Can you use his child?

357
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,660
Come on.

358
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,860
This is my niece, Megos.

359
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
We are not the master of the wind and storm.

360
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,260
We don't think we need to be taken before we get married.

361
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,260
But Lan'er ran away without a trace.

362
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,260
The one who took the debt found our family.

363
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,860
We must find him.

364
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,060
A genius with a color.

365
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,060
A scoundrel.

366
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,260
If it's a baby born, maybe it's okay.

367
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
But it's a pity.

368
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,260
It needs to wait for several months.

369
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
No need.

370
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,260
Excuse me, where is the nearest clinic?

371
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,660
What are you thinking about?

372
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,060
He is different from his father.

373
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,260
He is a very considerate child.

374
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,460
He kicks me every day.

375
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,060
He also knows how to blow his mouth.

376
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,460
He helps me to sleep.

377
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,060
Blow his mouth?

378
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,660
He is too strong.

379
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,860
Something wrong with his mind.

380
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,460
I won't let go of my child.

381
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,060
Megos, wake up.

382
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,660
A child who is a fraud will make your life full of suffering.

383
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,860
Miss Fan Mei.

384
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,860
Mr. Mo Lei, I thought you would come tomorrow.

385
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,060
I was going to.

386
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,660
But I had a dream.

387
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,060
I dreamed that Mr. Fanzent was with this man.

388
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,260
I saw this man.

389
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,860
About a month ago.

390
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,060
He had a fight with Mr. Fanzent at the door.

391
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,060
You suspect Mr. Fanzent's death is related to this man.

392
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,060
You know.

393
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,460
The dream of the Zhan Bu family may be the start of the spirit.

394
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
It's true.

395
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,860
Just like in the novel of Ms. Fulse.

396
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,860
Ms. Fulse?

397
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,060
In the detective novel of Ms. Fulse.

398
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,860
The murderer is often hidden by the victim.

399
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Angelica is the soul of the detective burning.

400
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,660
Did you hear what they said?

401
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,860
I can't remember.

402
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
I think they mentioned something.

403
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Something?

404
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,860
Could it be the main plot of the Hunnaji Temple?

405
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,660
The Dewei Library.

406
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
Sir.

407
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,860
These are the records of the Hunnaji's ancient chess.

408
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
Thank you.

409
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,060
The Hunnaji Temple?

410
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,660
The Hunnaji's iron ore investment fraud.

411
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,460
It's reasonable to look for information related to this.

412
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,660
This name.

413
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,460
Appeared at the end of May.

414
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,260
It disappeared after July 14th.

415
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,460
July 15th is Fanzent's death time.

416
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,060
It's Bifeng Tower.

417
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,060
Siris, Paripis.

418
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Xie Li Temple, Hua Ruipi Temple.

419
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
Could it be this person?

420
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Thank you.

421
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,060
May I ask where these ancient instruments are?

422
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
Over there.

423
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
It's her.

424
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
The person I saw in the cloth.

425
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
What a coincidence.

426
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
This is bad.

427
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
They look strong.

428
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Should we go?

429
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Don't worry.

430
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
We should follow the new person.

431
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
We should be careful.

432
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
I'll inform the captain first.

433
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
She ran away.

434
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Call the police.

435
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Okay.

436
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Oh no.

437
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
It's the time trap.

438
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
It's over?

439
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
I'm so lucky.

440
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
What a bad place.

441
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
The power of the battle is worse than mine.

442
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
The spirit body is dissipating so fast.

443
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,060
It's too late to ask the captain.

444
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Let's ask the formula of the evil monster first.

445
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
The formula of the evil monster.

446
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
The evil monster.

447
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,060
The evil monster.

448
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
The evil monster.

449
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
The formula of the evil monster.

450
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
The evil monster.

451
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
The spirit body is in the wrong place.

452
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Captain.

453
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,080
It's dangerous to lead the

454
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,060
non-human who lost control and was led by the front.

455
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Your luck can save you once or twice.

456
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,060
But not every time.

457
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
I'm a little too anxious.

459
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
I remember, captain.

460
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
There won't be next time.

461
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
You're so lucky.

462
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
I feel that you and the non-human

463
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,060
and these evil forces have a destiny.

464
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
The super mortal thing you've been through

465
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,060
is even more dangerous than what we've seen in a season.

466
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
The spirit body is dissipating.

467
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
It's too late to ask the captain.

468
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Mr. Z.

469
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
It seems to be an old friend of the assembly.

470
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Mr. Z.

471
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
The assembly number 22.

472
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
It's all in the letters.

473
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
In the notes of the Antikonus family,

474
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
I and Fansen really didn't find anything else

475
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
that was valuable.

476
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Except for the stuff I gave you last time.

477
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:05,060
The dyes, the school map and the formula of the evil monster.

478
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
I just got the formula of the evil monster.

479
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
But I quit the command post.

480
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
I have no other gains.

481
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,060
Okay.

482
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
But the truth of the formula of the evil monster

483
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
still has its confirmation.

484
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
What else did you write?

485
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,060
The Antikonus family must have left

486
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
a secret treasure that has been restored.

487
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
As the power that controls the Zhanbujia route,

488
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,060
they should have a certain understanding of the destruction itself.

489
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
There are enough reasons to believe

490
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,060
that the treasure is in the main peak of the Khonachis Mountains.

491
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Somewhere in the state of Yezhi.

492
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
And then,

493
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Mr. Z,

494
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
I am preparing for the destruction day.

495
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
And I hope to get your help.

496
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,060
When the destruction day comes,

497
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,060
I will tell the whole family of the Fengxianting family.

498
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
The humble

499
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Silis Aurepis.

500
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,060
She is indeed Silis.

501
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,060
The strange and scary route of the Antikonus family

502
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
is actually the route of the Zhanbujia family.

503
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
No wonder I can hear the Khonachis

504
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
after I take the drug.

505
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
What is that Freigla?

506
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
And that secret treasure.

507
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Is it true?

508
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Stop. Stop.

509
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
But there are a lot of people who died in the battle.

510
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
The complete treasure will only be more terrible.

511
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
I feel that you and the extraordinary

512
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
and these evil forces are in a fight.

513
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
The fight of fate.

514
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
The fight of fate.

515
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
Is it really not a coincidence?

516
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,280
The Antikonus

517
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,060
that the Mingxiu Society lost

518
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,060
directly caused the Khelan to shoot himself.

519
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
In the aftermath,

520
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
I was transferred to the Khelan.

521
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,060
And I was hidden by the diary of the Luo Seir.

522
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
I became the Zhanbujia.

523
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
And the Luo Seir wanted to choose the Zhanbujia

524
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
because of the Chalatu led by the Mingxiu Society.

525
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,060
The high-level shooters of the Zhanbujia route.

526
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
Oh my god.

527
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
What kind of fate is this?

528
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I just arrived at the library today.

529
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:34,820
The

530
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,060
day when the Khelan shot himself.

531
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Still not good.

532
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
It's true that you want to find the truth

533
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
just by using the Zhanbujia.

534
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
It's still too naive.

535
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
After all,

536
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Zhanbujia is not a thing that can be easily obtained.

537
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:32,060
Chalatu

538
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
This is
