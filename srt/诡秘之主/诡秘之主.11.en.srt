00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:55,460
Mr. President, yesterday, Mr. Meina De, former leader of the New Party, was in a bad situation.

5
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,460
He was sent to the sea of storm. I feel deeply regretful.

6
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,460
The former leader is a murderer! He is not Lu Huanyi!

7
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:12,460
Mr. President, Mr. Meina De died of heart disease.

8
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,460
Any rumors are insults to the dead.

9
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:29,460
We all know that disease, poverty, riot, panic, and the current situation are all at a standstill.

10
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Today, people are lost in the future.

11
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:44,460
I promise to unite the New Party and the conservative party, and become Mr. Meina De's will to promote the new administration.

12
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,460
The new administration decision has not been passed by the majority.

13
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,460
Be careful! You are openly violating the right and freedom of administration!

14
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,460
I will be a shadow of the people, and a light hope for the future.

15
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,460
You are a traitor!

16
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,460
I am promoting the new administration.

17
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,460
Let us stay away from chaos, poverty, crime, and the current situation.

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,460
We must stop the current situation and be free and happy.

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,460
The only way to break through is to follow the current situation.

20
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
The only way to follow the current situation is to follow the current situation.

21
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,460
The future is at stake!

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,460
This is the end of the world.

23
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,460
The future is at stake!

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,460
Well done. This is a reward for you.

25
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,460
You took me to a place.

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,460
I didn't expect Meina De's death to shock her.

27
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
I am sorry.

28
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,460
Follow the car ahead.

29
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,460
I hope the captain can explain everything.

These human-orrated robots are beneficiating the whole environment.

35
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:50,260
Hey.

36
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,140
Does Auntie UN has the tube?

37
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,860
What this is.

38
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,160
Is that really what she's having ?

39
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,480
Yes, experiences of rosehhh

Yeah.

Blind, depressed, painful, hopeless.

45
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,700
It's the perfect way to be a witch.

46
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,700
It seems that you are doing very well.

47
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
The core of the Shiyi Club is the new people.

48
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,700
No one knows men better than we do.

49
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,700
And no one knows women better than we do.

The

51
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I really appreciate your learning, but the accident of Meinard will affect my penetration of the kingdom.

52
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I don't want to see you again. If you can't control the fish, don't blame me for putting you back under the group.

53
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,400
My goods are bad now.

54
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,400
I wonder what they might buy.

55
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,600
The ship isn't abandoned?

56
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,900
All these are just outlaws of their own.

57
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Why shouldn't I?

58
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,800
Look, I haveぉ

59
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,360

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm here.

74
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
I'm here.

75
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm here.

76
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm here.

77
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm here.

78
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm here.

79
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
I'm here.

89
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm here.

I'm here.

96
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Did I call the wrong number?

97
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Oh, if I called myself,

98
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I should need to go to the club to answer the phone.

99
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
I really did call myself.

100
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:44,940
The sculpture matches Han Shou's

Ah- here we go rabbit.

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:58,200
Look at you.

112
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,860
Okay.

113
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,000
Hmm.

114
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,000
Hey!

115
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:44,120

No!

125
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
No!

126
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
What are you doing?

127
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
What are you doing?

128
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
What are you hiding?

129
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
What are you looking for?

130
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Wait for me!

131
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
What are you doing?

132
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
What are you doing?

133
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I am the light of the night.

134
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Come on, come on!

135
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Oh, you can't return.

136
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Don't laugh!

137
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
What are you doing?

138
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Oh, no!

139
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
What are you doing?

140
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
What is this?

141
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
It's a sudden struggle.

142
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,120
I've been standing here all day.

143
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
The bell has rung.

144
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,120
This continent is about to return to its proper order.

145
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Let this order start from the root.

146
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Come on, young professional, tell me your secret.

147
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,120
The end is your end.

148
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,120
The end is only when you follow me to the source.

149
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Only then can you get the sacred flower and the old tree.

150
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,120
The end is the secret.

151
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
Hurry up!

152
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Hurry up!

153
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Hurry up!

154
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Hurry up!

155
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Very good.

156
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
The last bell has finally appeared.

157
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Let's go!

158
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Let's go!

159
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Hurry up!

160
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Hurry up!

161
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Oh, my God!

162
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Oh, my God!

163
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Oh, my God!

164
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
It's too fast.

165
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
I can't keep up.

166
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm afraid of its movement.

167
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
It's weird.

168
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Oh, my God!

169
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Hurry up!

170
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Hurry up!

171
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Hurry up!

172
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Hurry up!

173
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Hurry up!

174
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Are you all right?

175
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm fine.

176
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I made a mistake.

177
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I was blinded by Xue Er.

178
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
I didn't expect that she had already escaped from the dream.

179
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I hope that you will be able to sleep soundly.

180
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I hope that your dark night will be bright and bright.

181
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Hurry up!

182
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Captain, I'll take care of the work downstairs.
