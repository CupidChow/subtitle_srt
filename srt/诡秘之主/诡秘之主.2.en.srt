00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Jordan

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,360
Human was subversive

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,980
with커

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Through healing

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:23,260
he can overcome

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,580
human beings

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,000
from peak state

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,240
and

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,240
can have the power to force the people into it.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,240
This evolution path will become

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,240
the path of the gods.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,240
The World of Tartarus

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Episode 05

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,240
The whereabouts of the Anti-Gonus family notebook

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
is not known. Your danger has not been exposed.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Or, you want to join us

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,240
and become an extraordinary person?

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,240
The World of Tartarus

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Episode 06

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
If you want to join us,

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,240
go to the Lieshuen Pavilion to find the old Varite.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Although it is possible for a professional to expose my power,

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
it is also a better protection color.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,240
And it is the best way to obtain the knowledge of the gods.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
That's right.

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Sorry.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
What the hell?

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
What are you looking at?

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Do you want to die?

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
We don't sell cow's milk, kid.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I want to hire a mercenary team. Mr. Lyt.

32
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
What era are you living in?

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,240
How can you have that kind of thing now?

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
Who told you to come here to find him?

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I am Smith.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Follow me.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Follow me.

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
The steam train from the city of Constantine

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
is flying today.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Who are you?

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Hello, I am Mollady.

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
The new member of the captain?

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Yes.

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Follow me.

45
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
My name is Luo Shan. I am Wen Zhi.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
We will be colleagues from now on.

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
It is my honor.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
We don't usually do much.

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I don't know why, but the cases of the illegal cases have suddenly changed a lot.

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,240
That is Luo Yao. Isn't she pretty?

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I didn't even talk to her.

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,240
That is Fulai. She looks cold, but she is a good person.

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
She even taught me how to draw.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Ke'en Li has been a professional for half a year.

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,240
But she is always nervous when she is on a mission.

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Go. The captain is right in front of you.

57
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Aren't you going with me?

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I have always been a little afraid of the captain.

59
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,240
I don't know why, but he is very loving and caring.

60
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
He gives me the feeling of a father.

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Isn't it normal to be afraid of your father?

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
That makes sense.

63
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I will be waiting for you.

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Have you thought about it?

65
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Ahuawajun Police Station Special Operations Department, Group 7.

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I thought we were called the Black Crystal Security Company.

67
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
That is just one of the many disguises.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Our Group 7 belongs to the Black Night Goddess Organization.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Secretly deal with the extraordinary events in the suburb.

70
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,240
From now on, you are our member.

71
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Welcome.

72
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Then I should call you captain.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes.

74
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
But there is one thing I must make clear.

75
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Those who become professionals will face the risk of losing control.

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Take this and come in with me.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Losing control?

78
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
The name of each person here belongs to a dedicated professional.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Most of them are far from extraordinary events.

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
They are the ancestors of the Tinggen clan.

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,240
We will remember them and follow them.

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
You know the legend of the window, right?

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,240
The creator woke up from the chaos and created the first light.

84
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
He turned himself into everything.

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
His eyes became the sun and became the red moon.

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,240
His body became the earth and the stars.

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
His hair became a dead bird.

88
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
His ears became the waves.

89
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Everything is the same.

90
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Humans can adjust their appearance with super-reverse objects.

91
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,240
They can master different paths.

92
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Paths?

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
I think I mentioned it yesterday.

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
The path of the 22-spirit god.

95
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
The dark goddess organized the four-step path of the knight's hunting skill.

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
If you don't mind, we can complete the path.

97
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
The master has a very good self-defense ability.

98
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
The person who destroys the path and the Zhan Bujia have advantages in the secret knowledge.

99
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
But they lack direct countermeasures.

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,240
I need to remind you that the path of Zhan Bujia is only the hunting skill.

101
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,240
You don't have to decide right now.

102
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
The first skill is to find Lao Taozi.

103
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
He will have a way to help you make the best choice.

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Okay, captain.

105
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
We are guardians.

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
We are also the ones who can fight against danger and death.

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,240
It seems that no matter what kind of demon you are,

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
the most important thing to go back is the secret knowledge.

109
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
The one who doesn't sleep can remove the dead directly.

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
The one who is in a coma and the Zhan Bujia.

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Which one is better?

112
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
This is a long-standing struggle.

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It seems to be far more than the high school entrance examination.

114
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
No one?

115
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
My goddess.

116
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
What's going on?

117
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Hello, my name is Kellen.

118
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
I know your name, young man.

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
But you have already told me that

120
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,240
you graduated from the History Department of Huo Yi University, right?

121
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
You can call me Lao Ni'er.

122
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It's not urgent to choose a series.

123
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Help me sort out the documents over there first.

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Okay, Mr. Ni'er.

125
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Deng En said that you are good at ancient Fusak language and Hermes literature.

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm not good at it.

127
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
I just study it for a long time.

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
You can start with something simple.

129
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Or something you are familiar with.

130
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
When you are familiar with it,

131
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
maybe you can help me to interpret these notes

132
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,240
from the death of the king of Laos.

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
The king of Laos?

134
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
The notes are almost finished.

135
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,240
I spent a lot of time to get these three notes.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
It is said that these strange symbols he invented

137
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
are all hiding the power of the gods.

138
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
But for more than 150 years,

139
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,240
no one can interpret its exact meaning.

140
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,240
But I have already interpreted several symbols

141
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
and confirmed that they represent numbers.

142
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
That is to say,

143
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,240
this is actually a diary.

144
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Oh my god,

145
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Chinese?

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,240
November 18th is a really amazing day.

147
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
I found a poor man trapped in the storm.

148
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,240
You are in the dark.

149
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
He is lucky.

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
He met me, the hero of this era.

151
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
January 1st, 1884.

152
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
A big New Year's party.

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Mrs. Frodo is really a great woman.

154
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Great Emperor,

155
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
you are so enthusiastic.

156
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
I have said it a thousand times.

157
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
The key to the demon's drug is not control,

158
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
but digestion.

159
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Not digging, but acting.

160
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
And the name of the demon's drug

161
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
is not only the core symbol,

162
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,240
but also the key to digestion.

163
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
What a big amount of information.

164
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Thank you for my mother's words.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Maybe I can find a way to go home.

166
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,240
The choice at the beginning was too hasty.

167
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Now it seems that

168
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
whether it is a scholar or a war thief,

169
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
it is a better choice.

170
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
What does it mean?

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Clarence.

172
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Mr. Neer.

173
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
What's wrong?

174
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Sorry.

175
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,240
I was trying to decipher and interpret this diary.

176
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Interpretation?

177
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
What a young man.

178
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,240
I always thought I would be the most special one.

179
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
You have an idea about the demon's drug, right?

180
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
I can tell you more about it.

181
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Listen to the human rights, eat enough food,

182
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
and trust your senior.

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Mr. Neer.

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
I have made a choice.

185
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
The war is not fake.

186
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
The war is not fake.

187
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Are you sure?

188
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I have to remind you carefully.

189
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Once you take the demon's drug,

190
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
you can never change it.

191
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
I know.

192
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
I will do as I please.

193
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,240
I didn't expect you to choose the war supplement.

194
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,240
You are just as good as I was.

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
The information you collected inspired me.

196
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I am very eager to learn about the secret.

197
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Yes.

198
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
The great emperor of Laos said

199
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
knowledge is power.

200
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Since you have chosen,

201
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
let's begin.

202
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
100 ml of pure water.

203
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,240
13 drops of herb juice.

204
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
7 pieces of mint leaves.

205
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
3 drops of poison.

206
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
9 pieces of blood.

207
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
The most important thing is

208
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,240
the blood of the god of death.

209
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,240
The last 50 drops of pure water.

210
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Good.

211
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Your war supplement is fake.

212
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
This thing can drink.

213
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
I really can't see the little guy dancing.

214
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
He Xiaoxuan just drinks like this?

215
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
What's wrong?

216
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
How about a glass of wine first?

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
I will dance with you.

218
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Mr. Ni'er, I didn't mean that.

219
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I know what you want to say.

220
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Don't be afraid.

221
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Don't hesitate.

222
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,240
The more you do this, the more it will affect the absorption of the fire.

223
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
The reason you are sitting here

224
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
is enough.

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Isn't it?

226
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
He Lian.

227
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Just applied the magic potion.

228
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
There is some power out.

229
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
This is normal.

230
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Now, focus.

231
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Think about it.

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Do you want to be the first in this world?

233
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Good.

234
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Now adjust your mind.

235
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
You can't be the first.

236
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,240
You can't be the first.

237
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Now adjust your mind.

238
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Imagine a world

239
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,240
where there is no purpose.

240
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Control your spirit.

241
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You must do as I say.

242
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Imagine a world where there is no purpose.

243
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
What's going on?

244
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Nothing.

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Focus.

246
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Find the feeling of the item.

247
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Now.

248
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Now.

249
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Now.

250
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
What are you thinking about?

251
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,240
The magic potion is not Fasa.

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
The magic potion is not Fasa.

253
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,920
test

254
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,440
test

255
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
I succed

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,440
congratulations, our seamsimal

257
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,640
no, you did buy

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,040
you will have a bright future

259
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,040
so?

260
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
You think i'm different.

261
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
This is a spiritual world.

262
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,840
You should be able to determine my health

263
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,280
by the color of the air.

264
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
It doesn't look healthy.

265
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,680
Is it really the same age?

266
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Oh!

267
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,480
There are eyes behind you.

268
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,880
Eyes?

269
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,760
Oh, don't worry about it.

270
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,280
It's just a proof of a magic.

271
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
That was...

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
Overusing the spiritual world

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
will make your spirit and soul become weak

274
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
and even hallucinate.

275
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
You've seen Lunnade, right?

276
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
I remember that guy.

277
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,240
When he was just using the demon drug to become an extraordinary person,

278
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,280
he just rolled down from the stairs.

279
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,520
So, everything has to be well-arranged.

280
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,080
If you can't control the spiritual world very well,

281
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,680
you can just like me,

282
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,600
knock on the door and knock on the door.

283
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,080
Use this as the switch to open the door.

284
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,360
Door?

285
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Oh!

286
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,960
Other than the spiritual world,

287
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,560
the spirit can also be used in the spirit world

288
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,280
to make up for the evil and the evil.

289
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,960
But that's it for today.

290
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,600
Before we end,

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,280
we'll use the materials we've used to make the demon bullets.

292
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,080
Here, let's clean up.

293
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,760
And don't forget to take these tickets

294
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,280
and go to Deng En to report to the police.

295
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,880
Tickets?

296
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
Report?

297
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,920
Thank you, great Luo Zai Er.

298
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,040
It's Luo Zai Er again.

299
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,840
You're very used to hearing what I say.

300
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,320
Whether it's a famous or a spiritual teacher.

301
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,520
Maybe it's just a special one from the Zhan Bu family.

302
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,000
In the extraordinary world,

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,440
special often means danger.

304
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,040
At first, you'll always hear or see something.

305
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,200
Curiosity will kill the cat.

306
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't try to find out

307
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,560
the words you shouldn't hear or see.

308
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,520
Remember that.

309
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,400
I know, Captain.

310
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
Before we become a real person,

311
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
you can use the documents for now.

312
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,320
Zhou Xin, three bags.

313
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,520
This is the salary you paid for the four regions.

314
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,440
Twelve bags.

315
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,160
Twelve bags?

316
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
Brother Helan's salary for the four regions

317
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,280
is only five or six bags.

318
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm so...

319
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,440
I'm so stupid to sell my poverty.

320
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Welcome next time.

321
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,320
You can go to buy a book first.

322
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,640
Then go to your house in the V-Land

323
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,920
and walk around the streets.

324
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
This is your daily task.

325
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,880
See if you can remember the whereabouts of that notebook.

326
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,320
Stop. Get in the car.

327
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,840
Stop.

328
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,720
As for the task,

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,240
Xia Hz.

330
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,640
Aren't we here to handle the extraordinary?

331
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,040
After all, we're pretending to be a security company.

332
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,840
The person in charge this time is the former head of the old company.

333
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,040
We helped him find the lost cat.

334
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
Don't be nervous.

335
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
Finding someone is the common sense of the Zhan Bu family.

336
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,340
This is his clothes. Open the book.

337
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,040
The new Mr. Zhan Bu Jia.

338
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,140
It's the locals' case.

339
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,260
Wow.

340
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,540
Why would such a small garden

341
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,240
and a share house be rusted away?

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,360
Such a stupid situation.

343
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,640
Such concerns.

344
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,240
Hey, don't bother.

345
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,720
why seems like President Lady点了面あり南风

346
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,280
is here.

347
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,440
This is No.1 Federal Bakery.

348
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,380
Here you can buy

349
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,620
some nice food there.

350
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,120
President Xu.

351
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Mr. Jue.

352
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Turn left.

353
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Turn right.

354
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
This is the place.

355
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
It's right here.

356
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Two bandits.

357
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Call a hostage.

358
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Very good.

359
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
One minute to finish.

360
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm...

361
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I used too much spirit.

362
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Three four five six seven.

363
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Follow.

364
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Bomb.

365
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Bomb.

366
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
What kind of bandit are you?

367
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Isn't it good to be a civilized person?

368
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Come on.

369
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Not much to see.

370
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Finish.

371
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Don't be afraid.

372
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It's okay.

373
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Who are these people?

374
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,120
A group of bandits who are regular guests in the dog restaurant.

375
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,120
It seems that this is not a simple kidnapping case.

376
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Finally.

377
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
It's interesting.

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Want to escape.

379
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Disappeared.

380
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Don't let him run away, Mr. Zhan.

381
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Still want to run away.

382
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
First shot.

383
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
That...

384
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Ah.

385
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I remember you.

386
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
I will not forget.

387
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I will not forget.

388
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
I will not forget.

389
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I will not forget.

390
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I will not forget.

391
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
I will not forget.

392
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
I will not forget.

393
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
I will not forget.

394
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
The ability of the five-leafed man will make him fall into the dust.

395
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
It's okay.

396
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Someone will handle it.

397
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Including the extraordinary memory.

398
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
What's wrong?

399
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Did you find anything new?

400
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
No.

401
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Here.

402
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I have been here.

403
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
The gun is not bad.

404
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
But I want to hit the head.

405
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I advise you not to move.

406
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Be careful of being stung.

407
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Aren't you afraid of being Perspective Master?

408
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Hmm...

409
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
I screwed up the eldest up.

410
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
I must be different.

411
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
I know what you're a lot about.

412
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Look at the bad luck this dog is holding.

413
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I am correct too.

414
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I messed up by being ﷻ by my side.

415
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I thought 10 minutes were passing by fast.

416
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Hey, you two.

417
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
It's no big deal.

418
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Come on, you are our own정피어.

419
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
If you guys are approved,

420
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
I'm very familiar with you.

421
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
What?

422
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
What else?

423
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
You have a special aura that attracts me.

424
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
You too.

425
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
You're weird.

426
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
You're weird.

427
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
You're weird.

428
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Do you see it?

429
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Do you see it?

430
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Indeed.

431
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
He's not special.

432
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
He's not special.

433
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
I'm sure you'll be happy

434
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
if you know

435
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
that I found a job

436
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
so quickly.

437
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
This is what you just saw.

438
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
What's going on?

439
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm already home.

440
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm going to the hospital.

441
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm going to the hospital.

442
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
I'm going to the hospital.

443
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm going to the hospital.

444
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
I'm going to the hospital.

445
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
I'm going to the hospital.

446
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
I'm going to the hospital.

447
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm going to the hospital.

448
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm going to the hospital.

449
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'm going to the hospital.

450
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm going to the hospital.

451
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm going to the hospital.

452
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I'm going to the hospital.

453
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
I'm going to the hospital.

454
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
I'm going to the hospital.

455
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
I'm going to the hospital.

456
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm going to the hospital.

457
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm going to the hospital.

458
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
The house opposite the house

459
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
is the clue

460
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
behind the Antikhanus' handwriting.

461
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Besides, we are not here to fight.

462
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Burn my broken shelter, no style.

463
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:10,120
To be free, is to hold a cup of wine.

464
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Where the flames have come, may fury.

465
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Where the keys that cause truth from end.

466
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,120
Into the dark to dream and scream.

467
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,120
My name, wonder and dismay.

468
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Man is or decay.

469
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,120
With fragile light I vow to guard the world.

470
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I stay during the delay.

471
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Rebirth or be saved.

472
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
With whispers engraved by my shadow.

473
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Fade away, fade away.

474
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Water Deity Flower Street, No. 2.

475
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,120
It should be here.

476
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Wen Sen.

477
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Welcome home.

478
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Wen Sen.

479
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Welcome home.

480
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,120
So we really have to live here?

481
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
No need to doubt, Wen Sen.

482
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,120
From now on, this is our home.

483
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Even if the contract of Iron Cross is not expired,

484
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,120
the stingy landlord will not agree to rent.

485
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Don't worry, I will communicate.

486
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:38,820
After all, his IQ is not as good as the

487
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,120
I have to wear it in good faith.

488
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
It's expensive, right?

489
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,120
I have been saving it for a long time.

490
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Hurry up and put it on and see if you like it.

491
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
It's really suitable.

492
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
It's really suitable.

493
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
I like it very much.

494
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Thank you, Wen Sen, Melissa.

495
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
A family, no need to thank.

496
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Come on, congratulations to Kellen.

497
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Find a good job.

498
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Celebrate that we have a new home.

499
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Live a better life after you get hospitalized.

500
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,120
The better it gets.

501
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Praise the Goddess.

502
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Thank you.
