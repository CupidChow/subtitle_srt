1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,760
えっ

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
Wait...

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,220
What's happening?

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,340
Oh...

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:52,340
Fundamental knowledge can be used to view tornaki books in manual憑

6
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,380
Yes, thank you

7
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,060
Non- perk world

8
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,300
Human beings have absorbed the demonors

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,300
The more numbers you have, the stronger your ability is.

10
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,300
Those with high power can possess the power of the divine.

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:18,300
This evolution will become the path of the gods.

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
The red smoke tribe I found...

13
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
...hasn't been captured yet.

14
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
It can't capture any new clues.

15
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,300
We can't even break through the power of the ashes.

16
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,300
The mother is very strong.

17
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,300
The strong mother is the one who can save the world.

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,300
She can even protect the world.

19
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,300
The human is the one who can save the world.

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,300
The strong mother is the one who can save the world.

21
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
The strong mother is the one who can save the world.

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,300
The strong mother is the one who can save the world.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,300
I have to think of a stronger foundation.

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Weapons...

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
...are nothing but curse.

26
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Curse?

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
That's right.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
The Yang Yan Curse.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,300
I have to think of a way to protect the eternal Yang hair.

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Keren.

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Mr. Azuka.

32
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Are you busy recently?

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
You look tired.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,300
I've been looking for the whereabouts of the black hand behind the scenes.

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
I'm a little anxious.

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Since the other person noticed my pillar,

37
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
he hasn't made any mistakes.

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Relax.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Don't be too persistent.

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Maybe the transition is in one thought.

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,300
I understand, Mr. Azuka.

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Mr. Azuka.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
There's something I want to ask you.

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Do me a favor.

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
A deserted island?

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
What is this?

47
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm very sorry, Mr. Azuka.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I couldn't find a new diary this week.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Don't worry.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,300
The cycle of this matter is destined to be long.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
But recently, I have been in contact with several secret circles of the extraordinary.

52
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
I hope to hand in more diaries.

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Mr. Azuka.

54
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Mr. Keren.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,300
I hope to get some information from the secret organization.

56
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Don't look at me.

57
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
You don't know anything about the rest.

58
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
There's no clear picture in the actual section.

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Most of these organizations are secretive.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
They are hidden in the dark.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
I only know the corner of the iceberg.

62
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,300
More than that, I can only find someone to help you find out.

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
This is very troublesome.

64
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
Please don't be too dangerous.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
I only need to find the corner of the iceberg.

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Even so, you still have to pay a great price.

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
P-Price?

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
What do you mean?

69
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
A thousand pounds.

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
An old factory that can't be linked.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Oh my god.

72
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
A thousand pounds?

73
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,300
It's like a set of tigress, a single mansion, and a corner of the iceberg.

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
It's too expensive.

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Miss Azuka is a noble.

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
I can't take out so much at once.

77
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
No problem.

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Should we send it to the previous address?

79
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Mr. Keren.

80
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,300
That's right.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
It's the same address.

82
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
The same recipient.

83
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Oh my god.

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
That's great.

85
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
A thousand pounds.

86
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Calm down, Zhou Mingrui.

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
It's just money.

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
You have to keep Mr. Yuche's dignity.

89
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
You can start now, Mr. Keren.

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Currently, there are about a hundred more influential secret organizations.

91
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
The fourth generation has been born.

92
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,300
There are the Secret Cultivation, the Witch Sect, and the Mori Kusho.

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,300
The first to be recognized was the Mori Kusho.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
The path they have mastered is called the Blood Cultivation.

95
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
The path of old Ni'er.

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,300
The members of this organization believe in the knowledge itself.

97
00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:14,560
And call it the hidden

98
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,300
The organization that was born in the early stage of this season has the Rose Blood Sect.

99
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
And the spirit cult of the Dead God.

100
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
They all originated in the South desert.

101
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:36,140
And the

102
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Mr. Yuche, we have no other questions.

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
Okay, that's it for today.

104
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
I respect your opinion.

105
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
The spirit cult of the Dead God.

106
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,300
It feels like it's related to Mr. Azk.

107
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
It's been days since I got rid of Mr. Azk.

108
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Did he forget?

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
It's a case of the Black Night Goddess.

110
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Is it only for the Black Night Goddess?

111
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Or is it different from the truth?

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Hello.

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Sir, what did you say?

114
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Wait a minute, I'll buy a newspaper.

115
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
Be careful.

116
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
An Sen?

117
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Melissa?

118
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Why are you back so early?

119
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Keren, that's a gun.

120
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Gun?

121
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Actually, I'm also a history consultant in the police department.

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Guns are for the release of goods.

123
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
I'll be very late today.

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Don't wait for me to eat.

125
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Is there any good news?

126
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
It looks very happy.

127
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
No one was hurt.

128
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
The black night goddess was killed.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
It should be Mr. Azk.

130
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,300
What are you rushing?

131
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
You haven't been here for 800 years.

132
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
You still want to go?

133
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Mr. Nie Er and...

134
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
It's him.

135
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
I told you I have a mission.

136
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
You can finish the mission.

137
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
You should know how to read the script.

138
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Come on, two glasses of Nangvier beer.

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
He'll pay.

140
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Old man, you know how to drink with me.

141
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Mr. Nie Er, hello.

142
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
What a coincidence.

143
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Come on, another glass.

144
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Or...

145
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,300
I know.

146
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
He paid.

147
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
Cheers.

148
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Cool.

149
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
You're in such a hurry.

150
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,300
I won't save you if you die in a gunfight.

151
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
You came for the dock, right?

152
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Yes, it's really a bad omen.

153
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
You're making a fool of yourself.

154
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
You only want to kill the black night goddess.

155
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:18,880
The dock is the place where the

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
It's hard to find.

157
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
It looks old.

158
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,300
It looks like the fourth season of the dead.

159
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm sure Mr. Azuka did it.

160
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
It's my turn now.

161
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Come on, I'll give you two a toast.

162
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
I have another mission.

163
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Next time you come to the bar,

164
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
we two old guys will be drunk.

165
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
By the way,

166
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
your name is Kellen, right?

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,300
I knew you were a talent.

168
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
How about joining us?

169
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Come on, let's go.

170
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Nie Er, you owe me two glasses of wine today.

171
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Next time you have to pay me twice as much.

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
Let's go.

173
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Mr. Furian is a good man.

174
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
You're a drunkard.

175
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Sorry to bother you.

176
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm looking for the captain.

177
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
The incident at the dock is very strange.

178
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
You're familiar with that place.

179
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Lunada and Kellen don't have enough experience.

180
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
You and them go and deal with it together.

181
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Me?

182
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Captain, let me go.

183
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
The sudden incident is strange.

184
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I think it should help.

185
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Yeah, that's what young people do.

186
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm so old.

187
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Recently, more than 50 people have been assigned to the dock.

188
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
I think Kellen is right.

189
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,300
I will help him to use the dock to track down the victims.

190
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Be careful.

191
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Don't act recklessly.

192
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I know, captain.

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Captain, I heard those spirits are hard to deal with.

194
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Is there any way to get rid of them quickly?

195
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
In this case, 30782 is the best.

196
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Oh, the convenient sun.

197
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,300
We got rid of the national treasure at the moment.

198
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
If this time...

199
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
No.

200
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,300
The dock is too risky.

201
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
If there are ordinary people at the dock,

202
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,300
it will be a waste of time if we don't get rid of them.

203
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
It's a bit urgent.

204
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
But we have to be careful.

205
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,300
If there is a strong ghost in those strange dead forests,

206
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,720
and there are the

207
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,300
If we can't control the situation in time,

208
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
we will come back to you to help.

209
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,300
I'm afraid the name of the unemployed person will not be easy to collect.

210
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Okay, but you have to pay more attention.

211
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
You can't stay in the same place for more than an hour.

212
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
I understand, captain.

213
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I will be waiting for you.

214
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
You want to do this with me on purpose, right?

215
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
But I advise you to give up the illusion of not being practical.

216
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Even in the mission, you can't find my secret.

217
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Who cares about your secret?

218
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Don't be so narcissistic, okay?

219
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Are you the professional officer?

220
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Yes.

221
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Hello, officers.

222
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
I have always been looking for the name of the professional.

223
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
I am the new captain of the dock.

224
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Please come with me, officers.

225
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
There are several ghost stories in the world.

226
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,300
This is the most serious place.

227
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Who are these people?

228
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
They must be possessed.

229
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Are you possessed?

230
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I have only seen such a beautiful man in the arms of the old man and the rich.

231
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Can you do it?

232
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
The two in the middle are not fully grown.

233
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Is this my old daughter?

234
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I heard there is something.

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
What is it?

236
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
At the age of one, the ghost did not run away.

237
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,300
The ghost did not run away, but he became a ghost.

238
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

239
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Go, go, go, go.

240
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
There are too many people here.

241
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Is it inconvenient for the officers to perform?

242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Please rest assured, we are really professional.

243
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,300
For this exorcism, we have prepared holy water, holy ash and garlic.

244
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
I read the newspaper and introduced it.

245
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
These are all the secret of exorcism.

246
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
The exorcists are really professional.

247
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Very good.

248
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
The officer in charge of the exorcism is going to be a ghost.

249
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,300
The Lord of the Lost Sands said that the situation must be more serious than the inside.

250
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
It's not too late.

251
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Let's start.

252
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
The Lord of the Lost Sands

253
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
The Lord of the Lost Sands

254
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
The Lord of the Lost Sands

255
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
The police are still looking for people.

256
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
What?

257
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,300
This exorcism is really good.

258
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Brother, don't expose me.

259
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,300
Be careful.

260
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
These are not ordinary people.

261
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Those who are exposed must be imprisoned for one minute.

262
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
3078 is starting to work.

263
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
What happened?

264
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I was just a little mistake.

265
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Next, our exorcist will officially start a ritual to purify the evil spirits.

266
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Why me?

267
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
The new person is Fuli.

268
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
The exorcist is coming.

269
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
What an awkward situation.

270
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
What is he doing?

271
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
What is he doing?

272
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
It's your turn.

273
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I am the exorcist of the evil spirits.

274
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I am the exorcist of the evil spirits.

275
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
He is describing the evil spirits in the story.

276
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
I am the exorcist of the evil spirits.

277
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I beg your power to purify the evil spirits.

278
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Is this really going to work?

279
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
It feels so warm.

280
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Yes, it's like the sun.

281
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
It's really amazing.

282
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
It's really a professional exorcism.

283
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Praise the goddess.

284
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
It's really a professional exorcism.

285
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Hurry up.

286
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Are you okay, lady?

287
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Mr. Fu Er'an?

288
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,300
He...

289
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,300
He just kicked me.

290
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Thank you, sir.

291
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
You saved our lives.

292
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
May the Lord bless you.

293
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
He looks much better now.

294
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
His family has already accepted this child.

295
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Fu Er'an, don't you have an urgent mission?

296
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Why are you here?

297
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Yes, that's right.

298
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I am responsible for following this poor girl.

299
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
See if I can find her fiance.

300
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
I can find her fiance.

301
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
She is in the whereabouts of Lan Erwusi.

302
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Lan Erwusi?

303
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
That ten thousand pounds of fraud?

304
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Yes.

305
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
I asked the police to investigate this case.

306
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Did they do anything extraordinary?

307
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
But they didn't find anything.

308
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
I guess they will use the common fraud to solve the case in the next two days.

309
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Drink less.

310
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Be careful not to drink too much.

311
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Death is a long-term solution.

312
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
That's good.

313
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm leaving.

314
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Mr. Ni Rui.

315
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
You and Mr. Fu Er'an have a good relationship.

316
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
We are old friends.

317
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
We have known each other for a long time.

318
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,300
We used to go to my house to drink and sing when we were free.

319
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Sarist was playing the piano for us.

320
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Sarist?

321
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Ah, my wife.

322
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Sarist has been gone for many years.

323
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Your old friends only have Fu Er'an and me now.

324
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Don't look like that.

325
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,300
The safety and return of this life is a blessing for us.

326
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,300
As long as we don't die without control, it's a blessing from the gods.

327
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Okay, go and clear the evil spirits in other places.

328
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
Hurry up.

329
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I won't be with you anymore.

330
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
It doesn't look strange.

331
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
All cleared.

332
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
It's so strange.

333
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Such a difficult spirit to clear.

334
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I didn't get hurt by the people who were brought back.

335
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
This is the first time I have encountered this kind of situation.

336
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
You can find the cause of the incident.

337
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
No problem.

338
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
The cause of the incident of the horse head spirit power.

339
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I can't find anything.

340
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
That's right.

341
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Mr. Azike has such a high taste.

342
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Unless he releases water, I can't touch anything.

343
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
What you see is the Dao Jin Temple in the South Continent.

344
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Whether it's the East West or the Highland Kingdom,

345
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,300
only the so-called death god Hou Yi can build such a spiritual flag for himself.

346
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Death god?

347
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
The evil spirit who was with the witch in the He Yuan Chu,

348
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
and caused the disaster in the North Continent.

349
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
The death god's faith map?

350
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
What's the purpose of building the evil spirit world?

351
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
Mr. Azike was born in a pile of corpses.

352
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Is it the battlefield of the disaster?

353
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,300
If Mr. Azike is really the death god Hou Yi,

354
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,300
then it's more worth to be careful if the black hand behind him takes away Mr. Azike's child's head.

355
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Let's do this first.

356
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Let's do this first.

357
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Next, the old rules.

358
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
One person takes 30782 array hand,

359
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
the others rest and recover.

360
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
One person takes turns.

361
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Finally, this moment has come.

362
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
The talisman spell of the dark goddess Li Yu has been burned out.

363
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
This thing is even more powerful.

364
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Burn the gold directly.

365
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I must succeed once.

366
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
What?

367
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
What's this?

368
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I must succeed once.

369
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I must succeed twice.

370
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
I must succeed twice.

371
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I must succeed once.

372
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
I must succeed twice.

373
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I want to ask you...

374
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I want to ask you to give me the power to complete the talisman spell.

375
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:31,300

You

385
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
We must get rid of him on the ship.

386
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
We must not let him cross the river again.

387
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
You leave now at 30782.

388
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Ge Li!

389
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Go!

390
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Don't rush!

391
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
This way! This way!

392
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
We must separate the group!

393
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Safety is at least 50 degrees!

394
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Roger!

395
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Find a way to inform the security.

396
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Don't get close!

397
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Go!

398
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Go!

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Go!

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Ge Li!

401
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
How did you manage to kill Bai Jue?

402
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Brother!

403
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Go!

404
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
This works too?

405
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
My power is loading!

406
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Ah!

407
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
I will not let you escape!

408
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I will not let you escape!

409
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
I will not let you escape!

410
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Fu Erhan...

411
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Mr. Fu Erhan!

412
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
He has completely lost his mind.

413
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
There is no turning back.

414
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
Let me do it.

415
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Mr. Ni'er, your hand...

416
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Let me do it.

417
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Let me do it.

418
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
I am going to kill you.

419
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Old Ni'er usually looks happy.

420
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,300
But at home, he is so depressed and angry.

421
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,300
The wife of the old woman,

422
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Mrs. Charlies.

423
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Mr. Fulham,

424
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,300
why did you suddenly lose control?

425
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
The old woman is a woman.

426
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,300
She is a woman.

427
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,300
She is a woman.

428
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,300
She is a woman.

429
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,300
She is a woman.

430
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Episode 16

431
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Whether it was when we were drinking,

432
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
or when we were at the dock,

433
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,300
there was nothing strange.

434
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
What was the cause of the short time

435
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,300
that caused the loss of control?

436
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I said there was no way to find it.

437
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
But the extraordinary loss of control

438
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,300
was more horrible than I thought.

439
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Two eyebrows, two eyes, two hands.

440
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
And the power of the divine.

441
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Whether it was the shadow of the pen,

442
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
or the black hand behind the eyes,

443
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,300
I should have the power of battle.

444
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
But this life-saving card,

445
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
I can't deal with the extraordinary loss of control.

446
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
The captain said,

447
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,300
most professionals die in the loss of control.

448
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Then I and the captain,

449
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,300
can't escape this fate?

450
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
What are you afraid of?

451
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Even the shadow of the god can be used.

452
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,300
There is always a way to solve everything.

453
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Could it be that the higher the control of the body,

454
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300
the stronger the extraordinary power,

455
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
it can reduce the risk of time and space?

456
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
Maybe I can find a chance

457
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
to reveal the acting to the captain.

458
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,300
It's time to save the life.

459
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,560
The

460
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560

462

464
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
The

465
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
The

466
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
The

467
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
The

468

469
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560

The

472
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
The

473
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
The

474
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
The

475
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
The

476
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
The

477
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
The

478
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
The

479
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
The

480
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
The

00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
The

482
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
The

483
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
The

484

Fade away

491
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,320

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,900

Episode 2

495
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

496
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

497
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Second sister, it's the new day again.

498
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Are we still waiting for the money from the last month?

499
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
The wind storm organization gave us the money.

500
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
But we lost half of it and we still have to dig deeper.

501
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
I have nothing left.

502
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
What should we do?

503
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,980
Are we, the legal entities, really going to do the pirate's trap?

504
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Don't worry.

505
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Give me one day.

506
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,980
I will give you double the money.

507
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
Are you out of money, second sister?

508
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,980
The justice of the Tarot Club promised to give me one thousand.

509
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,980
But can we really get it in such a short time?

510
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

511
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

512
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

513
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

514
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

515
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Why did we lose so much money?

516
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
The new leader of Chaoxin!

517
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,980
It seems that the Tarot Club can not only help me to become stronger,

518
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,980
but also become my way of life.

519
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
A thousand cheques that are not connected,

520
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,980
I think Miss Justice has also spent a lot of effort.

521
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Oh, my little sister.

522
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,980
You have figured out a way to solve the government's mess and low efficiency.

523
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Yes, dad.

524
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Exam.

525
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Every year, a test is held against all public officials.

526
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
The officials of the government departments are selected.

527
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,980
The officials can make the kingdom function effectively.

528
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Even if all those officials become a mess, it does not matter.

529
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Oh, my little sister.

530
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
You have really done a great job.

531
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,980
You even came up with a suggestion that even the cabinet could not give.

532
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Of course.

533
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,980
This is the suggestion given by Mr. Yu.

534
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,980
It is the suggestion of God.

535
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
You are indeed my daughter.

536
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,980
You have done a great favor to me.

537
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I will give you extra pocket money.

538
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Every month, I will add...

539
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
...a thousand.
