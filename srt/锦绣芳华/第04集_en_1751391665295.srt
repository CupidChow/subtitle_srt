Jinxiu Fanghua

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You won't blame me for being rude, will you?

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Of course not

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't be too hard on yourself

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If it wasn't for the fact that Lianzhou is not good for staying in the mansion

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I wouldn't have come to disturb you

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you talking about?

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You should come to my mansion more often

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I chose the wrong person for Lianzhou

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, I'll choose another beautiful lady for Suizhi

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and send her to my mansion every day

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not in good health

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If Lianzhou hadn't been re-established

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I wouldn't have been able to live in this mansion

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't think she would be like this

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I only care about your beauty

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Fine, I'll do as you wish

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
By the way

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The position of the Minister of Revenue has been vacant

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Many officials in the court have recommended it

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's hard to find a saint

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How are you doing today?

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's such an important position

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's hard to be in good health if you are absent for a day

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Minister of Revenue Zheng Shoude

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What do you think of him?

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He has been well-known for years

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He is rich

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Many officials in the capital praise him

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He is a good man

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But it's a pity that the Changan City, Luyao and Hanyuan Hall are high

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He is a man of the heart of the country

49
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But he is not a saint

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There are many people in the capital

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why can't they get the country of the emperor?

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's not the time to be a saint

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The treasures in the palace should be carefully selected

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's the most important thing to make people happy

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The things you have will be delivered to the mansion later

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please select the best for him

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not talented

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will share the burden with the king

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Jiang's mansion is finally quiet

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I made two eye-cups for you

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are too kind

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How about adding more wine?

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you know what the foreigners said?

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They said I was jealous of Lian Zhou

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was jealous of him

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But they didn't dare to say that I was kind, cunning and narrow-minded

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I made such a bad name for the general

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You just give me a good wine

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Lian Zhou has been in the mansion for a long time

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why do you care about the ceremony?

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:57,620
You are the one who is responsible for the investigation, layout and

74
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm just kidding

75
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,620
Why are you so serious?

76
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,620
We have nothing to do with each other

77
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
I have to be honest with you

78
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:20,620
Just add some more

79
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Lian Zhou is in trouble

80
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
Ning Wang must have been under pressure

81
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
You should have found out earlier

82
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620
If you are poisoned because of me

83
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,620
Enough

84
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
I'm so smart

85
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I have no ifs and buts

86
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Don't make a fuss

87
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Okay

88
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
The little flower shop is cunning

89
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
There is no trap

90
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,620
You can't avoid it

91
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
I'm sorry

92
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm sorry

93
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
acquaintance

94
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
meeting

95
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
I heard Liuchang houses a man

96
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:14,420
first

97
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,060
You may prepare a scriptrees for your operation,

98
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,920
so we can track down that never-before-seen clique,

99
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,980
let them haunt our hideout.

100
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:37,220
After that, the

101
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,360
secret inside me can be easily Jangled.

102
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,120
Such a great ability could only be achieved

103
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
by producing secrets of the intÃ©ressant gang.

104
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,800
She's the one who does the

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,520
Newlyweds' wedding.

106
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,180
I only know that General Xiao and Prince Ning are close friends.

107
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,460
There are many people who know each other.

108
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,940
The eldest daughter of the Xiao family came to Chang'an a few days ago.

109
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,300
The eldest daughter of the Xiao family gathered with the eldest princess.

110
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,220
The eldest princess allowed her to live in the villa.

111
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,140
The eldest daughter and the eldest son grew up together.

112
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,420
She said that the eldest son knew her habits the best.

113
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,220
The eldest princess gave her this job.

114
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,340
The eldest princess liked the Xiao family.

115
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,420
She didn't want to keep her by her side,

116
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,220
but she wanted to let her live here.

117
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,840
She wanted to get along with Jiang Chaoyang.

118
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,140
No, no.

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,180
The Xiao family was invited by Prince Ning.

120
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,800
He values the Xiao family.

121
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,760
He wanted to make her a matchmaker.

122
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,020
He wanted to make her a matchmaker.

123
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,480
The choice has been made.

124
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
It's Pei Zhong, the deputy of the Shang family.

125
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
You just arranged your daughter.

126
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,440
And now you're arranging someone else's daughter.

127
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,780
The newlyweds' wedding is always a surprise.

128
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,520
They are not as free as our husband.

129
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,340
The bride and groom is expected nations.

130
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,060
Congratulations!

131
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,140
LittleFinally!

132
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,520
You lookantly drawn up!

133
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,280
Bride and groom come into the palace?

134
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,160
He doesn't look likely.

135
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,440
She doesn't even look handsome!

136
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Are you Miss Xiao?

137
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
You've met before?

138
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Miss Xiao saved my life.

139
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
She saved my life.

140
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
You're fated to meet.

141
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
It seems that I owe you a favor.

142
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I saved Miss Xiao.

143
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I owe you a favor, too.

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I saved her life.

145
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm lucky to have saved her.

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I don't owe you anything.

147
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
You said you'd give her a color.

148
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Now I'm here to prepare.

149
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
You're back to your home.

150
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
You came to Chang'an last year.

151
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Why didn't you come here last year?

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I came here last year because my grandmother was ill.

153
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I brought her to the doctor.

154
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Xuexi and her grandmother were very close.

155
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
They took care of her every day.

156
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
They were in no hurry.

157
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Now your grandmother is very healthy.

158
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
She misses her family.

159
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
She misses her family.

160
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
When she's well, we'll go home.

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
We came in a hurry.

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
We didn't have time to eat at your wedding.

163
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
At my wedding?

164
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
I don't need good wine.

165
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
You can drink as much as you want.

166
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Come to the garden at any time.

167
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll drink with you.

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Since you're from Suizhi,

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
you don't need to see me.

170
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Call me Xuexi in the future.

171
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Okay, Xuexi.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,440
You don't like Mrs. He's flowers.

173
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm happy about it.

174
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
So I sent you out of the palace.

175
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Thank you.

176
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Please.

177
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Xuexi is so beautiful.

178
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Yes.

179
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
She's so beautiful.

180
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,440
She's a beautiful lady.

181
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm so happy to see Xuexi.

182
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Go play.

183
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Oh, my God!

184
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Thank you for your help.

185
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
You're not hurt.

186
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
My lady.

187
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
My lady.

188
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
It's the first time Xuexi is in Chang'an.

189
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Why is she late?

190
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
It's you, Mrs. Xiao.

191
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
On the way here,

193
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
a child was hit by a carriage.

194
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
I sent him to the hospital.

195
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
I made sure he was okay.

196
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm sorry, Mrs. Xiao.

197
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
It's okay.

198
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
The life of a child is important.

199
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
You're right.

200
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You don't have to apologize.

201
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I'm not late.

202
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I think you're just in time.

203
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Otherwise, who will come to see Xuexi?

204
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
The first princess and Jiang Changyang

205
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
and Xiao Xuexi are in a relationship.

206
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
They are close friends.

207
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
They are very close.

208
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Even if the guards of the guards

209
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
have their father's sword,

210
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
they can't be separated.

211
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
They've been together for a long time.

212
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
They're not even a decade apart.

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm sure that

214
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
the first princess and Jiang Changyang

215
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
will be together for a long time.

216
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm sure that

217
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
the requirements of war are be given to two birds of grass.

218
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
You've done very well.

219
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Maybe you will see each other one day.

220
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,440
epidemic

221
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's have a taste test.

222
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
If you feel uncomfortable,

223
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
let's have a taste test.

224
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Three nine-tailed fox, let's have a taste test.

225
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Let's continue to watch.

226
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:23,480
Perfectly

227
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:33,480
talking to one another.

228
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:41,200
Hope we see each other again.

229
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,340
project.

230
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:51,900
Sum permission P.

231
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,300
You're a flower, a sharp and sour pail.

232
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm doing this for your own good.

233
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Why did you bring me here?

234
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,100
Why didn't you let Da Fu and Chuan Yu follow you?

235
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,900
Do I need a reason to go on a trip with you?

236
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,900
Jiang Chang Yang doesn't need a reason.

237
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,300
But the Flower Bird Division never has any good intentions.

238
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Isn't that Xue Xi?

239
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Oh, I see.

240
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
So you came here today for Xue Xi.

241
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
No wonder.

242
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,900
The first time I saw Xue Xi, I was a hero.

243
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,900
The whole Chang'an city was inspired by her.

244
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
I can't sit here anymore.

245
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Isn't it the Flower Bird Division that loves to eat porridge

246
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
and occasionally plays with the two of them?

247
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
You're so stubborn.

248
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
So what if I care?

249
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
There's no outsider here.

250
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,900
When we were kids, we lived in Jiangnan for a few years.

251
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
My mother liked girls.

252
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
So she loved Xue Xi like a daughter.

253
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,900
I only treated her as my sister.

254
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
Okay, okay.

255
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Anyway, you're just like siblings.

256
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
That's no surprise.

257
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
I'll take you to the bar now.

258
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Prince Ning chose Pei Zhong.

259
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
If I go to disturb him,

260
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
others will misunderstand.

261
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I'm trying to save Prince Ning's face.

262
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Is there a small place where the Flower Bird Division is misunderstood?

263
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
This is your life.

264
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Show your courage.

265
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Go.

266
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,900
I told you, there's no love between a woman and a man.

267
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Do you want me to jump into the river to get my heart?

268
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
No need.

269
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Why are you getting married to me?

270
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
It's really strange.

271
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Now the fish is full of water.

272
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
It's time to watch the beautiful scenery.

273
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Why did they cover the beautiful scenery?

274
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Unless they're not here to appreciate the scenery.

275
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
What are you doing?

276
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Good.

277
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
People cannot come home to drink.

278
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
They're not listening.

279
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:03,080
We'll drink

280
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Bring me your best wine.

281
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Thank you, sir. I'll go right now.

282
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Wait.

283
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Husband, didn't you say that there is a lady here who plays pipa?

284
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,900
It's so beautiful. Why don't you bring her here and help us?

285
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Okay.

286
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,900
She is playing for another guest.

287
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Who dares to steal from me?

288
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Go tell her that I'll pay for her.

289
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Who is it?

290
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
It's the commander of Zhichong's mansion.

291
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,900
He asked us not to disturb him before the meeting.

292
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Oh, it's Brother Pei.

293
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,900
It doesn't matter. I'll go see him in person.

294
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,900
He will give me Qiu Niang.

295
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
Lead the way.

296
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll have another cup for Miss Xiao.

297
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,900
I'm not feeling well.

298
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Please call me Miss.

299
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,900
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
It's not clear yet.

301
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Wear this.

302
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Learn to stay in the guesthouse.

303
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,900
You gave me medicine?

304
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Guards!

305
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Ahuai!

306
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,900
You and I are not related.

307
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Why don't you marry me?

308
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
We are meant to be.

309
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
And you are the one who is meant to be.

310
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Why do you want to ruin our family?

311
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Tell me.

312
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Let's go.

313
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Brother Pei!

314
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Why did you stop at the Yoyang House?

315
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,700
You're here, brother.

316
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,900
I and Aishe Fanzhou almost fell into the water.

317
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I got a little wine from the bar.

318
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,900
I want to have a drink with you.

319
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
I want to drink with you.

320
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
I want to drink with you.

321
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
You disturbed me, Brother Pei.

322
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Didn't you tell me that there's only a official in the bar?

323
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
You tricked me.

324
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
You brought the beauty yourself, right?

325
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
I want to see which one is the bride.

326
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Brother Pei.

327
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Husband, don't come in.

328
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
Xuanxi.

329
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Brother Pei is brave.

330
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
She is a girl from the Xiao family.

331
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
You were looking at each other.

332
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Why did you use this method?

333
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Who do you want to marry?

334
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
You and I know each other.

335
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Fair competition, fair skills.

336
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I am a family with the King.

337
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
Now I have a wife.

338
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Why should I ruin your good deeds?

339
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,900
If so, take your people away.

340
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
The King is not ordinary.

341
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
He is broken.

342
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
He can continue to do things.

343
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,900
A great man is not as good as a woman.

344
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
With the heart of Xiao Xuexi,

345
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,900
if he wakes up and finds out that you are dead,

346
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
he will never come down.

347
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
If you want to make a big trouble,

348
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
you force him to commit a crime.

349
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,900
He will either die or die.

350
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
If the Xiao family really loves you,

351
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,900
then who will the King give up for the peace of the Xiao family?

352
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
The flower bird is...

353
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
The painting...

354
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,900
It seems that the poison scatters.

355
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
If it wasn't for your accidents,

356
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
I would suffer the worst.

357
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Xuexi, it's all in the past.

358
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,900
You hardly spend the rest of your lives

359
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
You have to spend your life with him.

360
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Remember,

361
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,900
nothing is more important than your life.

362
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,900
But today I'm not the only one.

363
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Pei Chongxiang, I'm the only one who can save the Xiao family.

364
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
If the Xiao family is killed by such a villain,

365
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
there will be no hope.

366
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Please.

367
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
I thank you on behalf of the Xiao family.

368
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
Thank you.

369
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
If my mother were alive,

370
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
seeing you so strange,

371
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
I would not have loved you.

372
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
But I want to hit you.

373
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
If Pei Chongxiang fails,

374
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
he will not spread this news.

375
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
This is too much.

376
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I have found out that

377
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,900
the fall of the Flower Banquet is also the result of Pei Chongxiang's doing.

378
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
He is very anxious.

379
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Be careful of him in the future.

380
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm sorry.

381
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Xuexi,

382
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
why don't you tell the Princess the whole thing

383
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
and let her make the decision for you?

384
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
If I don't agree to this marriage,

385
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
the Xiao family will definitely go back to the King.

386
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
If Pei Chong gets punished because of me,

387
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
he will offend you.

388
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
I'm the daughter of the Xiao family.

389
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
I have to be a part of the family.

390
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,900
How did you know that Pei Chong was good at disguise?

391
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Pei Chong looks gentle and gentle.

392
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
He has no power of martial arts.

393
00:26:37,900 --> 00:27:02,680
But he is the most

394
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
I understand.

395
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
You can't just remind Xuexi.

396
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,900
Because Pei Chong has no flaws in front of the witness.

397
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
And you are a flower bird.

398
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
You shouldn't know the secret of the court.

399
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Don't worry.

400
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
I will keep it a secret for you.

401
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
I will cooperate with you in any useful place in the future.

402
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
As long as you are a flower bird,

403
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
you can't be a secret.

404
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
I will keep it a secret for you.

405
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
I will keep it a secret for you.

406
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
I will keep it a secret for you.

407
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
I will keep it a secret for you.

408
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
And you can buy it in the future.

409
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
That's enough.

410
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Let's go.

411
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Jiang Changyang.

412
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
I think that

413
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
every time I think I know you enough,

414
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
I will find more secrets in your heart.

415
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Are you tired?

416
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
When I see a secret,

417
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
I don't ask why people are always together.

418
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Why am I tired?

419
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
The court officials are reading the letter again.

420
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
They are asking for the saint's blessing.

421
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
They want to give the son of Consort Shu as the crown prince.

422
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
The old king is smart.

423
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,900
He is very fond of the saint.

424
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Consort Shu is the daughter of the general.

425
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
She has a high reputation in the old city.

426
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
She is the one who can suppress the king.

427
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
Do you have any countermeasures?

428
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
It will be done sooner or later.

429
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Since the saint likes the old king,

430
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
it's done.

431
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
It doesn't matter who the crown prince is.

432
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
What matters is who he is with.

433
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
As long as the old king becomes the son of Consort Hui,

434
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,900
the crown prince will be the crown prince of the king.

435
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Why are you so worried?

436
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
You are really thoughtful.

437
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
I will leave it to you.

438
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Yes.

439
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Give it to her.

440
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Yes.

441
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Give it to her.

442
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Thank you, Consort Shu.

443
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Sit down.

444
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
This is the golden-pickled sweet potato.

445
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
It's very tasty.

446
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Thank you.

447
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
You are welcome.

448
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Thank you.

449
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Thank you.

450
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Thank you.

451
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Thank you.

452
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,900
Thank you.

453
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Thank you.

454
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Thank you.

455
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
Thank you.

456
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
Thank you.

457
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,900
Thank you.

458
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,500
junti

459
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,900
official

Jerusalem

meter

quite

466
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
but

467
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
it is

468
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
used in

469
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Canna

470
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,340
and

471
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
You're so thoughtful.

472
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Cao Lei!

473
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,340
Cao Lei!

474
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
There's a lot of people here!

475
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,340
Send the goods!

476
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,340
Yes!

477
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
Cao Lei!

478
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Cao Lei!

479
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Cao Lei!

480
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,340
This case was done by Jiang Shaoqing.

481
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,340
He's the one who wrote this letter.

482
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Take Jiang Shaoyang down!

483
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,340
Cao Lei!

484
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Consort Shu, only the golden milk cup in front of you was poisoned.

485
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
The rest is fine.

486
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,340
Jiang Shaoqing has always been a good person.

487
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Why did he make such a mistake today?

488
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,340
If he's just being careless, then it's fine.

489
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Consort Shu, you must investigate it thoroughly.

490
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,340
Be careful, someone might have other thoughts.

491
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
The new palace is bought by the Yings.

492
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Everyone is responsible.

493
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,340
It's not easy to take care of it.

494
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,340
There are many people who know how to do it.

495
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Everyone can do it.

496
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,340
I don't know who they are.

497
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Consort Shu is right.

498
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Take these workers down and investigate it thoroughly.

499
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Someone will tell the truth.

500
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Consort Shu, I saw Jiang Shaoqing say something to you before I went to the kitchen.

501
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
It was so far away. I didn't hear what he said.

502
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,340
What did Jiang Shaoqing say?

503
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
He just...

504
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,340
He just told me to look at the golden milk cup and I was wrong.

505
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Jiang Shaoqing never went to the kitchen during the feast.

506
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Why are you so sad today?

507
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I know that Xue Xi is a kind and kind person.

508
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I know that she's being watched by the Princess.

509
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,340
I know that she's very kind to the golden milk cup.

510
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,340
Consort Shu, these gold cups are hidden in the inner shirt of Wei Qiao.

511
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,340
I didn't know that the inner shirt is so high.

512
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Take this eunuch down.

513
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,340
If you don't find out the truth, you're not allowed to die.

514
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Yes, Your Highness.

515
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Shaoqing, believe me. You can't just die.

516
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Please save me.

517
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,340
Father, didn't you want to take Jiang Changyang away?

518
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,340
Why did you give him the poison this time?

519
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:06,340
I want to know if you have any other personal intentions.

520
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Father was found suspicious.

521
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
He was very mysterious.

522
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,340
He never found out his identity.

523
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,340
According to his people,

524
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
the only place he went to twice was the maguan hall of Jiang Changyang.

525
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,340
The business of the temple is always about the people.

526
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,340
It's not a big deal to go there.

527
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Your Highness, you can't be careless.

528
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
If Jiang Changyang is involved in something,

529
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,340
you can kill him with one arrow.

530
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
If he has nothing to do with Jiang Changyang,

531
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,340
you can kill him and sell him to someone else.

532
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:53,340
I want to save Jiang Changyang from someone else.

533
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Uncle Zi.

534
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
No.

535
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Do as Uncle Zi said.

536
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Don't be willful.

537
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,340
You can't just die. Please save me.

538
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,340
This eunuch is so scared.

539
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Jiang Shaoqing has nothing to say?

540
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
I don't know him.

541
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
What can I say?

542
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,340
You can go to the palace every day.

543
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
If you want to kill someone,

544
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
you can do it when there are few people.

545
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,340
You can even arrange for your men to buy the arrow.

546
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,340
Why are you so aggressive?

547
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,340
Why do you want to kill the arrow yourself?

548
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
I'm not a wise woman.

549
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,340
I can find out the truth of the crimes.

550
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,340
You dare to talk to the nobles in front of the nobles?

551
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
It's not the time for outsiders to talk.

552
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
If you really want to poison Consort Shu,

553
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
I'm Shaoqing's concubine.

554
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Why should I steal the food and drink?

555
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Why should I stop Consort Shu from eating the vinegar?

556
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Mudan is right.

557
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,340
I'm close to the saint.

558
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,340
The saint loves Consort Shu and the old king.

559
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,340
I have no reason to steal Consort Shu.

560
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Don't you like gold?

561
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
As long as you tell the truth,

562
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
who is the one who set the trap?

563
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,340
I can plead for you and spare your life.

564
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,340
I'll give you twice the gold.

565
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,340
I don't know.

566
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
I believe in you.

567
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,340
You should find out the truth.

568
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,340
I haven't solved the case yet.

569
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,340
I need to find out the truth.

570
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Okay.

571
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,340
You go back to the mansion.

572
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
If there's any question,

573
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,340
you can ask me.

574
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Consort Shu, before the case is solved,

575
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
the suspect can't be released.

576
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Otherwise, the royal family will be in danger.

577
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Yesterday, the saint asked about the old king's lessons.

578
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,340
He said that the law is not good and the god can't be disobeyed.

579
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
As the master of the palace,

580
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,340
Consort Shu should be punished.

581
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Don't let the saint down.

582
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,340
I'll go to the temple for a few days.

583
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,340
I believe that Consort Shu and the saint will pay me back.

584
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
What are you doing?

585
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Go and get some water for my husband.

586
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,340
The prison is too dirty.

587
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
I need to clean it up.

588
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
So he can rest in peace.

589
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Yes.

590
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,340
When the court was investigating Liu Chang's death,

591
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
he was in the prison.

592
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
He was a good man.

593
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,340
When Liu Chang was in the prison,

594
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,340
he reported that someone was following him.

595
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
Prince Ning was in trouble.

596
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
I'm afraid he suspected me.

597
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Do you want to inform the saint to calm down?

598
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
This is not suitable for this place.

599
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
Change another one.

600
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Yes.

601
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
This step...

602
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Mister, the step is on the way.

603
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,460
If the

604
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,340
set up is completely hidden,

605
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Liu Chang can't find any clues.

606
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,340
He will suspect that I'm involved.

607
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Why don't we

608
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,340
take the opportunity?

609
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Can you let me in?

610
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,340
No one is allowed to enter.

611
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
I know.

612
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,340
I'll stay here for a week.

613
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Half a week is fine.

614
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
I'll talk to my husband and leave.

615
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
You can take this.

616
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
You can't do that.

617
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,340
There's a valley in the capital.

618
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Go or not,

619
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
you're welcome.

620
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
I'm leaving.

621
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Mudan.

622
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Xuexi.

623
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,340
Mudan is so elegant.

624
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,340
You're giving her this?

625
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,340
She's single.

626
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,340
I want to make a living for her.

627
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,340
I brought some clothes and food.

628
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
How's the case going?

629
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
The arrow is heavily shot.

630
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
But the arrow is still

631
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
a bite of poison.

632
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
So there's no other witness?

633
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
Shen Ren and Shu Fei

634
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
all believe in the arrow.

635
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
The case will be solved.

636
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Don't worry too much.

637
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
But

638
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
it's rare for her to live here.

639
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
I don't know

640
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
what she's thinking.

641
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Let's go in and see.

642
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,340
She said no one is allowed in.

643
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
I'll take you in.

644
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
The princess told my wife

645
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
to send some food to the flower birds.

646
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Yes.

647
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Lead the way.

648
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
This way, please.

649
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
You know who did this?

650
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,340
I can help you.

651
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I can help you.

652
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,340
You stopped Shu Fei

653
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
and made trouble for others.

654
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
The poisoners will hate you.

655
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
You can't get involved in this.

656
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
But you're here.

657
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
I can't leave you alone.

658
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I can't help you.

659
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I can't help you.

660
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
I can't help you.

661
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,340
I can't help you.

662
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
I can't help you.

663
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
I can't help you.

664
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
But I can help you.

665
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,340
I can help you.

666
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
They're trying to frame you.

667
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,340
They're trying to frame you.

668
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
How can you make a mistake?

669
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
I have my own way.

670
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
I'll go out.

671
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
You stay in the mansion.

672
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Don't show yourself.

673
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Be careful with Liu Chao and the county magistrate.

674
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
Liu Chao.

675
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
Liu Chao.

676
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,340
Liu Chao.

677
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,340
Liu Chao.

678
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
Liu Chao.

679
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
Liu Chao.

680
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
Liu Chao.

681
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
Liu Chao.

682
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Liu Chao.

683
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Liu Chao.

684
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,340
Liu Chao.

685
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,340
Liu Chao.

686
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
Liu Chao.

687
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,340
Liu Chao.

688
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,340
Liu Chao.

689
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Liu Chao.

690
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,340
Liu Chao.

691
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
Liu Chao.

692
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Liu Chao.

693
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,340
Liu Chao.

694
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,340
Liu Chao.

695
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,340
Liu Chao.

696
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Liu Chao.

697
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Liu Chao.

698
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Liu Chao.

699
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
Liu Chao.

700
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Liu Chao.

701
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
Liu Chao.

702
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Liu Chao.

703
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Liu Chao.

704
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,340
Liu Chao.

705
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Liu Chao.

706
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Liu Chao.

707
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Liu Chao.

708
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Liu Chao.

709
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Liu Chao.

710
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Liu Chao.

711
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Liu Chao.

712
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Liu Chao.

713
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Liu Chao.

714
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,340
Liu Chao.

715
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Liu Chao.

716
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Liu Chao.

717
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,340
Liu Chao.

718
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
Liu Chao.

719
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
Liu Chao.

720
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Liu Chao.

721
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Liu Chao.

722
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Liu Chao.

723
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Liu Chao.

724
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,340

743
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,340
Liu Chao.

744
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,340
The End
