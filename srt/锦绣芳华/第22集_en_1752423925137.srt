Andrey Filatov

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Quite aware of yourself.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,400
By our very own freedom and grandchildren

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,400
The Soviet Union was the only living space

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:26,400
The grand header

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
The music is getting dark.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
It's going to snow soon.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
We have to go back early.

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Madam.

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I'll wait for you in the yard.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Go back quickly.

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Yes.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Be careful.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Come on.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Come on.

33
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Come on.

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Come on.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Come on.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Come on.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Who sent you?

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
You're blaming me on purpose.

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
What do you want?

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
How do you know?

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
The one who made the deal

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
doesn't steal my money.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Why did you steal my name?

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
You know the person who came.

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Why did you let your guard chase you?

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Your target is me.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
If you fail,

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
you'll have a second chance.

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
You're smart.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
It's a pity.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
If you don't want to die,

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
just follow us.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Go.

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Go.

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Guards.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Is your master's surname Liu?

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Or...

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,400
How dare you threaten the court officer

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
with a scar?

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I should have known it.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
It's Du Xianling.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Tell me.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Where did you hide the stolen item?

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I didn't steal it.

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
I just wanted to show you.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I can't tell you.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm afraid that

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
you won't know the truth

69
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
if I tell you now.

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Why don't you let me

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
take you there in person?

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Stop playing tricks.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
You tell me yourself

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
and I tell you everything.

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
You'll have more holes.

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm afraid that

77
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I'll die faster if I tell you now.

78
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Guards.

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Du Xianling is a very important person

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
for you.

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
How much is it? I can give you a little bit.

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
We have rules in this business.

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
If you don't talk, I'll tell you.

84
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Maybe you'll be less punished.

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
But you're doing this for money.

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,400
You took my money and told the Emperor that I'm no longer here.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I won't show up again.

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
What do you think?

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Tao, Chief Gu won't cover it up.

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's just...

91
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
You can't do it!

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Go!

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Open the door!

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Over there!

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Open the door!

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Open the door!

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Open the door!

98
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Open the door!

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Open the door!

100
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Open the door!

101
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Open the door!

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Open the door!

103
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
It's not easy to meet again.

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,400
The first thing you did was to kill your own husband.

105
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
You were so cruel.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
It's been a long time since we last met.

107
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
You're so good at fighting.

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
You're more like a fish.

109
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Jiang Zhang Yang, you're not dead.

110
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm not dreaming.

111
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Yes, I'm not dead.

112
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
The End

113
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Let's go.

114
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Let's go home.

115
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Let's go.

116
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Let's go.

117
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Let's go.

118
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I told him I had a secret place that I've been looking for.

119
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm the only one who knows where they are.

120
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
You didn't lie to him.

121
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Xing is really capable of doing things.

122
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
The red-legged Xing is the one I called.

123
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Wherever the secret place is,

124
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
you can see it as long as you look up.

125
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
You'll know when you see it.

126
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm still alive.

127
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You're playing tricks on me.

128
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
How can he tolerate it?

129
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Did they torture you?

130
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,400
A-Ci, beat me a little.

131
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm fine.

132
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
No problem.

133
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm fine.

134
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
A few days later,

135
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
the third man found a way to get to the palace.

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,400
The fish took advantage of the crowd and sneaked into the palace.

137
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
They saved me.

138
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I took my men to the back of the car.

139
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
I went to the east of the river.

140
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
I found out that you weren't in the Xiao family.

141
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I came to you.

142
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Was it serious?

143
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
No.

144
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Your chest was pierced.

145
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
You almost died.

146
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
You were beaten.

147
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
If it wasn't serious,

148
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
you would have been in a lot of trouble.

149
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,400
You were in the river for days.

150
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
And now you're here.

151
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I can't hide anything from you.

152
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Let me see your wound.

153
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
It's been a long time.

154
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
It's not good to be so generous.

155
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Listen to me.

156
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Let me see.

157
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Then I can be at ease.

158
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
It's all over.

159
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
It's not the same.

160
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I miss you.

161
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I miss our reunion.

162
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I can't love you at all.

163
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
But you...

164
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
saw me get married.

165
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,400
You must be very sad.

166
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
It's not important what happened in the past.

167
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
The most important thing is the future.

168
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,400
We should never be apart.

169
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Jiang Changyang, don't worry.

170
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I will protect you.

171
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I will.

172
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I will protect you.

173
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I'm not married now.

174
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I have a bunch of secret guards.

175
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I'll rely on my wife.

176
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
The moon is in the sky.

177
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
And my moon is right beside me.

178
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It's so lucky.

179
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,400
The moon is in the sky.

180
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
And my moon is right beside me.

181
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
It's so lucky.

182
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
The moon is in the sky.

183
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
And my moon is right beside me.

184
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,400
It's so lucky.

185
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,400
The moon is in the sky.

186
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
And my moon is right beside me.

187
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It's so lucky.

188
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
The moon is in the sky.

189
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
And my moon is right beside me.

190
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
It's so lucky.

191
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
The moon is in the sky.

192
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
And my moon is right beside me.

193
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Prince Ning sent people to search.

194
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
In order to keep him from finding me in the east,

195
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I've already divided my men into several groups.

196
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Each group has one person disguised as me.

197
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
They want to seal the secret guard who is friends with Prince Ning.

198
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You want to distract Prince Ning's attention

199
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
and make him suspect the allies?

200
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
This is one of them.

201
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I've been finding out many unspeakable secrets

202
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
from secret guards in recent years.

203
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
They are all friends with Prince Ning.

204
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm not afraid of any difference.

205
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Me and my father are not afraid of any difference.

206
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
These evidences have caused the Shuo and the other parties to create chaos.

207
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
When they are fighting,

208
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
they can't send troops to help Prince Ning.

209
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
No wonder my father always praises you.

210
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
So, this is a miracle.

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
General, besides the military books,

212
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
you should read the other books.

213
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
General, Master Feng wants to see you.

214
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Hurry up.

215
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
General Yu.

216
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
The goods have been sent to the warehouse.

217
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
It's getting cold in winter.

218
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
What else do you need?

219
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Tell me as soon as possible.

220
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
I can use it again before the river is frozen.

221
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
On the day of the escape,

222
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
he sent someone to Prince Ning's military base

223
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
and recorded all the inventory.

224
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I've made a list of Prince Ning's military power.

225
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
There are some rare items on it.

226
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Thank you, Madam.

227
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Don't worry, General.

228
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I'll get them all for you.

229
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Master, it's time to eat.

230
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
It's been a few days.

231
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Why are you still staring at me?

232
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:31,580
We used to fight in the

233
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Epoch Times.

234
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
But this time,

235
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,580
he fought for the husband,

236
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
but I failed to protect Madam.

237
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Please punish me.

238
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Get up.

239
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
We all have different lives.

240
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I never wanted you to fight for your life

241
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
in order to save someone.

242
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Get up.

243
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
You're my sister-in-law now.

244
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
You're also the daughter of Jiangchang.

245
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Don't say such rude things.

246
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Come on, sit down.

247
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Mudan is right.

248
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
I heard that you

249
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
didn't marry Da Fu

250
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
because of my funeral.

251
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
When everything is settled,

252
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
go back to Chang'an

253
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
and propose to Madam Sun.

254
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
It's too cold.

255
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I'll warm it up for you.

256
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Take this

257
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
and use it as firewood.

258
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Let's go.

259
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Don't try to fool me.

260
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
The name you gave me

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
is too bad.

262
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Do you know?

263
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
In my dream,

264
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
you told me the same thing.

265
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I was so happy.

266
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
You told me the same thing.

267
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Did I enter your dream?

268
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
What else did I say in my dream?

269
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
You're just like now.

270
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
You're so rude.

271
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
You always say something I don't like

272
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
and make me angry.

273
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Where are they?

274
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I went to the warehouse

275
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
to deliver the goods.

276
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I didn't see the shopkeeper.

277
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I heard that she came back

278
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
and she cried.

279
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Then she went back to the room.

280
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
She didn't come out.

281
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Thank you.

282
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
The contract

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
made me sad.

284
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Let's go.

285
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Every time I dream you,

286
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
you always say

287
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I should forget you.

288
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I said, okay.

289
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I can forget you.

290
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
But you have to forget me.

291
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Because

292
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
you're in my heart.

293
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Only when you forget me,

294
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I can forget you.

295
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Every time I wake up,

296
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I think it's your dream.

297
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Otherwise, you in the dream

298
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
are like you in the dream.

299
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
You're so tired.

300
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Wu Dan,

301
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
these months,

302
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Da Fu and Xiao Chun

303
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
don't talk to you.

304
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Jiang Chang Yang,

305
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
you talk too much.

306
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
No, I don't.

307
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
When I'm in a coma,

308
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
you're in my dream.

309
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
You talk to me in a boring way.

310
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang.

311
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
I have something to ask you.

312
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Why did you lie to me about the jade book?

313
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Xiao Yu told me about it.

314
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
It's not from her.

315
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I know it.

316
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Wu Dan!

317
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Da Fu, Xiao Chun, don't be afraid.

318
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
It's hard to explain.

319
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
In a word,

320
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Jiang Chang Yang is alive.

321
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
He's back.

322
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I have a shadow.

323
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
He's alive.

324
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
You're alive.

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
You're alive.

326
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Great!

327
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Do you know, Chuan Yu?

328
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
If he wins the prize,

329
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
he'll be so happy.

330
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I know.

331
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I know.

332
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
But Jiang Jun looks fine.

333
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
But he's not fully recovered.

334
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Come on.

335
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
No, no.

336
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I'm just a passerby.

337
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
You've been hiding your sorrow from me.

338
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Da Fu, please hold him.

339
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Xiao Chun, take him.

340
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Da Fu.

341
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I'll help you.

342
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Chuan Yu, you...

343
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Help your husband.

344
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Da Fu.

345
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
It's almost the winter.

346
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
There are many things to do in the army.

347
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
I decided to stop for a year.

348
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
When the new enemy is eliminated,

349
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll finish it.

350
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
The beginning of the winter

351
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
is the beginning of the winter

352
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
when Wei Zhang and the Eastern Army

353
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
were fighting to protect the border.

354
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Now the general has been away for a year.

355
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
He's been away for half a year.

356
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
His father is dead.

357
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
He's been away for a year.

358
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
His father never cared about the people.

359
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
As long as the people of He Dong are safe and sound,

360
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
it's fine.

361
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
The people don't know the danger of the court.

362
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
The general is well-known.

363
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
The winter is over.

364
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm afraid people will be worried.

365
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Besides,

366
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
when the He Dong army was sent back to the border,

367
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
Prince Ni sent a spy to monitor.

368
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Now the people are hiding in the city.

369
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
If the He Dong army is moved,

370
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Prince Ning will be suspicious.

371
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
You're right.

372
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Everything will be fine on the winter.

373
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
The Winter Palace

374
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
The Winter Palace

375
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

376
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
today is the winter festival.

377
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I'd like to wish you all good luck.

378
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Let's drink to it.

379
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Good!

380
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Come on, drink.

381
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Drink.

382
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Good!

383
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Good!

384
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Good!

385
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Good!

386
00:28:48,400 --> 00:29:01,580
We

387
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Come on, come on!

388
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Yunniang sent a letter.

389
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Everything is fine in Chang'an.

390
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Li Xin has changed.

391
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
She is now in the court.

392
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
She is now a good girl.

393
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
She is no longer hard to deal with.

394
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,580
My cousin is lucky to be beaten.

395
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Otherwise, he would not escape.

396
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Zhang Changyang, do you think that

397
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,580
there are too many lights in the city tonight?

398
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
It's winter.

399
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
People will light up all the lights in the house.

400
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,580
The lights in the house are bright and bright.

401
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,580
It's a memorial to the soldiers who died in the battle.

402
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,580
I don't know how long this peace will last.

403
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
If the war is still going on,

404
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
I hope it won't affect the people.

405
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,580
The Hedong Army is like a stronghold.

406
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,580
The people of Hedong are united.

407
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
We will not let the king's ambitions be achieved

408
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
if we take over the territory.

409
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
I will help you.

410
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
The day will come.

411
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Let's enjoy the beautiful scenery tonight.

412
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Let's go!

413
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Don't be afraid.

414
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Do you want to be my friend?

415
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Friend?

416
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,580
Do you want to be my friend?

417
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I'll take one.

418
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,580
Please, take us.

419
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Keep watching.

420
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
I'm fine.

421
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
This mask is heavy.

422
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Look, I'm done.

423
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
For you.

424
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
Thank you.

425
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Thank you.

426
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
See you.

427
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,660
No one here can take off their masks.

428
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,580
See you.

429
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Close the door and windows.

430
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Fire and fire.

431
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Close the door and windows.

432
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,900
Fire and fire.

433
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
I wish I could walk with you like this.

434
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
But I have to go.

435
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,580
With this, we can't enter.

436
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
But you have to go back to Jizhou tomorrow.

437
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,580
It's not clear if you will be tired.

438
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
It's rare.

439
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
And it's a long way.

440
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
I can take a break in the car.

441
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Okay.

442
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
The night is new.

443
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Enjoy the moonlight.

444
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
It's not easy to have fun.

445
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Jiang Changyang still went to He Dong.

446
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,580
He provoked the internal chaos between Shuo Fang and Fan Ying.

447
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,580
It seems that he and Yu Zheng are going to fight me to the death.

448
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Now the military force of He Dong is in the hands of the people.

449
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Now the military force of He Dong is not small.

450
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,580
You should make a decision soon.

451
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,580
Fan Ying and Shuo Fang are closer to He Dong.

452
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,580
But they don't have enough troops.

453
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,580
It's time to use the Xiao's army.

454
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
Only He Xi sent troops.

455
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
I'm afraid he won't make it.

456
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,580
Jiannan is far away.

457
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,580
But his army is not in the hands of the king.

458
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,580
I can't give him a chance to make a contribution.

459
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Okay.

460
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Send a message.

461
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Don't wait.

462
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,580
The last battle is about to end.

463
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Yes.

464
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,580
The military force of He Dong is here.

465
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,580
He Dong army is against the rebellion.

466
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Please make a decision soon.

467
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,580
Your Majesty, I will fight with the army.

468
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,580
I will not let the bandits go.

469
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,580
I will not let the bandits go.

470
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,580
I will go with you to the battlefield.

471
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Please allow me.

472
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,580
You are the leader of the army.

473
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:23,580
General, I'm waiting for you to make a choice in Chang'an.

474
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,580
I will not let you down.

475
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
This is a fire.

476
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,580
4,000 fish are enough to fight the 50 barrels of fire.

477
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
General, look.

478
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
This is a good job.

479
00:36:51,580 --> 00:37:03,780
The money is from the

480
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,780
General, you are welcome.

481
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
This year is a rainy spring.

482
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,780
The fire is not enough.

483
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,580
We need to use charcoal to burn the remains.

484
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Okay.

485
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,580
The king of the Ming is out.

486
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Be careful on the battlefield.

487
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,580
Don't worry.

488
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
I will protect myself.

489
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,580
This is a close battle.

490
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Your martial arts are good, but don't be strong.

491
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,580
I will get married when I come back.

492
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,580
If we don't make a choice,

493
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
take me to the Star Tower.

494
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Stop talking nonsense.

495
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,580
This is a mother's gift.

496
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Don't hurt yourself.

497
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
You are still playing.

498
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
You dare to try again.

499
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,580
I know.

500
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
You used to play everything,

501
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
but you were not born.

502
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Now you have me.

503
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,580
You should be born and afraid of death.

504
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,580
I am the only one who knows me.

505
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
I am leaving.

506
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Go.

507
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Go.

508
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,860
Pre fuerus

509
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Prefusınız

510
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:46,860
The Central Army, the Western Army and the South Army

511
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,580
are running away from the enemy.

512
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,780
They are running away from the enemy.

513
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,220
They are running away from the enemy.

514
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,540
They are running away from the enemy.

515
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,660
What a thief!

516
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,660
What a thief!

517
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,460
The Hedong Army has been defending the border for many years.

518
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,900
The Hedong Army has been defending the border for many years.

519
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,020
The Central Army is defending the country.

520
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,020
The Central Army is defending the country.

521
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,620
They never want to rebel.

522
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,020
They never want to rebel.

523
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,020
Today, I swear to the country.

524
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,740
Today, I swear to the country.

525
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,540
I will never bow to the enemy.

526
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,940
I will never bow to the enemy.

527
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
Good.

528
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,060
Hoorah!

529
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,260
Attack!

530
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
Fire!

531
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
Fire!

532
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Fire!

533
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,460
Fire!

534
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,460
Fire!

535
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,460
Fire!

536
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,460
Fire!

537
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,460
Fire!

538
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
The End
