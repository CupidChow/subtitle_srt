my special guest

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,800
Heaven is hell

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will accept your daughter as my wife.

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
She is the biggest shame I have ever suffered.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Today you are going to the Fuyun Temple to pray.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If your heart fails,

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the prayer will not work.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Young Mistress, remember,

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the nobility has five hours.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can't get up until the time comes.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How dare you, the emperor,

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
dare to play tricks in the Angel's Palace?

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The god of fortune is the key.

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please forgive me.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The nobility has five hours.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You must not find out

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that we gave you the test.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If I had found out

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that the Purple-Square is fake,

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
my father would not have left me.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My lady, you can't stay here.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me go.

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Get out of the way.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't die.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Someone is going to kill us.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Someone is going to kill us.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Shilong,

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
let's go home.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go home.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I never care about Liu Chang.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If I want to play chess,

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I must cut the horse quickly.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please, everyone,

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
do me a favor.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please,

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
let's divorce.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We are happy to part.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think it's a good deal.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's over.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can go.

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My lady,

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've never been your enemy.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is a way to win.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm just a woman

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
who wants to hold her own life.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But she's too ungrateful

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to take away the dowry

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and to cause trouble to the court.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She's going to ruin the reputation of the Liu family.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
She can't stay.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Tao's night run

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is really unbearable.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will definitely make a fortune in Chang'an

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and take back the court

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
with my hands.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Stop.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Go back to the room.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Pomegranate seed?

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't you want the grain?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The Yamen is really owned by the Ming family.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
General's means and speed

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
are very admirable.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Jiang Xiaohua,

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
are you satisfied?

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All the goods are on the shelf.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The flowers are blooming.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The prize is registered here.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The three of us will buy it.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll buy it.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The moon is full of new talents.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The moon is fragrant.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The moon is fragrant.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The moon is fragrant.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The moon is fragrant.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The moon is fragrant.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The moon is fragrant.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Take your hand.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want the same moon and the same day to be born.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want the same moon and the same day to be born.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want the same moon and the same day to be born.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But my room

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
is not in the backyard of the Jiang's mansion.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
My room is in the backyard of the Jiang's mansion.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I gave you money to do business.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now you haven't earned a penny.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You've changed your mind.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The flowers are full.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The big show begins.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Our bookshelves are made of medicine.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's good for your health.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We have everything you need.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Xiao Changyang,

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
when you were with the kids,

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you were not like a visitant.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tell me

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what kind of man you like.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I hope this man

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
can know me better than I do.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Even if I don't say anything,

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
he knows all my happiness,

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
decisions and dreams.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No matter what kind of decisions I make,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
he can face them with me.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There are many nights in life.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Only the moon can't be separated.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Today I met him.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No matter where you are,

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not alone.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wipe your mouth first.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're a bastard!

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're a bastard!

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why did you become a bastard?

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're a bastard!

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why did you become a bastard?

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where is Mudan?

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mudan treats you so well.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why did you betray him?

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't betray him.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I wish Ningfu to break her promise.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to be with you forever.

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
From now on,

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
we're not related.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you're not well,

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
come back.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I hope you'll be a good friend

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and never meet

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
someone like me.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Shanyi!

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shanyi!

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Shanyi!

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now,

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yulu,

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you've seen

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
the truth.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yulu,

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
have you seen it?

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Master!

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The clothes are full of flowers.

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They are very beautiful.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Master,

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I invite you to wear these things

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and go to the Star Palace

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to try them on.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're just a maid.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're so stubborn.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You don't care about our friendship.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now,

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you should care about Zishu.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I married He Weifeng

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and I've broken Zishu's heart.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I've helped you to get rid of your worries.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now,

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
all the people are in need.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I should be the one to recommend the best.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was going to ask His Majesty

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to help me pick one,

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but now I have no one to help me.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm afraid I'll lose my reward.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm doing this

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to save you.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm afraid I'll never have a son again.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're going to marry him?

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're not going to marry him?

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you really don't mind my poor body,

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'd like to marry you.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We'll be together forever.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've been in Luoyang for a long time.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I feel the sense ofangeness.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
After all, this is the place to talent.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm raving here.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I came here to enjoy my loved ones.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Parade has quite便call 스ите

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because wine drink with the folks.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Today is the start.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is for you, Madam Tang.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is for me.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Everyone has it.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How much did you pay?

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
More than you.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Everyone, our business is booming.

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thank you for your hard work.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Today, the restaurant is open.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can go to the restaurant.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hello.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Hello.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Today, we have enough meat and wine.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Everyone will be happy.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Bye.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you.

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
One more.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sister, drink a little.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You work hard at night.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You shouldn't drink too much.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll drink this tea.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Your sister likes drinking.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Today is a happy day.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Drink less.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It doesn't matter.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Come on.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Come on.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It smells good.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is Liulang's cake, right?

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll try it.

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Liulang's cooking is very good.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Liulang, make more.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let everyone taste it.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

224
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You are getting better at coaxing children.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It seems that Wu Bo'en didn't go for nothing.

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't coax him.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Liulang's cooking is getting better.

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
By the way, I want to invite a master in the mountain area to give me a tip.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He will make a cake with flowers and sell it.

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I want to taste it.

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Leave some for everyone.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can eat it in the next episode.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I have to wait for more time for the next episode.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can eat one.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's really good.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Everyone, eat it.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Drink it.

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Eat.

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Come on.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's eat.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's delicious.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's delicious.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's delicious.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's delicious.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I have something to tell everyone.

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm afraid that I will be left out.

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can leave first.

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Everyone is watching.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not good for me to leave everything behind.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Come on, everyone, let's drink.

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are here, everyone is watching.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Go.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You can talk.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will leave first.

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can drink.

257
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But don't get drunk.

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Drunkness can hurt your body.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will feel bad.

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I know.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's go.

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go.

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's go.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Everyone, let's drink again.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on.

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Come on.

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Drink again.

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Drunkness is not a problem.

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Drunkness is not a problem.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The owner of the shop is staying with us.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you have any orders?

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Jinniang, this is yours.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Here, the rules.

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Tao, this is yours.

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In the past few months, everyone has been doing their best.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can see it.

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I went to the government office the other day.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have already set the bar for you.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The owner of the shop is so kind to us.

282
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How can we repay him?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you doing?

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Get up, get up.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We are a family.

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why are you talking about kindness?

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's go!

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Please.

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Please come!

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:16:01,720
是放了

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,400
What nonsense? I've never seen it.

321
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,520
Since you didn't steal it,

322
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,240
did Mudan steal it and hide it with you?

323
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
Bullshit!

324
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,720
Anyway, it's either you or him.

325
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,640
Or you two conspired together.

326
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
Go, call Jiang Lang here.

327
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,640
Let him see clearly

328
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,920
what kind of person is sleeping next to him.

329
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,040
Yes.

330
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,800
I was bestowed by His Majesty to Jiang Lang.

331
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Now the atmosphere in the mansion is not good.

332
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,120
I should take care of it for His Majesty.

333
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,160
You're obviously trying to frame me.

334
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
You don't believe me?

335
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,920
You're a dirty person.

336
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,840
You don't know how to repent and you still dare to slander me.

337
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
You should be punished

338
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,800
for slandering me.

339
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,240
Yes.

340
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,960
I didn't.

341
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,920
Let me go!

342
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Let me go!

343
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
Let me go!

344
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,560
Don't touch me!

345
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Let me go!

346
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Let me go!

347
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm going to punish you for what you did.

348
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,120
If you want to do something, you can slander me.

349
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,240
If you dare to slander Mudan again,

350
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm not the only one who's been killed in this house.

351
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
You should see it for yourself.

352
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,520
Stop it!

353
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,400
Jiang Lang!

354
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,840
Jiang Lang, you're finally here.

355
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,680
When the man stole my jewelry,

356
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I just asked around

357
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,440
and he started to hurt people.

358
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
Lian Zhou is so cruel.

359
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I'm scared.

360
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm not!

361
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,360
You're talking nonsense!

362
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,920
You're...

363
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,520
Madam!

364
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
That's the way it is.

365
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,040
Jiang Jun,

366
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,040
you don't believe Lian Zhou, do you?

367
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Lian Zhou...

368
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,320
Of course not.

369
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,160
It's just that you're in trouble

370
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
because of me.

371
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,160
It's really...

372
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
It's okay.

373
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just a mouthful.

374
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,560
Sit down first.

375
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
It's okay.

376
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,200
As long as Jiang Jun believes in Mudan,

377
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm relieved.

378
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,520
If you don't believe me...

379
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
Sit down.

380
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,520
Can you love yourself first?

381
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,360
A mother who has a father who is a father.

382
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,320
If your mother finds out,

383
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,520
she'll be so sad.

384
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,960
That's right.

385
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,480
Before I get better,

386
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll hide in Mudan.

387
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,040
Be a good boy.

388
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Chuan Yu is so nice to you.

389
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,360
She doesn't care about her master.

390
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm not hurt

391
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,320
because of your words.

392
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
A man's injury

393
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
should be treated by a brave man.

394
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Da Fu!

395
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,600
Da Fu!

396
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,280
Mudan!

397
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Da Fu, let me see where you got hurt.

398
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,440
Here.

399
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,760
I didn't come here on purpose.

400
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,720
Will you leave me?

401
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,680
It's okay.

402
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
You're a man of your word.

403
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
Jiang Jun has been looking for someone

404
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
and used the medicine given by the jade.

405
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,920
Don't worry.

406
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,280
You're hurt so much.

407
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
You can still smile.

408
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,280
A little.

409
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
The reason for the incident

410
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
has been told by you

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
when you came here.

412
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Don't worry.

413
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,520
Chuan Yu is almost recovered.

414
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Go and see Jiang Jun.

415
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
He's hurt too.

416
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,360
Your waist

417
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
was also injured by Lian Zhou?

418
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,440
No.

419
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,280
It has nothing to do with the gold.

420
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
Chuan Yu,

421
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,680
help me to talk to Da Fu.

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Husband,

423
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,080
come with me.

424
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,940
You have to remember

425
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,040
that it's not me who butted you into this picture.

426
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,280
This man still loves you.

427
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,400
Uncle Mai,

428
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,520
don't scold me like that.

429
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,840
What I'm doing is not your fault.

430
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,320
Get this straight.

431
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,320
What can I say?

432
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,640
You don't understand too well.

433
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,440
т

434
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,640
Let me see.

435
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,540
Mum,

436
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,100
But it has nothing to do with Da Fu.

437
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,380
Now Lian Zhong is slandering and punishing Da Fu.

438
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900
I must get justice for Da Fu.

439
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,100
If you want to stop him...

440
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,300
Why should I stop him?

441
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,100
If you need me to do something,

442
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,580
just mention it.

443
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
No need.

444
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,180
Thank you.

445
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,100
You got this waist injury when I came back?

446
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,540
You remember that night?

447
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,780
I was drunk, not dead.

448
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,980
Of course I remember.

449
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,100
I just drank too much.

450
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,900
Just a little.

451
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,500
That's fine.

452
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,140
You'll pay for the waist injury.

453
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,540
You gave me all you got.

454
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,100
I need now some moreience.

455
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,060
I'm off now.

456
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,540
no, look, have something to eat.

457
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:36,820
I lost all the days of geçi

458
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
communication of a good company in our country

459
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,740
I'll go home early for this dinner,

460
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,060
Come on, why needってる,

461
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,700
You don't remember the last time you met him.

462
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Yes.

463
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
You Yi, untie the pillow!

464
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,060
Madam, the pillow is strange.

465
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,300
I heard He Weifang knows some medicine.

466
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Maybe he's the one who did it.

467
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,780
Madam, when the husband comes,

468
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
you must let him help you.

469
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,460
What time is it?

470
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
It's past midnight.

471
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,460
If Jiang Lang sees me like this,

472
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
how can I get the favor?

473
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,580
Tell him that I'm very happy to see him.

474
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,620
But I'm afraid that I'll get sick

475
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
and I'm afraid that I'll give him the sickly.

476
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Please don't visit him.

477
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
When I'm fully recovered,

478
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I'll ask for his forgiveness.

479
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Yes.

480
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
What are you going to do?

481
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
I've asked a few doctors.

482
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
They said that the disease is unknown.

483
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
They can't give him the medicine.

484
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
What can I do?

485
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
I'm afraid it's too much for you.

486
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
What's the point of stealing for the first time?

487
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,460
As long as I can make sure that I'm fully recovered,

488
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,460
I'll have a chance to deal with him.

489
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Sister Mudan,

490
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
can I come out to see you?

491
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Sister Mudan!

492
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
What's the matter, Mrs. Lian Zhou?

493
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
I took a bath last night.

494
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
I don't know why,

495
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,380
but my body is full of dandruff.

496
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
I know that Mudan is in pain.

497
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Can you help me?

498
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,380
What a coincidence!

499
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
I heard that Da Fu stole your jewelry.

500
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
Now I'm investigating.

501
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,380
I can't get it without a match.

502
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
What?

503
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Although I broke a leg,

504
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
I will not let you get away with it.

505
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
I'm so tired.

506
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Mudan?

507
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Alien?

508
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Why are you again?

509
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
The power outage is over.

510
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Alien!

511
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Power outage is over.

512
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
The power outage is over.

513
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,140
Alien!

514
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Power outage is over.

515
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Alien!

516
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,060
Alien gives only 100% of electrons.

517
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:06,980
消毒及衛生精 高標準 放心用 滔滔養眠天山白 要您繼續觀看

518
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,440
此事是我弄錯了 諸夫娘子 並未偷竭

519
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,780
既然如此 那是夫人冤枉了大夫

520
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,160
那大夫脖子上的傷和所受的委屈 夫人應當如何彌補呢

521
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,160
I will explain to the servants and clear the name of the concubine.

522
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
This is what you want to do.

523
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
How can you make it up?

524
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
You are slandering yourself and slandering yourself.

525
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
This is what you said before.

526
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Then I will ask Mudan to make a deal with the concubine.

527
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,160
What did you do to make her admit that she is wrong?

528
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Xiaochun developed a beauty pill and took a lot of flower petals.

529
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,160
I found that the juice of the flower can make the skin healthy.

530
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,160
Although there is no danger of life, it can cause damage to the face and make it rotten.

531
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,160
So I took some and put it in her bucket.

532
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Stealing is your fault.

533
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Now you are committing suicide.

534
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,160
You need to write a letter and put it in the court.

535
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
And apologize to the court.

536
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Okay, I will write it right away.

537
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Can you explain it to me?

538
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I don't know your past, but I can probably see it.

539
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,160
You can't afford to get married.

540
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,160
You must have your own grievances and difficulties.

541
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
So you can do whatever you want.

542
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,160
It's normal to be loyal to your family.

543
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
I can understand.

544
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
I am a woman.

545
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,160
I don't want to argue with you.

546
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,160
If you don't hurt my friends and relatives,

547
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,160
we can still be as peaceful as before.

548
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:32,160
You don't care about Jiang Lang's favor?

549
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I mean, I have a mutual love with Suizhi.

550
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't need to argue with you.

551
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
You...

552
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Don't be angry for a man who doesn't love you.

553
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,160
The more you love him, the more you can't get rid of your disease.

554
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I am a good person.

555
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
You are a good person.

556
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I am a good person.

557
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I am a good person.

558
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I am a good person.

559
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I am a good person.

560
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
You are a good person.

561
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
We are not easy women.

562
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Why do we have to play tricks on each other?

563
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Lian Zhou is the adopted daughter of Prince Ning.

564
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Besides beauty, there must be other things.

565
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Besides asking for your husband's approval,

566
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,160
there is nothing else you like to do?

567
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,160
I have many talented women here.

568
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
They have already left the house.

569
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Now they are sewing,

570
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
making flowers,

571
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
making incense,

572
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
dressing up.

573
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
They are all enjoying themselves.

574
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,160
If you are interested in picking flowers and plants,

575
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,160
you can come to my garden in the future.

576
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You want me to plant flowers and do business with you?

577
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Is there anything wrong with doing business?

578
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
You are so strange.

579
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
You married a flower and bird,

580
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,160
but you still earn that little money.

581
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't understand.

582
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Why does Jiang Meng have a heart

583
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
that is all on someone like you?

584
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
What's wrong with making money?

585
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Who can't get along with money?

586
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Besides, my husband likes me for having this ability.

587
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Don't be so impulsive.

588
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,160
You can recover in three days.

589
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Think about what I told you today.

590
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,160
If you think it through, you can come to me anytime.

591
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I don't understand.

592
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Why does Jiang Meng have a heart

593
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
that is all on someone like you?

594
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
It must be because we are too real.

595
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,160
That's why Lian Zhou said that.

596
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Yellow-Turquoise!

597
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Oh, no!

598
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Brother Yang, a toast to you.

599
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,160
They say that the new leader is strict in his attitude.

600
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
You should drink less.

601
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
If you work tomorrow and drink,

602
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
you will be punished.

603
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm not a hard worker.

604
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Liu Chang is strict in his attitude.

605
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
He doesn't show any affection.

606
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,160
He doesn't care about us.

607
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Liu Chang is a fast-witted man.

608
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
He is a man of honor.

609
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
He is a gentle man.

610
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
What can he do?

611
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
He is a man of high spirits.

612
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,160
He is good at building the dock and the ship.

613
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I think if he didn't show his attitude to Prince Ning,

614
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
he wouldn't have given up.

615
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Brother Zi Shu is so capable.

616
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Does he want to show his attitude?

617
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Or...

618
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
He should show his attitude.

619
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,160
But he should show his attitude.

620
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Otherwise, the county has no respect for him.

621
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,160
He can't afford to depend on Liu Chang.

622
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I have a grudge against him.

623
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
He is so diligent.

624
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,160
I think he has been working for a year.

625
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,160
You are so talented.

626
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Why don't you come to my house tomorrow?

627
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
You can talk with me.

628
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm honored.

629
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,160
I think you look better with your waist.

630
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,160
The beauty of the thin jade is the most beautiful.

631
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Thank you, General.

632
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Wait, General.

633
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,160
You promised to give me a bracelet.

634
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
You can't be biased.

635
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Good!

636
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Good!

637
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Good!

638
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
It's late.

639
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Why do you drink?

640
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Why don't you light a few candles?

641
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Why are you so anxious?

642
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,160
You haven't drunk enough.

643
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,160
You don't have to drink so much.

644
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm sure that he didn't see Jiang Cheng's face.

645
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I almost fell into his trap.

646
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Jiang Sui Zhi.

647
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's late. Why don't you go home?

648
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
If you want to drink,

649
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I can accompany you.

650
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
You are busy.

651
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Since you have time to pick me up,

652
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I will accompany you.

653
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,160
You promised to give me a bracelet.

654
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I will accompany you.

655
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Sui Zhi.

656
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,160
I have a new sachet.

657
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I will give it to you.

658
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,160
The rouge is very strong.

659
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,160
You can have it when you go home.

660
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Right?

661
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Goodbye.

662
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
What's going on?

663
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
You promised to save me at 11 o'clock.

664
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
You said you would come at 3 o'clock.

665
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,160
If you go any later, the candles in the house will go out.

666
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,160
I was scared by Lian Zhou.

667
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
She was so nice.

668
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Lian Zhou thought you were very affectionate.

669
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,160
She said a lot of strange things to me.

670
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I should show her

671
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
how you are today.

672
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
She said it as a joke.

673
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
You didn't take it seriously, did you?

674
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Of course not.

675
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Lian Zhou only saw your kindness to me.

676
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
She didn't know that you were nice to me

677
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
because we were close.

678
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
But it's understandable.

679
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
You are my friend.

680
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
I will always be your friend.

681
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
I will always be your friend.

682
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
I will always be your friend.

683
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
But it's understandable.

684
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
You are a high-ranking official.

685
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Why are you so kind to a low-ranking official?

686
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
These years,

687
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,160
I have seen the two of us in the official field.

688
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,160
The two of us are very close.

689
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
It's rare to see you

690
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,160
in such a big place.

691
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
It's worth to meet you.

692
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Are you drunk?

693
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Why are you praising me?

694
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,160
You are so shy.

695
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
You are like this.

696
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
I can hear what others say.

697
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Besides, you are nice to me.

698
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
You said

699
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
that it's hard to find a friend.

700
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
You don't need to say thank you.

701
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,160
It's obvious.

702
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I will never let you down.

703
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
From now on,

704
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,160
you are the most important person to me.

705
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,160
You can say anything you want.

706
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
You are lying.

707
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
We are friends.

708
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm the third in your heart.

709
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Of course, you are more important.

710
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Thank you.

711
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Take this medicine.

712
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
Thanks.

713
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,440
Okay.

714
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,820
Yes,하고.

715
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,200
It may be that way?

716
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,460
What about here?

717
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Yes.

718
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,700
Yes?

719
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,860
What's that?

720
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,340
R cheese.

721
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,060
K?

722
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
I'll teach him a good lesson.

723
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Go and invite the next one.

724
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
Yes.

725
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,060
Father.

726
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
You must remember, Sixth Wolf.

727
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,060
The spring is not yet full, the river is still fresh, the world is a chess piece.

728
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,060
I used to teach your sister the same way.

729
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
Yes.

730
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,060
You got it wrong again.

731
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Look, you must hold the pen like this.

732
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,060
The letters you write will be out of the envelope.

733
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
See?

734
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
Try again.

735
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Yes, yes.

736
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
These two are together, this one goes back.

737
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Okay, try it now.

738
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Find this feeling.

739
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Not bad.

740
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,060
Yes.

741
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Go down.

742
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Wudan.

743
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Why are you here at this hour?

744
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,060
You're here again.

745
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
Go on.

746
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
You helped Shu Fei to recuperate for a few months, he got much better.

747
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060
Before returning to the palace, he asked me to teach you this painting.

748
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
He said he would like to thank you for your company during this time.

749
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
Those medicine boxes and things,

750
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,060
it's not like he didn't pay me.

751
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,060
Why is Shu Fei so polite?

752
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
You often test horses with Shu Fei.

753
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
You must be getting better.

754
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Of course.

755
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,060
Will you dare to compete with me in the future?

756
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
You talk so much.

757
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
Will you dare to bet on me?

758
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
You still have a lot of money from me.

759
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
You still want to make a bet on me, don't you?

760
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,060
You're so lucky.

761
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Shu Fei has been raising you for many years.

762
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
You have a good life, why are you afraid of losing?

763
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Shu Fei has never been so kind to me because of his high rank.

764
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
He treats me so well.

765
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
He's back in the palace, he's not as free as in another palace.

766
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Can you talk to him?

767
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Even if you can't visit him often,

768
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
at least let him see his child more often.

769
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
Don't worry.

770
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Shu Fei has been away from the palace for a long time.

771
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,060
He's very considerate.

772
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
He will treat him well.

773
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Sister, I wrote another word.

774
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Is it right?

775
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,060
I've never taught you this word.

776
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
How did you know?

777
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,060
I read the square and the square.

778
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
I've been thinking about it.

779
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
I know it.

780
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
You're so smart.

781
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
If so,

782
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,060
I'll teach you another word.

783
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
The circle of the square.

784
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Come on.

785
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,060
I'll write the outside.

786
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Try it.

787
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
I'm lucky.

788
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,060
But your sister is busy.

789
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
She can't teach you every day.

790
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
How about I help you to find a private book?

791
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,060
I don't need any other teacher.

792
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,060
I just need my sister to teach me.

793
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
I only like cooking.

794
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,060
I can't read.

795
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
I can't do it.

796
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I'm not an official.

797
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,060
I'm not a good cook.

798
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
If you like cooking,

799
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,060
I can hire a master in a restaurant.

800
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
You can learn from him.

801
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
You can open a restaurant and be the owner.

802
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
I heard that Mr. Xue from the rich house

803
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
is going to take over this year.

804
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,060
Really?

805
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,060
That's great.

806
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
You know him well.

807
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Can you introduce me to him?

808
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,060
I can take him to visit.

809
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
No problem.

810
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Sister, I heard that

811
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,480
the flower shop likes to make flowers for the beauty of the

812
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Huan Yun House.

813
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Can you ask the flower shop to make a flower for you and me?

814
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
You should invite me to make flowers.

815
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,480
You should invite me to your show.

816
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
You are not a good person.

817
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
You don't deserve to be the flower shop's guest.

818
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm asking you to come.

819
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Liu Lang,

820
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
you should know that

821
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
no matter what you want,

822
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
you can't say it with your own mouth.

823
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Do you understand?

824
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,900
Liu Lang has been taught.

825
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Today is a free day.

826
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
I'm in a good mood.

827
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
I'm going to paint a picture.

828
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
This painting is called

829
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,900
Please, Liu Lang, give your husband a picture of love.

830
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,900
Where is Liu Lang?

831
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,900
This is called Liu Bai.

832
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,900
Although there is no him in the painting,

833
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
he is in front of the person in the painting.

834
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
This painting is very good.

835
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,900
In the future, the guests will know

836
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
that we are in love.

837
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,900
Mudan!

838
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,900
Xiaochun is in trouble.
