1
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,999

2
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,360
Your Majesty.

3
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,240
The treasonous rebels are dead.

4
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,640
The loyal and brave Prince Ning has protected me,
and he is a model for all officials.

5
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,839
The court has suffered a great difficulty.

6
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,679
My heart feels as if it's on fire,
and the grief is unbearable.

7
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,360
All remnants of the situation
are to be managed by Prince Ning.

8
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,719
All officials are to obey
his orders without error.

9
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,120
He is already a part of the traitor faction.

10
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,800
If you take another step forward,
you will be guilty of treason. Think carefully.

11
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,319

12
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,119
Hurry.

13
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
Over here.

14
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,480

15
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,639
- Yes.
- What happened to Lady He?

16
00:04:56,636 --> 00:05:01,520

17
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,040
You're awake.

18
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,439
I already have a husband.
Mr. Liu, please behave yourself.

19
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,280
Jiang Chang Yang is already dead.

20
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,879
The concubines of the traitor faction
should be made official servants.

21
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,960
He Wei Fang, only I can help you.

22
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,520
How you live in the future depends on my mood.

23
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:48,480
Listen closely, from today onwards,
you will eat and sleep on this bed.

24
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
I will come to see you every day.

25
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,400
The only ones who can stay together
for a long time are you and I.

26
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,040
You're trapped here,
yet you're still so fierce in temperament.

27
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,720
Don't hurt yourself.

28
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,160
Give it back to me! Give it back!

29
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Mr. Liu.

30
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,920
What is the matter?

31
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,840
His Highness requests your presence.

32
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,439
Our future is long.

33
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,560
Those who bring troops into the city
without orders will be sentenced to death.

34
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,879
Enter the city.

35
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,319
The imperial decree is here,
and you shall obey the orders.

36
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,520
The imperial decree is here. Officers and soldiers
of the Hedong Army shall obey the orders.

37
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,759
The Floral Envoy Jiang Chang Yang colluded
with the Shangfu Local Military Captain

38
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,039
Pei Zhong in plotting treason
and rebellion at the Promotion Feast,

39
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,679
killing the new imperial scholars
and important officials.

40
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,840
Hedong Military Governor Yu Chang killed traitors
and loyally died for the country.

41
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,679
Moved by this, I appoint his son Yu Zheng
to succeed as Commander and grant him a banner.

42
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,159
He is entrusted with military autonomy
for execution. My edict is on the right.

43
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,120
Upon receipt of this order, execute it.

44
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
How did it come to this?

45
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,519
The incident happened suddenly.
His Majesty, like yourself, could not believe it.

46
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,120
New scholar Zhang Qian has survived
and has already given testimony.

47
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,079
If you have any doubts, feel free to ask him.

48
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,719
I accept the decree.

49
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,399
General Yu, the fire scene is in disarray.

50
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:02,079
They only retrieved General Yu's sword and some
bone fragments. I am sorry for your loss.

51
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,880
Thank you.

52
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,679
An army cannot go a day without a general.
You are now the backbone of the Hedong Army.

53
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,840
As for your promotion...

54
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,600
With the passing of my father,
I am in no mood for political affairs.

55
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,679
Now I just want to return
to Hedong and mourn my father.

56
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,519
It is indeed right to be a son first,
then a minister of the court.

57
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,759
Well, then. General, you should
reorganize the troops and rest.

58
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:04,640
At dawn tomorrow, His Majesty
will send people to escort you back to Hedong.

59
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,840
In just a few days, Mr. Liu helped His Highness
turn danger into a great victory.

60
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,559
I truly admire that.

61
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,600
You made a wise choice. Otherwise, you wouldn't
be sitting here drinking tea with me now.

62
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,320
Yes, I agreed to your proposal

63
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
because we were both burdened by family status
and were unrecognized for our talents.

64
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,320
My defection on the battlefield
was not out of fear for my life.

65
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,839
But because I realized that only by following
His Highness could I fulfill my ambitions.

66
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,879
His Majesty already has trusted
and esteemed people around him.

67
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,799
He won't place any heavy trust in you.

68
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,000
You took the Imperial Exam for nine years
and finally succeeded.

69
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,120
If you had to start as a low-ranking official,
how many more nine years do you have?

70
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,079
You know me well. I will not disappoint you
or Prince Ning's esteem and promotion.

71
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,519
I refined my advice for governing the country
after hearing your guidance.

72
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,400
Please present it to Prince Ning on my behalf.

73
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,559
Why?

74
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,559
Once disloyal, never used again.

75
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:07,559
You really are like me, but what I hate most
in my life is who I am.

76
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,799
Issue the order to strengthen vigil
throughout the new residence.

77
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,559
Never give the fleeing remnants
an opportunity to exploit.

78
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,359
Yes.

79
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,679
Your Highness, you have vanquished the enemies.
This victory deserves celebration.

80
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,000
Why hide and lay low now?

81
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,839
Victory? Look at what these people have done.

82
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,129
For over a decade, they have endured hardships.

83
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:14,720
For politics, land, finance, and military,

84
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
they have placed their people in key positions.

85
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,559
If not for the information in advance
and urgent deployment today,

86
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,799
I would have died there in the Fragrance Garden.

87
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,039
Only with evenly matched opponents
does one gain improvement.

88
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,000
Your Highness, you saw the subtle signs
and made resolute decisions.

89
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,280
Even with their meticulous planning,
they still ended up in a deadlock.

90
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,160
Now it's time for Your Highness to make a move.

91
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,799
We've seized power in the capital.

92
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:54,000
However, several military governors
remain stubborn and need to be pacified.

93
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,080
What happened today
will soon spread throughout the nation.

94
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,840
This matter should not be handled by force
but by leveraging power.

95
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,640
Yes.

96
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,519
Yu Zheng, he...

97
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,600
He is disheartened and only wishes to mourn.

98
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,640
His stance is unclear.

99
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,679
Alone, he is not to be feared.

100
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,360
However, the Yu family
still has veteran generals as support.

101
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,400
The Hedong Army is brave and skilled in battle,
loyal to the emperor, and must be guarded against.

102
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Remember, what I need is a mandate from Heaven,
legitimate and justified.

103
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,760
I understand.

104
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,279
A spy has already been placed in the escort fleet
of the Hedong Army.

105
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,479
If the sharp blade can't be used by Your Highness,
it would be better to break it.

106
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:02,400
Once the mission is accomplished,
you will become the only beacon in Chang'an,

107
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,359
Illuminating the world
and bringing eternal prosperity.

108
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,080
It's not a festival,
so why are there so many imperial guards?

109
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,880
I don't know.

110
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,799
Chun.

111
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,559
Father.

112
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,839
Hurry up. Those at the back, hurry up.

113
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,759
Everything was fine when we left.
How could this happen?

114
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,839
When we hurried there, we saw Mr. Jiang
and She Yan being carried out of Fragrance Garden.

115
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,000
The corpses on the ground were unrecognizable.

116
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,519
We couldn't find Mu Dan and Chuan Yu either.

117
00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:00,880
No way. Chuan Yu is so skilled
in martial arts. He wouldn't die.

118
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,599
Mu Dan also said she would wait for us to return.
She wouldn't break her promise.

119
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes.

120
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Maybe they've hidden somewhere. I'll go find them.

121
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
- Fu.
- Come back.

122
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
We've searched everywhere. The Fragrance Garden
and Jiang Mansion are sealed off.

123
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,000
They are all guarded by imperial soldiers.
Going there would risk your life.

124
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,559
I don't care. I'll find them
even if it means dying.

125
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,119
- No, you can't go.
- Let me go.

126
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,919
You can't go.

127
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,160
Mu Dan sent everyone off to save their lives.

128
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,920
Going there is suicide. Is that fair for Mu Dan?

129
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,200
- But...
- When you left the city to deliver goods,

130
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,759
Lady He gave this box to me for safekeeping.

131
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,720
She said to hand it over to you at the right time.

132
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,200
I didn't understand at the time
and asked if something had happened.

133
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,800
She did not say much, only mentioned
that on that day, I would understand.

134
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:58,323

135
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,319
Fu, Chun, when you see this letter,

136
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,559
 I fear I might have encountered misfortune.

137
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,039
 I have transferred the deeds
of Huamanzhu, Qingshuzhai,

138
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,319
 as well as Wuyong Hall in Sheng County,

139
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:43,279
 to your names so they won't be
implicated and seized.

140
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,399
 These three establishments are both
my entrustment and my apology.

141
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,759
 I hope you and Mr. Lv will keep using
the former workers and help them.

142
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,680
 Stars scatter and still shine.
A roc can soar alone.

143
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,240
 I have turned into a star, wishing you well.

144
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,119
It seems that Lady He
had already planned a future path for everyone.

145
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,800
I hope everyone stands strong and self-reliant,
not failing her wishes and entrustment.

146
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,440
She said "might",
so as long as her body isn't found,

147
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,720
no one can claim that Mu Dan is dead, right?

148
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,599
Yes, Mu Dan is clever.

149
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,359
She'll surely figure out a way to escape alive.

150
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,159
Let's manage the shops well,
awaiting the day Mu Dan returns safely.

151
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,520
Trapped in a cage yourself,
you want to lock everyone by your side.

152
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,800
It's truly sad.

153
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,919
How did you get hurt like this?

154
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,919
Break the guard's arms and legs.

155
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,559
Yes.

156
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,200
Liu Chang.

157
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,760
If you don't take care of yourself,
I need to have my subordinates be more mindful.

158
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,520
If you feel sorry for them, behave a bit.

159
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,879
Eat.

160
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,520
My Mu Dan, even as a prisoner,
still looks at me like this.

161
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,079
Over time, one day,
I'll make you willingly come to me.

162
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,280
Don't hurt yourself anymore.
I'll come see you again tomorrow.

163
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,720
Mu Dan. Mu Dan.

164
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,520
Mu Dan.

165
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,039
You are the owner of Huamanzhu and Wuyong Hall.

166
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,200
Understanding everything
and enlightening the world is your dream.

167
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:29,440
You won't be stuck here forever.

168
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,760
You have truly become the bright moon now.

169
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:27,359
We gaze from afar, and I can no longer reach you.

170
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,639
Mu Dan. Mu Dan.

171
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:10,319
No matter where the moon is,
its light is everywhere.

172
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:23,804
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

173
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:27,964
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

174
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:31,932
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

175
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:36,828
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

176
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:41,856
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

177
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:46,142
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

178
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:50,048
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

179
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:55,628
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

180
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:03,810
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

181
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:12,089
 ♫ Love is boundless ♫

182
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,680
You wanted to blend scents to relieve boredom,
and I had someone buy everything on the list.

183
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:39,200
Still don't want to talk to me, huh?

184
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,720
This aroma is rich and sweet,
and it calms the mind.

185
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,639
Does it have a name?

186
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,119
The aroma...

187
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,799
You really are an unrelenting ghost.

188
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:11,760
Likewise. Are you here to take my life?

189
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,280
I advise you not to act rashly.

190
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,200
You saw your beloved die in front of you.

191
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,000
The rest of your life
will be spent in ceaseless hell.

192
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,040
He Wei Fang, you finally understand my pain.

193
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,920
Losing my love forever breaks my heart.

194
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,559
But I won't give up on myself.

195
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,400
My life isn't only about love,

196
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,119
and the meaning of my life
is not based on any person.

197
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,919
County Princess, why imprison
yourself in eternal pain?

198
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,079
The Liu Chang who once loved you deeply
is already dead.

199
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,480
You should be concerned about yourself now.

200
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,839
Rather than exchanging one life for another,
why not leave here alive?

201
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,240
This courtyard is unwatched at the moment.

202
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,919
Why help me?

203
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,000
The city of Chang'an reeks of blood,
and I don't like it.

204
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Moreover, I have experienced
too much false affection in my life.

205
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,240
Even my father, who loves me, sees me as a pawn.

206
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:58,200
I can only be the County Princess, alive or dead.

207
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,559
There's no escaping this cage.

208
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,280
Only Zi Shu has given me
a heart that is utterly true and pure.

209
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,480
In this life, I am destined to be with him
never stopping until death.

210
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,599
Go.

211
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:52,119
 ♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight ♫

212
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,599
Li You Zhen, I have never believed in destiny.

213
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,880
So I will always fight with everything I have.

214
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,280
You can also do it. It's never too late to start.

215
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,759
Since you let me go today, I hope that one day,
you can also let go of yourself.

216
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,200
 ♫ Why follow the arbitrary guesses
of the common eye ♫

217
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,696
 ♫ Smile at the winds and rains stirring the dust ♫

218
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:29,647
 ♫ Flowers should bloom proudly ♫

219
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:32,279
 ♫ Reflecting the color of the sky ♫

220
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,559
Jiang Chang Yang has put up an act for so long.

221
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,800
His treasonous faction won't be
limited to those few at the Promotion Feast.

222
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,480
Your Majesty, if you give me a few names,

223
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,240
these people on the list can live,
merely exiled three thousand miles.

224
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,039
Sui Zhi wasn't only
trying to protect me with his life,

225
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,599
but also all those in the court
who forsake their lives for the country.

226
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:11,000
You can't kill all of the loyal ministers,
nor can you force me to abdicate.

227
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,280
Oh, Your Majesty, I merely wish
to relieve you of some worries.

228
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,800
Ning, you endured till now just because you
haven't subdued all the military governors.

229
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
Let me guess...

230
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,720
Shuo Fang has always been on good terms
with you and is close to Hedong.

231
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,960
Surely, it has already submitted.

232
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,639
You allowed Xiao Xue Xi to leave the capital.

233
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,760
Have you made a deal with Hexi?

234
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:49,639
You're laying out falsehoods,
trying to know my leverage.

235
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:03,920
In fact, the best move I have is Your Majesty.

236
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,719
As long as I have you in my hands,

237
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,840
who is the loyalist army
and who is the treacherous minister,

238
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,439
depends on the edicts issued from Chang'an.

239
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:24,704
So, Your Majesty,
think carefully before making a move.

240
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,600
Where is she?

241
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,760
Did you kill her?

242
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,800
Take good care of this wound.
Don't let it scar later.

243
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,720
I'm asking you, did you kill her?

244
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,719
You said that if I killed her,
you would hate me for a lifetime.

245
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,359
I wouldn't do something so foolish.

246
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,159
I just let her go. She's not coming back.

247
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,240
You should let go, too.

248
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,599
I promised to treat you well. Haven't I done so?

249
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,440
Li You Zhen, why must you break the peace?

250
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,319
Why can't you act as if He Wei Fang
is not in this world?

251
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,439
Only when she leaves can you and I be free.

252
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,119
Father is only a step away
from proclaiming himself emperor.

253
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,680
What you should do now is assist him well
to achieve your lofty aspirations.

254
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,439
If someone won't stay,
don't cling to them anymore.

255
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,280
Let's live our own lives well, okay?

256
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:35,120
You forced me to stay,
so how do you know that I can't keep her?

257
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,360
Who goes there? Stop!

258
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,359
Search thoroughly.

259
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,280
It's midnight.

260
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,319
Open the door.

261
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,960
Open up. Open the door.

262
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,000
Hurry up and open the door.

263
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Open the door.

264
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,119
- Have you seen this person?
- Search.

265
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,519
You, go that way.

266
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,719
Here, have you seen this woman?

267
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,719
Stop.

268
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,519
What's going on?

269
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Check over there. Go.

270
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,400
Stop. Who's there?

271
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Stop.

272
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,120
Search thoroughly now.

273
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,199
Anything?

274
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,239
No.

275
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,719
No.

276
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,920
No.

277
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,400
I saw her run in here with my own eyes.
Search thoroughly again.

278
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,999
Boss, there's a piece of torn cloth here.

279
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,879
She must have climbed out from here. Chase her.

280
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,519
Huanyun Tower has been sealed
for a long time and has long been unguarded.

281
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,839
My Mu Dan is truly smart,
letting me search for so long.

282
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:16,560
It's a pity that even if you are smart,
you still can't escape from my grasp.

283
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:24,999
Be good, and don't make trouble anymore.
Come back with me.

284
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,080
How do you know I'm hiding here
and not setting a trap for you?

285
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:44,360
If the County Princess hadn't stopped me,
I would have taken your life long ago.

286
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,290
Since you don't cherish it,

287
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,160
killing you here as a burial accompaniment
for Sui Zhi makes no difference.

288
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,559
How can you, alone, kill me?

289
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,400
Sui Zhi's hidden guards are all over the city,
and I have already joined them.

290
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,360
Right now, several crossbows are aimed here
from the buildings outside the window.

291
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:15,399
As soon as I drop this wine as a signal,
countless arrows will fly through the window.
