Of course, the horse is the only one who can do it.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Let's go to the main hall.

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
The fruit is ripe.

15
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
The sheep love to drink sugar-free tea.

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,160
Let's go to the main hall.

Episode 11

18
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,960
I know you're not a good person.

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
You're a good person.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,480
You said you didn't eat.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,240
Xiaochun, Wudan.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,960
Why are you so hurt?

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm fine.

24
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
You're fine now.

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,720
Don't cry.

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,120
This is the medicine for the doctor.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,200
I hope you'll recover soon.

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
I made the soup.

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,800
You and Xiaochun should rest well.

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Thank you, Liulang.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
We'll drink it later.

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
Go.

33
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Go.

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Chun'er.

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Father.

36
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,920
I was wrong to blame you.

37
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
When you were in trouble,

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
I trusted you.

39
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,480
I apologized to you.

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,080
I know you're a good doctor.

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
He Dianzhu treats you with all his heart.

42
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,400
You've grown up.

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,080
You have a good taste in people.

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
I was wrong.

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't like women.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,480
I pretended to be a noble.

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,680
I never let you know me.

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm happy to see you.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,080
I don't want to talk about it.

50
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,280
I don't know what I should do for you.

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,480
I just remember you said you liked to give me food.

52
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,480
From now on,

53
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
you can go to the hospital.

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,080
I hope you'll be safe.

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Father.

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,480
The wind...

57
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
The wind...

58
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
You're not a man.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Why are you in a hurry to change?

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
They say that in prison,

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
you have to take a bath to get rid of evil spirits.

62
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
The cangzhu incense sticks in the modan room

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
must be used to cure the evil spirits.

64
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I have to get close to see it.

65
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Jiang Lang.

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Jiang Lang.

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
Why are you here?

68
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,280
Are these flowers picked from the modan yard?

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,080
Jiang Lang, don't worry.

70
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,280
I bought them for money.

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Now I can't do anything to you.

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
That's good.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
You should pay attention to the details.

74
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
You can eat the soup first.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
I'm leaving.

76
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
You're my husband.

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Why do you have to separate us?

78
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Since I married into this family,

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
you never came to my house.

80
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Today, the heavens have blessed me

82
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
with a husband.

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,880
I'll take good care of you.

84
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Lian Zhou,

85
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
let me tell you the truth.

86
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Since I got the modan,

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,880
I've been very upset with the other women.

88
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
I know.

89
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
You've suffered a lot during this time.

90
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
You can open the door of the warehouse later.

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,880
You can pick whatever you like.

92
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Okay?

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
You're really a good daughter.

94
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm leaving.

95
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Why did you bring a fire?

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Aren't you afraid of fire?

97
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
I brought it by boat.

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
It can be used to drive out evil.

99
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It can dry your hair.

100
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
No need.

101
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I can do it myself.

102
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I can do it myself.

103
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
It's comfortable.

104
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Ying Ru,

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
you're the owner of the He store.

106
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
You're the sister in charge of everything.

107
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
You can only have a meal

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
in your own house

109
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
and in the family business.

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Okay, okay.

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
We were acting.

112
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But how can we act so seriously now?

113
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
If the moon sees that we've done something wrong,

114
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
and cut all your future marriage lines,

115
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
don't blame me.

116
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I didn't mean to do that.

117
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I don't need the moon.

118
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
If it really

119
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
makes me sick,

120
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll cut it myself.

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Don't cut it.

122
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
It's too short.

123
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
Cut it.

124
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Cut it.

125
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Good boy.

126
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Mudan?

127
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Open your mouth.

128
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Mudan.

129
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
You're useless.

130
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
No matter how strong you are,

131
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
you're not the one who took He Weifeng.

132
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You've done so much.

133
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
How can you not know the true meaning of a human?

134
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
But he's also from the Flower Bird Division.

135
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
You're not the one who took him.

136
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
You're the one who took him.

137
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Why are you torturing yourself?

138
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
The Flower Bird Division?

139
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
You're right.

140
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
The Flower Bird Division.

141
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Only when Jiang Changyang is taken down,

142
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
and He Weifeng is unconscious,

143
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
can he believe

144
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
that I'm the only one in this world

145
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,880
who can help him realize his dream.

146
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
That's not what I meant.

147
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
You're very fond of me.

148
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
No, Langjun.

149
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Langjun.

150
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Langjun.

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Something happened.

152
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
There were three bodies at the dock.

153
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
I've sent someone to follow them.

154
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
They're still missing.

155
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Keep an eye on them.

156
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Find out who's behind them.

157
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Don't let them get us into trouble.

158
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Your arm is still injured.

160
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I can help.

161
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
No, no.

162
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
I can do it.

163
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
You can do it.

164
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Where did the flower go?

165
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
It was sent to the house of Lianzhou.

166
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Lianzhou is interested in flowers now.

167
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Madam Mudan, why are you here?

168
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
I came to send the insect repellent to Lianzhou.

169
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Greetings, Madam.

170
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
You can't do this.

171
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
Here.

172
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Madam Mudan,

173
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm here to see you.

174
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I'm here to see you.

175
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Here.

176
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
You can't plant it when it's in bloom.

177
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
You haven't planted it before, have you?

178
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
If you force yourself to dig it out,

179
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
even if it can survive this spring,

180
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
it won't bloom next year.

181
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Is there something wrong with you coming here today?

182
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I saw you growing the opium.

183
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
I thought the flower was delicate.

184
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,880
I brought you a bottle of insect repellent.

185
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Thank you.

186
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Since you're interested in flowers,

187
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
why do you have to work as a servant?

188
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
You don't know how to grow flowers.

189
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Why don't you come to me?

190
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
I wanted to play,

191
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
but I didn't know there were so many doors.

192
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I'll play the zither in the future.

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
I won't bother you.

194
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Madam, I'm sorry.

195
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
I'll leave now.

196
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Go.

197
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

198
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

199
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

200
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

201
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

202
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

203
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

204
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm afraid I'll only miss my age if I stay in that house.

205
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Stop.

206
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Stop.

207
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm all alone in here,

208
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
saw that he has been every single day that I yawned.

209
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
It's so unclear.

210
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
What's next when your Turnip boyfriend will be gone?

211
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm a day old woman,

212
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,880
my Red Gate will end up as sweet!

213
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Don't到处 Republican him.

214
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
I'm dissatisfied with him,

215
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
even though he has turned out to be a woman.

216
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
I've seen his face thousands of times,

217
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
I want to go to the Kaiyun Temple for a few days

218
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
to pray.

219
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Kaiyun Temple?

220
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
It's a very hard place.

221
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Why do you want to go there?

222
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I want to ask the gods

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
for the fate of me and Jiang Lang.

224
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Sister is generous.

225
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
You won't let me go, will you?

226
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Of course not.

227
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
That flower is probably

228
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,000
picked up by the high-ranking

229
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Emperor Gaosheng.

230
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What is Lian Zhou saying to Zhao Cai?

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And there is a letter of trust at the door.

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Zhao Cai is a servant of the Jiang family.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Lian Zhou can buy it so easily.

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Zhao Cai!

235
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please spare me!

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You are not usually

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a master of torturing servants.

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What's wrong with you today?

239
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you having an affair with this servant?

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You guess.

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Jiang Changyang is acting in the mansion

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
not only to spread the evil name of the palace,

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but also to make sure that he

244
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
has a lot of people around him.

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Jiang Changyang is not in Chang'an.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If Zhao Cai is really a servant of Prince Ning,

247
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Lian Zhou will suddenly leave the mansion.

248
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Is he going to do something

249
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that will harm Jiang Changyang?

250
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm going to the Kaiyuan Temple

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to pray for Mother.

252
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's a good time.

253
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go together.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm a sister of Mother.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll go with her.

256
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,000
Madam, the appropriate room has been turned off.

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The Imperial jade seal is used in the Imperial Palace.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's a deadly poison.

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Madam, you must buy it.

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Madam, the embroidery is so good.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Although the silk dress of the flower lotus is old,

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
it's not as beautiful as before.

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The lotus is really like before.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The embroidery dress that my father made

265
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
was the biggest in Jiangnan.

266
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The embroidery of the silk dress

267
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
is not very good.

268
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's not very good.

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's not very good.

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not very good.

271
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's not very good.

272
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
The embroidery is not very good.

273
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
But now I can find it.

274
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I can buy it.

275
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
I can buy it.

276
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I can buy it.

277
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
I can buy it.

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I have a wish since I was a child.

279
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
One day,

280
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I can wear such a beautiful dress.

281
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
I can wear such a beautiful dress.

282
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
I can wear such a beautiful dress.

283
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
But in the dark night,

284
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I only show myself.

285
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
But my parents told me

286
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
that the merchant is not worthy of the death of the woman.

287
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Until my father was killed by the corrupt officials,

288
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
and the whole family was destroyed,

289
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
I never succeeded.

290
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,360
I can't believe

291
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
that I can make such a beautiful dress.

292
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
I can't believe

293
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
that I can make such a beautiful dress.

294
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
The merchant is humble.

295
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
No matter how big the business is,

296
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
the words of the officials

297
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
will destroy everything.

298
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Only when the royal family is returned to the royal family

299
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
can I wear such a beautiful dress

300
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
and be happy.

301
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I wish you a safe and happy life.

302
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
So the merchant was born in the Lianzhuang.

303
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
So the merchant was born in the Lianzhuang.

304
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You and he have been through a lot of hardships,

305
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
but you have lived a completely different life.

306
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
We are raised by our families,

307
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
but he is a family of the corrupt officials.

308
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
The hardships and hardships we have been through

309
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
may not be understood by us.

310
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I think when Lianzhuang was young,

311
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
nobody gave him a chance to choose

312
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
to use the embroidery to make a life for himself.

313
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
But when Lianzhuang was young,

314
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
the nobles gave him a well-dressed cage

315
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
to keep him in good health.

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
He thought that only by being a rich man

317
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
can he have a stable life.

318
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
It seems that the people who hate him

319
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
are pitiful.

320
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
The nobles wore clothes that they didn't need.

321
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
It's a sin to bury the common people.

322
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I think Lianzhuang has been

323
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
a little scared of the future.

324
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Just like the holy clothes.

325
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
He wants to start over.

326
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
He wants to start over.

327
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
When he lives longer,

328
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
and gets more familiar with us,

329
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
maybe he will change.

330
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I hope so.

331
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
We didn't see anything today.

332
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
We can't let the third person know.

333
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I understand.

334
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Let's go.

335
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
General.

336
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Cui Zhi, don't bother.

337
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
He D Each is down to his fate.

338
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:30,100
And this

339
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,560
I will be at ease.

340
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
How are the people of Sheng?

341
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
As long as the mountains and rivers are safe,

342
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,120
I will settle everything.

343
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,760
General, please.

344
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,720
When the time comes,

345
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,600
I will send a letter to the Hedong.

346
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Then you will come with me

347
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,480
to wish me a long life.

348
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I will be at ease.

349
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
What is the plan?

350
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Please tell me.

351
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Although I have a broken leg,

352
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I will not let you do anything.

353
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm so tired.

354
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Mudan?

355
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Alien?

356
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Why are you again?

357
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Alien?

358
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
The previous one,

359
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
why didn't you suspect?

360
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
It has already dealt with the past.

361
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
He didn't ask again.

362
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
The Ministry of Revenue is sick.

363
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
The position is empty.

364
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
You need to blow the wind.

365
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Let the people of the flower birds

366
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
to catch the king to get the position.

367
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Jiang Chenyang is in love with the king.

368
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
He is the king's favorite.

369
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I will not let you do anything.

370
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I will be at ease.

371
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Jiang Chenyang is in love with the king.

372
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
He is not willing to give me a chance.

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
How can I blow the wind?

374
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
If He is dead,

375
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
you have no chance.

376
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
What?

377
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
I have called you for a long time.

378
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Do you really think he is a family?

379
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
The King of Ning's mansion does not raise waste.

380
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
No one is allowed to betray.

381
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Even if today,

382
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
the King will not have a chance.

383
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
I will not forget.

384
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Jiang Chenyang cares about the future.

385
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
If he is in love with the king, he will do everything.

386
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
If he finds you,

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
you can protect yourself.

388
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
If he finds me,

389
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
how can he understand the King's order?

390
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
As long as He is dead,

391
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
he will not love us again.

392
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
If you really love him,

393
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
how can you have today's trouble?

394
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I did not understand

395
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
what Jiang Chenyang liked about him.

396
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Now I see clearly

397
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
that when he will take the power of the camp

398
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
and take the position of the king.

399
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I will not let him do anything.

400
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I will not let him take the position of the king.

401
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I will not let him take the position of the king.

402
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
And the good amount

403
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
will make you happy.

404
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
If you take a position in Jin Issue,

405
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
you can earn company

406
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
from him.

407
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You want to make him miss me

408
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
and use his position?

409
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Once General Jiang restore his position,

410
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
nobody will see that he took the position,

411
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
and he will not Target those who are in refuse.

412
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,720
You must give 50 or 60 zheng perform the operation,

413
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I will not let you down, okay?

414
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
I have heard what Mudan has told me.

415
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I want to learn business from you.

416
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Really? Is that what you think?

417
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,720
I asked for a loan for the trip to the Kanyun Temple.

418
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,720
The loan was said that I had no relationship with Jiang Lang.

419
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Now I have given up.

420
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,720
I hope you will protect me from now on.

421
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I will be grateful to you.

422
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,720
I will not be lonely when I grow old.

423
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Get up, my sister.

424
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
If you can let go of the past,

425
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,720
you don't have to worry about the future.

426
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
The days will be better.

427
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
The more you thank me, the better.

428
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Now you are in the Kanyun Temple.

429
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Everyone is with me.

430
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
We are family.

431
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,720
This flower is a gift for me.

432
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Please accept it.

433
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Okay.

434
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
I want to try a new wine today.

435
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Lian Zhou has a lot of knowledge.

436
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Let's try it together.

437
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Okay.

438
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
It's a good wine.

439
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Why don't you try this?

440
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
This Mudan is really beautiful.

441
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Come on.

442
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Lian Zhou.

443
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Why are you here?

444
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I came to ask Mudan to teach me business.

445
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Come on.

446
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
The flowers on this flower are really beautiful.

447
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720
When did you buy it?

448
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,720
I gave it to Mudan.

449
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
I think she will try it.

450
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Come on.

451
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Everyone, try it.

452
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
This is the new wine of Concubine Jin.

453
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Let's see how it tastes.

454
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Come on, Lian Zhou.

455
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
It tastes good.

456
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
How is it?

457
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Go.

458
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Yes.

459
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,720
Madam, the garden is on fire.

460
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Lv Genchun has already come.

461
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I think the fire has started.

462
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Don't worry.

463
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
The leaves have grown, it's all over the place.

464
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
What is there in this big garden?

465
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
сюда

466
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
That's right.

467
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Look, the Growler is watching.

468
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
What to do next?

469
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Here.

470
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Put it back immediately.

471
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,520
Let's see how you do it.

472
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,960
I have a sore throat and I can't speak since then.

473
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,360
What disease did Mudan have?

474
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,320
I gave him acupuncture and medicine, but nothing happened.

475
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,120
I can't find out the cause.

476
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,320
When Jiang Lang comes back,

477
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,760
he'll ask the Sage to treat Mudan.

478
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,280
He'll be fine.

479
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,760
You should drink more hot water.

480
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,960
Are you OK?

481
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,360
Mudan.

482
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
I lost my hand.

483
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Get rid of it.

484
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Don't make Bu Dan upset.

485
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Yes.

486
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Go.

487
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Go.

488
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Go.

489
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Ping Dan!

490
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Ping Dan!

491
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Go.

492
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Are you sure?

493
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Sister Lian Zhou.

494
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

495
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
How are you?

496
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm not feeling well.

497
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I have to fight.

498
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Your health?

499
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
My health?

500
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
I've always been fine.

501
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I've never been sick.

502
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
You rushed here

503
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
to drink tea with me?

504
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Do you want to ask

505
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
why I'm standing in front of you

506
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
so peacefully?

507
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,360
And this broken peony

508
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
is so small.

509
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Why did you come here

510
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
so easily?

511
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Lian Zhou!

512
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Why are you here?

513
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
I came to ask Bu Dan to teach me how to fight.

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
I'm a businessman.

515
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Since I met you and Zhao Cai

516
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
I've never been suspicious.

517
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I've been following you.

518
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,360
But I found out

519
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,360
that you made the poison

520
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
and want to kill me.

521
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
I know how to make poison.

522
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
But before I died

523
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I bought

524
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
the same peony.

525
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
The one you smashed

526
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
is not poisonous.

527
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
The real poisonous one

528
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
is the one I have.

529
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I've never done this before!

530
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Jiang Lang, it was He Shi who told me

531
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
that I'm a businessman.

532
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
So I bought a bunch of flowers

533
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
to give him as a gift.

534
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
This is not a rare flower.

535
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
You can buy it in this shop.

536
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
How can I prove it?

537
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
And Zhao Cai,

538
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
I just asked him to help me move some flowers.

539
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
I didn't poison anything!

540
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Really?

541
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Then look at this.

542
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
This is the confession

543
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
of Zhang Fang Shi and Zhao Cai.

544
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
They're in the government office.

545
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
They've confessed.

546
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
The owner is satisfied with the poison.

547
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
This is the rest of the money.

548
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
In the future...

549
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Be careful!

550
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Don't move!

551
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
This poison, this gas

552
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
was found from Fang's family.

553
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Master Zhang used to be

554
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
a thief and a fraud.

555
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
He was a thief.

556
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
He was a thief.

557
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
He was a thief.

558
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
He was a thief.

559
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
He was a thief.

560
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Master Zhang used to be a thief and a fraud.

561
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
How dare he

562
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,360
do such a thing?

563
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Please forgive me.

564
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Please forgive me.

565
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
I'm sorry!

566
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
And you.

567
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
You've been here for so many years.

568
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
No one knew you knew martial arts.

569
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Why are you hiding so well?

570
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Are you trying to kill your husband?

571
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
You're not guilty of

572
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
poisoning your wife and child.

573
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
But I have a question.

574
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
If you kill your husband,

575
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
how can you be a traitor?

576
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I killed my husband.

577
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
I killed him.

578
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
I know martial arts, but I never mean to harm you.

579
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
Lian Zhou sent me here.

580
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Lian Zhou wants to kill you.

581
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I don't want to hurt you.

582
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Lian Zhou forced me to do it.

583
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Please forgive me!

584
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Xian Ling.

585
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Lian Zhou was given to you by His Majesty.

586
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
If you take care of it,

587
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

588
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
This is about the house in Jiangfu.

589
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
When my husband comes back,

590
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
I'll tell him.

591
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
I won't bother you.

592
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Thank you, Madam.

593
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
I appreciate your kindness.

594
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
You're so kind.

595
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
I'm so lucky.

596
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Thank you.

597
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
As for these two,

598
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
they're evil and have solid evidence.

599
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Please punish them according to the law.

600
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Lian Zhou.

601
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,360
I treated you so well.

602
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
Why did you do this to me?

603
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,360
You really made me feel so bad.

604
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Husband.

605
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
You have to help me.

606
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,360
Today,

607
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
you poisoned Mudan because I loved others.

608
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
If you blame me,

609
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
what will you do?

610
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Husband, you mustn't do this.

611
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Lian Zhou was given to you by His Majesty.

612
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
For His Majesty's sake,

613
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
you mustn't hurt him.

614
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,360
You may all leave.

615
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
I checked the poison Zhaocai bought.

616
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
The drug is large enough

617
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
to kill someone.

618
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
But the poison in the arm

619
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
is carefully calculated.

620
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,360
It's a very delicate poison.

621
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,360
It won't kill someone.

622
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
So,

623
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
you don't want to kill me.

624
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Husband,

625
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
what are these?

626
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
I don't know.

627
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Please.

628
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
These are all the matters of the rear house.

629
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,360
I have something to say to Lian Zhou.

630
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Please let me handle it myself.

631
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Okay.

632
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I'll do as you say.

633
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
Get up.

634
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
After you came to the mansion,

635
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
you didn't get a single cent from your husband.

636
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
You think you've wasted your years

637
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
and hate me.

638
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
I don't blame you.

639
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
I don't blame you

640
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
because you're too kind.

641
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
But you've done something wrong.

642
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
So, I can't

643
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
keep you in the Jiang Mansion.

644
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
I understand.

645
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,360
No matter how you deal with it,

646
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
I have no reason.

647
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
What I told you before was true.

648
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
I never want to argue with you.

649
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
I don't want to be with you.

650
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
What I said before

651
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
is a free life.

652
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Maybe you didn't have a choice before.

653
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
But today,

654
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I want to give you a choice.

655
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
What do you mean?

656
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Maybe tomorrow,

657
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
you'll be returned to the mansion

658
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
and you'll be given to

659
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
a noble family.

660
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
You may be safe,

661
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
but you'll be

662
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
trapped in the inner house.

663
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
You'll be in a state of anxiety.

664
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
Or,

665
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
Lian Zhou died today.

666
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
From now on,

667
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
you'll be a new person

668
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
and go far away.

669
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
I'll help you

670
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
to a place with clear water and beautiful scenery.

671
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
When you get there,

672
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
you can use your skills

673
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
to make a living.

674
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
No one will take you there.

675
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Maybe when you get there,

676
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,360
you'll meet a man

677
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
who really cares about you

678
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
and you'll live a peaceful life

679
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
with a smile on your face.

680
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Men and women are not

681
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
forced to do this.

682
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
I don't want to delay you.

683
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Since you have a choice,

684
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
you can choose.

685
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
I'll never forget

686
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
the kindness of Wudang.

687
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,360
But you've been

688
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
so kind to me.

689
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
I can't let you

690
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,360
take my heart.

691
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm useless.

692
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
I don't want to hurt anyone.

693
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Please, Jiang Lang,

694
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
take me back to the mansion.

695
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Jiang Lang,

696
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
please don't hurt her.

697
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
Go back to the mansion.

698
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Go back.

699
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Go back.

700
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
Please.

701
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Go back.

702
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Go back.

703
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Go back.

704
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
You can leave.

705
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,560
流量孤相悦 唱相見
