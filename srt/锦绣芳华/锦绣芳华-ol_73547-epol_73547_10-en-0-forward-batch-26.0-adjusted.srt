2
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,039

3
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,950

4
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,079
When can we finally see the peonies?

5
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,399
Don't be in a rush.

6
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:29,699
The painting on the screen was done by a court painter.

7
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:35,760
Before viewing the flowers, you can admire the customs of our Tang Dynasty.

8
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,239
There is much charm indeed.

9
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:44,920
So vivid and lifelike!

10
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,180
The artistry is indeed exquisite.

11
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,619
Such secrecy and mystique.

12
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:02,620
Could it be the snow peonies were never developed at all?

13
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,779
There's reason in what you say.

14
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,619
Envoy, you may not be aware.

15
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:13,539
Our Tang Dynasty, rich in talent and beauty, always values elegance and charm.

16
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,700
Brewing wine while waiting for a full moon, or tea in the spring breeze.

17
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,140
We're willing to wait to appreciate flowers.

18
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,379
If Nanzhao doesn't have such customs, it's truly a pity.

19
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,900
We've waited eight days. Is that not enough?

20
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,200
The scheduled time has arrived, yet there's no flowers.

21
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:38,239
Your Majesty, you're not teasing us, are you?

22
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,150
I believe Vice Minister Jiang won't break his word.

23
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,330
Please be patient, everyone.

24
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,920
The time has come!

25
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,420
Look, the flowers have bloomed!

26
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,519
- Father, look!
 - Good. Nice.

27
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,839
These peonies can indeed bloom in the snow!

28
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,260
This is indeed a prosperous scene in the Tang Dynasty!

29
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,079
Indeed, His Majesty kept his word.

30
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,979
This lady has excellent skills!

31
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm seeing peonies for the first time, and in winter.

32
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,580
Look at that pink one.

33
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,160
Not bad, not bad at all.

34
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,760
Wonderful!

35
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,720
Look, birds are flying.

36
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,519
Hundreds of flowers bloom, hundreds of birds come to pay homage.

37
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
Blessings for the Tang Dynasty, with peace and prosperity for the nation.

38
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,500
Blessings for the Tang Dynasty, with peace and prosperity for the nation.

39
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,639
Everyone, please rise.

40
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,419
Thank you, Your Majesty.

41
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,460
Since the peonies had bloomed, why make us wait?

42
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,580
Is it deliberate to show the majesty of the great nation?

43
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,539
That's right.

44
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,140
- Yes.
 - It's suspicious indeed.

45
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,299
Why make us wait so long?

46
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,260
Winter blooming requires accumulating sufficient heat and light.

47
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,539
At noon the heat is at its peak for blooming.

48
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,319
The long Dongyu Road isn't built with one brick.

49
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,800
The prosperity of Heluo is not due to a single spring.

50
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,040
Tang Dynasty's present prosperity

51
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,739
wasn't achieved in a day, nor in one region.

52
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:36,620
It's the result of each country working together in harmony.

53
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,539
I thought that women of the great nation were like birds in a cage.

54
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,779
Once married, they must follow their husbands and have no freedom.

55
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,620
But your performance is truly admirable.

56
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,210
I remember you're called... He Wei Fang?

57
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,520
What does this name mean?

58
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,700
My mother loved peonies very much and hoped I could live like a peony.

59
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,199
Its moral excellence is fragrant, and beauty is dazzling.

60
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,099
People praise the peony's elegance and nobility, surpassing other flowers.

61
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:14,380
Your mother must cherish you very much to give you this name.

62
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,460
What my mother wanted for me wasn't unmatched wealth and nobility.

63
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,339
Princess, do you know that the peony grows among mountain cliffs?

64
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,060
It still blooms resiliently after enduring wind, frost, rain, and snow.

65
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,659
I think my mother gave me this name,

66
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,539
hoping I'd have the peony's strong and resilient spirit.

67
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,940
No matter what difficulties, I can be self-reliant,

68
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,299
and never give up.

69
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:42,180
So that's the reason.

70
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,620
Wei Fang, Mu Dan, I'll remember you.

71
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,859
Today's blossoming flowers against the snow is like a fairyland.

72
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:57,900
I'm very pleased! Bring the pen.

73
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,700
Yes.

74
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,339
He Wei Fang, a merchant well-known in Chang'an.

75
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,339
She relieved worries for me and added color to the nation.

76
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,539
I praise her wisdom and grant her honors.

77
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,999
Today, she is appointed a leader of flower merchants.

78
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,360
Bestow the phrase "National Beauty and Elegance."

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,680

80
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,688
Thank you, Your Majesty, for the grace.

81
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:51,656
♫  Nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you  ♫

82
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:58,152
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

83
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:04,003
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

84
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,904
♫  And never withering  ♫

85
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:12,832
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

86
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,779
Tonight, Prince Ning arranged a family banquet and invited envoys.

87
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,760
It might be an attempt to win hearts for future plans.

88
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,359
He…

89
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:03,980
Strange. What happened between you two?

90
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,860
There are no outsiders here, so, there's no need to pretend.

91
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,419
She received rewards today. I'll let her enjoy it alone.

92
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,699
Why should I disturb her?

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
What happened between you and Sui Zhi?

94
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,240
Nothing.

95
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,860
Although, Consort Shu,

96
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,059
you're accompanying His Majesty daily, why are you still depressed?

97
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,059
Princess Ashina Dan also accompanies His Majesty.

98
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:46,679
His Majesty treats her intimately, seems this marriage alliance will happen.

99
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,679
If you're distressed by this, have you told His Majesty?

100
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,380
Concubines are no different from subjects.

101
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,520
They should bow and obey, for the stability of the country.

102
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,539
But I feel if His Majesty were willing, he would've issued the decree already.

103
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,179
You're not saying anything,

104
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,319
but what if His Majesty feels the same?

105
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:26,939
Being by the emperor's side, how can one dare hope for mutual understanding?

106
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,000
Mu Dan, sometimes I really envy you.

107
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:48,059
Rather than guessing and secretly being understanding, why not speak frankly.

108
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,020
The more you conceal, the deeper you hide.

109
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,500
You hide your sadness, and also your true heart.

110
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,759
As for His Majesty's true feelings, if you don't speak or try,

111
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,079
how can you see them clearly?

112
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,260
Come on, Sui Zhi.

113
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,719
People speak honestly after drinking. Take my advice.

114
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,380
At the right time, pretend to be drunk or asleep.

115
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,400
Perhaps you might be able to see His Majesty's true heart clearly.

116
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,100
Your Majesty, it's late, and the palace gates are already locked.

117
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,819
As for the Floral Envoy and his lady…

118
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:32,860
They worked hard for many days. Let them stay in the palace tonight.

119
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,560
Yes.

120
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:51,319
Ashina Dan is bright and lively, just like you used to be.

121
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,439
If you hadn't entered the palace, would you be like her?

122
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:13,439
Juebei wants a marriage alliance.

123
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,550
Ling Ge?

124
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,020
Are you not asleep?

125
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,579
I can't hold my liquor, I'll excuse myself.

126
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,599
The north wind is cold. Why return this late at night?

127
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,959
Stay and talk with me.

128
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,720
Yes.

129
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,719
What do you think about the marriage alliance?

130
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,440
It would strengthen foreign unity and ensures the nation's stability.

131
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,840
This isn't the court.

132
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,710
I'm asking Huangfu Ling Ge.

133
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,839
I have been a wife for many years, and there's only Consort Shu in the palace.

134
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,849
You're blaming me, right?

135
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:55,340
You resent me because I accepted my brother's marriage proposal

136
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,120
and trapped you in the palace without freedom.

137
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,840
All these years,

138
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,939
you either moved to another palace or took refuge by feigning illness,

139
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,980
keeping to yourself.

140
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,140
All because you resent me, right?

141
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,620
If you want to resent me, you can.

142
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,640
I don't blame you.

143
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,900
I only hope you think about Prince Lang.

144
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,659
Don't torment yourself anymore and hurt your health.

145
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,459
I have unresolved postpartum thoughts, and it's just my nature.

146
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,419
I don't dare resent Your Majesty.

147
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,399
I've seen your former temperament, haven't I?

148
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,280
You were more open-minded and cheerful than Ashina Dan.

149
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,450
Only when you came by my side

150
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,620
did you become this way.

151
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,779
You're overthinking it, Your Majesty. I've never resented you.

152
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:28,980
Balancing court affairs, accepting more consorts, and extending the lineage.

153
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,919
These are your responsibilities, and I have the merit of declining luxury.

154
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,680
If Your Majesty is fond of the Juebei Princess,

155
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,480
I will organize your wedding banquet well.

156
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,110
Alright, I'll issue an edict immediately.

157
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,150
Consort Shu, prepare the ink.

158
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,680
Youthful past seems

159
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,010
like a lifetime ago.

160
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:34,090
Back then,

161
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,200
you gifted the bow and arrows you made yourself to my brother

162
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,110
and gave me

163
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,960
this brush made from the leftover materials.

164
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,650
I knew very well that I wasn't in your heart,

165
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,060
yet I still cherish it so much.

166
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,170
Little did I know

167
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,070
that this reluctance

168
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,170
would hurt others

169
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,590
and myself.

170
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,100
Why not make a clean break today?

171
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,000
They're both made of golden namu. How can you tell which was leftover?

172
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,750
This brush

173
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,910
was your true gift?

174
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,179
You're the ruler of the world, marrying me was only to uphold a promise.

175
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,960
Why bother with my true feelings?

176
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:17,639
The ink is ready. Your Majesty, please draft the decree.

177
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,900
Enough of this ruler and subject talk. Stop using these as excuses.

178
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:31,040
If you only respect me as the ruler, then concealing your true feelings is deceit.

179
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:37,880
This brush...

180
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,800
was given to Third Young Master by Ling Ge.

181
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,420
The person before you now

182
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,010
is still Third Young Master.

183
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,840
Ling Ge,

184
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,110
I just want one sincere truth from you.

185
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,219
My feelings for you are impossible to let go of.

186
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,040
But you don't know, so what to do?

187
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,780
Back then, I was glad the marriage agreement changed.

188
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,639
But how dare I hope for the emperor's affection?

189
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,520
We were too timid to share our feelings, and wasted so much time.

190
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,340
Ling Ge,

191
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,410
in the years to come,

192
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,790
please pledge our hearts to each other

193
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,480
and don't miss out again.

194
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,440
Still up?

195
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,019
I can't sleep. How about you? Why aren't you asleep either?

196
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:07,900
His Majesty feared we might be cold, so the charcoal is burning too hot.

197
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,000
How can one sleep?

198
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,219
If it's so hot, why are you covered so tightly?

199
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:28,419
If you can't sleep, why don't we sit up and chat?

200
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:30,119
Sure.

201
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,440
Let's first talk about…

202
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,079
when did you decide to become the despised Floral Envoy?

203
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:54,559
Old tales of the past are better left untold.

204
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:01,620
Alright, then let's talk about the future.

205
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,060
Do you have any plans for the future? Perhaps I can—

206
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,259
You have already helped a lot.

207
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,639
The matters ahead aren't yours to bear, nor should you.

208
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,079
When we reach the critical moment, I'll send you away from Chang'an.

209
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:34,000
It's not that I can't bear it, you don't believe I can journey with you.

210
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,630
Right?

211
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,900
The fake marriage back then was to save your life.

212
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,240
If I cause you trouble, it would reverse what we did.

213
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,900
You have your own life to live.

214
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,699
You must care for friends, family, and the business.

215
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,659
You shouldn't get involved in the court's strife.

216
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,140
How do you know what kind of life I want?

217
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,380
The weather is cold and snowy. I want to go see the flowers.

218
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,040
The palace is strictly guarded, no wandering is allowed.

219
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,130
The peonies from the imperial garden have been moved

220
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,760
to the greenhouse next door.

221
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:49,200
Let's sneak over there.

222
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,820
Turning the seasons to hasten the blooms,

223
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,459
only achieved fleeting moments of elegance.

224
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:22,399
It seems all things still can't be forced.

225
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:30,399
Sadness is inferior to cherishing. I'm with you.

226
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:36,359
The more we enjoy the flowers bloom, the more joy we gain.

227
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,639
I'm not drunk.

228
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,780
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

229
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,740
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

230
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,708
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

231
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:06,204
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

232
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,768
You've worked hard lately.

233
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,580
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

234
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,680
Have a good sleep.

235
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:22,540
I'll only sleep for two hours. Wake me up later.

236
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,820
I still want to see the flowers.

237
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,480
Okay.

238
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,578
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

239
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:36,180
Also,

240
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,530
♫ ♫

241
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,240
the Imperial writing bestowed by His Majesty

242
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,780
needs to be sent to the Fragrance Garden on an auspicious day.

243
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:51,959
Okay.

244
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:59,000
Jiang Chang Yang.

245
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:04,834
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

246
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,280
I like you.

247
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:19,796
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫

248
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:23,900
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

249
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Though the future is fraught with danger, and I might lose my life,

250
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,310
I fear nothing

251
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,060
and regret nothing.

252
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,200
It seems to be Xue Xi.

253
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,979
Xue Xi.

254
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:41,679
Mu Dan?

255
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,979
Xue Xi, you're back. When did you return?

256
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,499
I have been back for two days and was at the Royal Princess's manor.

257
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,100
She likes tranquility, so she didn't attend the palace banquet.

258
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,259
Are you in the palace to see His Majesty?

259
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,300
The Royal Princess said she missed you and asked me to invite you to visit.

260
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,939
Take your time. I have some matters to attend to at Fragrance Garden.

261
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:09,419
I'll take the Floral Envoy's carriage and leave first.

262
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,300
All right.

263
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,059
- We'll talk later.
 - Okay.

264
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:27,820
After taking her home, pick me up at the Royal Princess's manor.

265
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,159
- Yes.
 - Go on.

266
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,119
I've been gone for so long, you still haven't expressed told Mu Dan how you feel?

267
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,540
I'll tell her my feelings during the Lantern Festival.

268
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,419
This is the you I know.

269
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,040
What's your plan? Let me help you.

270
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,870

271
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,219
- Mu Dan.
 - Da Fu. What's going on?

272
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,400
Yes.

273
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,920
- What's wrong?
 - Shopkeeper He, you're back.

274
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,580
- Shopkeeper He.
 - Shopkeeper He.

275
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,620
Is that the His Majesty calligraphy in your hand?

276
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,800
The Flower Guild received such a historic honor. We're basking in your glory.

277
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,659
- Indeed.
 - Scholars, farmers, artisans, and then merchants.

278
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,680
Others have always looked down on us merchants.

279
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,580
Thanks to Shopkeeper He,

280
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,600
we flower merchants have finally had a chance to shine.

281
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,259
This isn't solely my achievement.

282
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,699
The floriculturists in the palace and everyone at Fragrance Garden also contributed.

283
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,259
You're all too kind.

284
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,780
Da Fu, return to your tasks. Please keep this safe.

285
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,359
Shopkeeper He.

286
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,259
Guild Master Lu?

287
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,019
Guild Master Lu, what brings you here?

288
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:18,900
All Chang'an knows that your snow peony showed the elegance of the Tang Dynasty.

289
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,300
Whether it's the skill of cultivating flowers or responsibility of a merchant,

290
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,060
I recognize I'm beneath you, so it's time for me to yield.

291
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,620
Guild Master, I have no such intention.

292
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,499
Besides, you've managed the Flower Guild for years, and I can't replace you.

293
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:38,780
The Flower Guild's decades of prosperity relies on employing capable people.

294
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:44,380
Shopkeeper He, as leader of flower merchants, you'll take us to greater heights.

295
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,960
I've already discussed it with everyone. Please don't decline.

296
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,620
This documents the rules of the Flower Guild.

297
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,739
Every guild head has signed this document.

298
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:06,219
The future of the Flower Guild is entrusted to you.

299
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,659
Does the guild master have the authority to amend the guild rules?

300
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,960
As the leader, of course, you may.

301
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,439
Alright, then I'll accept this offer.

302
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:37,920
From today on,

303
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,300
there will be no gender distinction but equality in our membership.

304
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,599
Appointments will be based on capability.

305
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,780
Guild Master, it's hard for women to open stores. Should we reduce fees for them?

306
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,340
I'm not amending this rule not to give women special privileges, but fairness.

307
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,800
Everyone works hard with their own hands. Why treat genders differently?

308
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,399
If treated specially, it'll only make the world look down on women more.

309
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:10,780
Guild Master, what do you think of this new amendment?

310
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,600
Very good.

311
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,700
Previously, we were arrogant and biased. Now we're rectifying that.

312
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,280
I must commend this.

313
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:27,240
Shopkeeper He, since you agreed to be the guild master, what's this?

314
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,780
I did, but I didn't say how long I would do it.

315
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,820
I've been the Guild Master for 15 minutes and reformed this outdated rule. That's it.

316
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,360
My ambitions don't lie here.

317
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,519
Guild Master Lu, you're kind and upright.

318
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,099
You're familiar with the guild members and fond of the flower guild.

319
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:51,119
It's more appropriate that you be the guild master.

320
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,340
But…

321
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,060
Guild Master, please don't be modest. Accept it.

322
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,300
Alright, let's put this behind us and not bring it up again.

323
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,260
Now that you've come to Fragrance Garden, why not try our new dishes?

324
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,500
Alright.

325
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:13,740
Captain Pei.

326
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,300
Miss Xiao and our Young Master entered the palace.

327
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,979
Captain Pei, come again some other day.

328
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:25,139
It's the Lantern Festival, why is Sui Zhi not home with his wife but out with Xue Xi?

329
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,499
The Royal Princess asked him to accompany Miss Xiao to the palace for the festival.

330
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:31,999
He couldn't refuse.

331
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:36,139
With Sui Zhi out with others, the Young Madam doesn't mind?

332
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,939
Our Young Madam is open minded and went out early to have fun.

333
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:42,959
No need to worry, Captain.

334
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,280
In that case, I'll come visit another day.

335
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,240

336
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,660
Madam, come and look at the hairpin.

337
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,280
Come on. Here.

338
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,499
I like it.

339
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:05,619
Look how beautiful it is.

340
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,340
Try it on.

341
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,419
Come on, put it on.

342
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:10,340
No, no, I don't want it.

343
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,280
Children of the martial world don't want such clunky things.

344
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,139
This one looks so nice.

345
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,700
You're getting older, you should dress up more.

346
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,159
This year, if you find a suitable husband, I'll be at ease.

347
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,860
You look nice when dressed up too, Mother.

348
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,280
Why don't you look for a suitable husband? I don't mind.

349
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,019
Don't talk nonsense. How could you say such things?

350
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,220
Someone might hear.

351
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,160
What's wrong? Are you worried about Young Master and Miss Xiao in the palace?

352
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,340
During the Lantern Festival, the whole nation celebrates,

353
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,290
and families should be together.

354
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,619
I also thought of my family.

355
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,660
If you miss your relatives, why not go back to Luoyang and visit them?

356
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,640
Alright, sure.

357
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,519
You don't know, after Mu Dan regained her status, she sent a letter back home.

358
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,449
But her father replied, advising her

359
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,459
that since she turned into a slave, she shouldn't do business anymore.

360
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:11,400
Marrying an officer and seeking wealth and stability were most important.

361
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,459
If Mu Dan goes back, who knows if she might be forced to marry?

362
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,019
That wouldn't happen. My father does care for me.

363
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:25,579
But he's like Xiao Chun's father, thinks marriage is the destination for a woman.

364
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:29,599
Since we can't persuade each other, we might as well go our own way.

365
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,900
Sending a letter during festivals to report safety is enough.

366
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,700
Besides, now I have you all as family, I'm already content.

367
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,019
- Thank you, and take care.
 - Alright, thank you.

368
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,939
Madam, let's go to the Qujiang River to see the lanterns.

369
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:44,820
To see the lanterns? Sure.

370
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,720
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

371
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,219
Shopkeeper He.

372
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,800
Make it tight.

373
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,579
You're just confessing your feelings.

374
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,780
Even when we were robbing and killing, I've never seen you this nervous.

375
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,340
In a bit, go find Da Fu. Don't spoil it.

376
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,960
If Mu Dan is willing to return immediately, that would be best.

377
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,180
If she's having fun and doesn't want to return, there's no need to force her.

378
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,479
- No matter how late, I'm willing to wait for her.
 - Yes.

379
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,860
My coming and going might take an hour.

380
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
Young Master, use this opportunity to test the mechanism again.

381
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,059
Don't make mistakes when she arrives.

382
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:37,459
You're so long-winded. Hurry up.

383
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,959
Yes.

384
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,479
Jiang Chang Yang.

385
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,932
I heard them say you have something to show me.

386
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:30,892
♫  Melting and flowing with you  ♫

387
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:37,705
♫  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  ♫

388
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:44,808
♫  See clear skies again?  ♫

389
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,700
♫  Clouds hidden by the night  ♫

390
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:59,419
In the past, I only dared to entrust my true heart to the bright moon.

391
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:04,260
I caused you to misunderstand, to be sad, and to shed tears in dreams.

392
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,100
From now on, you don't have to gaze at the moon.

393
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,980
I'm willing to run to you with the bright moon.

394
00:41:18,384 --> 00:41:23,416
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

395
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,119
Let's admire flowers and the moon until we grow old.

396
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,120
Even if the moon waxes and wanes, we'll never be apart.

397
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,910
Mu Dan,

398
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,080
are you willing

399
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,280
to spend the rest of your life with me?

400
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,280
Be careful. Young Master!

401
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:23,950
