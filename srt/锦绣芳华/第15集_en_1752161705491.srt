00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,620
On the set by Jackson, the

14
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:12,560
8th Shemansk photo lady

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:49,880
I put together thousands of

16
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,840
cap geehr graffiti on the walls.

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,180
Your Majesty, please get to your senses.

18
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,140
There is some telephone we Dodge should have added some on the connection cables for Raising if I jump for fear of finely apostles.

19
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
The situation is already over.

20
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
If you want to make a suicide attack on us,

21
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,720
you will die in the行人報 haven and come back ourselves.

22
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,700
Thank you.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,200
Yes, thank you.

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm afraid it's not too healthy for your health that your marriage will happen.

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,940
That's why I sent her to the hospital.

26
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,600
I'm afraid you couldn't bear it anymore.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
What if it's really bad?

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
and our shop owner.

29
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
I'm new here.

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,320
I'll do my best

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
to help you.

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Okay.

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,600
I've been through

34
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,520
the same as you.

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,240
I've been helped by others.

36
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,240
That's why I'm here.

37
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Now our days are better.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm willing to be useless.

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,880
I want to take the responsibility

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
of the saint.

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
Whether it's a woman or a merchant,

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,440
as long as she can be strong and strong,

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
and help the people,

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
she'll be a good person.

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,480
You're my family.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
I want to tell you

47
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
that I've changed my mind.

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,800
Please support me

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
and be with me.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,360
But we're all so small

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
and we're so small.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
How can we help the people?

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,360
We can plant flowers and medicine.

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,400
We can donate our money.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
We can do everything

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
to help the people.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Mudan, you're the shop owner.

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,240
You don't have to

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,880
discuss with us.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
But you think we're your people.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
You know us well.

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,600
We're willing to work with you.

63
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
We'll do our best

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
to help you.

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,440
The money we use

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,120
will be deducted from my account.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,560
We'll get the money.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,040
When we start a new business,

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,360
I'll share the money with you.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,280
I believe Mudan will help you.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,800
But you've suffered a lot.

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,800
You have to help others.

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
I feel sorry for you.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
You've suffered for the people.

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
It's not fair.

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm not a saint.

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm doing this

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
for others.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,920
All because of her,

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
you caged her.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,720
And that's why

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,040
we can't help harm her.

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,440
And we've got our competitions.

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
It's not possible

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,200
to beeping blood.

86
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Everybody who kowtows to us

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
should do the same.

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,320
The village continues toенить

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
its rules

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
and lockdowns everything

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
Only when the world is getting better,

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
our days will get better.

93
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,640
Only then will we have a clear mind

94
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,320
to enjoy the beauty of the peony.

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,800
I understand.

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,560
I will follow you.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,320
When the world is better,

98
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,080
my son will come back.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
I will follow you, too.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,040
I will follow you, too.

101
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Thank you.

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
How is the new store?

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
It's already selected.

104
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
It's selected in the Western Market.

105
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Have you thought about it?

106
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
The most important thing in Chang'an

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
is the medicine of the clinic.

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,040
How can you manage your store?

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Now the people are sick.

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
It's too expensive to use medicine.

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
People can afford to be sick,

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
but they can't afford to take medicine.

113
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,040
So I and Xiaochun studied the ancient prescription.

114
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
We found some medicines

115
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
that are also effective,

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
but low-priced.

117
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
We also have a new prescription.

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
At the same time,

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
we will also give a consultation.

120
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
As for the medicine,

121
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
it will be sold at the cost.

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
The person in trouble can also pay.

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
The value of the medicine and the delivery

124
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
are stored and sold.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
The cost of the delivery is different.

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
The cost of the delivery is different.

127
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
The value of the delivery is also different.

128
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Your capital is rich.

129
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
You want to owe me?

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I should pay attention to

131
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
the business of the people.

132
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Since it's a good deed,

133
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
how can you use other people's money?

134
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't worry.

135
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Now my store is well-off.

136
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
It's enough.

137
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Besides, I'm good at business.

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
You should leave your money

139
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
to the people.

140
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
There are many places to use money.

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Okay.

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
For the holy county,

143
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I'm afraid that

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,040
it's not a long-term solution.

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Do you have any other plans?

146
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
When I left the holy county,

147
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I took some villagers

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
and taught them how to grow medicinal herbs.

149
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Besides,

150
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
there are also some herbs

151
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
that can be used as medicine

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
and as food.

153
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
People in Chang'an eat a lot of fox-shaped cakes.

154
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
The fox-shaped cake is very delicious.

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
It will add flavor to the food.

156
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
You want to eat this fox-shaped cake,

157
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
don't you?

158
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
You're being too kind.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
You don't seem to like it.

160
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Every time you drink sheep's soup,

161
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,040
you put a lot of cakes.

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
The young men

163
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
can grow and grow medicinal herbs.

164
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
They can also deliver goods.

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
I also found some houses

166
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
that are not used.

167
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I changed them into a house for women.

168
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I and Xiaochun, Sun Danyang,

169
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
and Aman will teach you how to do it.

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Look, you can make it like this.

171
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
You can make it like this.

172
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Yes.

173
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
You can make it like this.

174
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
You can make it like this.

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Are you going to open a clinic

176
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
in the holy county?

177
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Of course.

178
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
It's difficult for the poor people to see a doctor.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
If there is no doctor in the county,

180
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,040
they have to come to Chang'an to see a doctor.

181
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
The journey is long.

182
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Even if the body can support it,

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
it's not enough.

184
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
But the food and the food are all expensive.

185
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
But most of the people

186
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
don't want to go to a deserted place.

187
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Who can make a clinic in the holy county?

188
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
I'm going to find two doctors

189
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
who are like Xiaochun.

190
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
They can train themselves

191
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
and improve their medical skills.

192
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
They can also solve the problems of the people.

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Of course,

194
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
these can only be used for ordinary people.

195
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
If you have any problems,

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
I'll ask my team to prepare a fast horse

197
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
to take Xiaochun to the clinic.

198
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
You are very thoughtful.

199
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
The clinic in the holy county

200
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
is only for the poor people.

201
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
If you have no money,

202
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
your family or your health

203
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
can be used to support you.

204
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
How do you know

205
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
if the people who come here have no money

206
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
or want to take advantage?

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
I've already asked Yu to give you

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
a list of the poor people in the county.

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
You can see if it's true or not.

210
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Since I don't have money to see a doctor,

211
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
I don't have to spend money on medicine.

212
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
If you do good deeds,

213
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
you will only be a bad person.

214
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
You will only be a greedy person.

215
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Moreover, the people need to live a long life.

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
If you lose money everywhere,

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
you can't live long.

218
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Moreover,

219
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
if I don't get the list,

220
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I will break the rules in the industry

221
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
and only get into trouble.

222
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
You are so thorough.

223
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm worried too much.

224
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
It's a pity that Yushan is not here.

225
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
If he hears it, he will be very happy.

226
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
He will have to eat more.

227
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Don't worry.

228
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
I will do my best to do what I can.

229
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
You and the saints are the only ones in the court.

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I hope you can get rid of the evil and the evil.

231
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Who is it?

232
00:11:48,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Check the

233
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Sister Mudan!

234
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Zhouzhou!

235
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Master!

236
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Village chief!

237
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
Come, come, come!

238
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Zhouzhou!

239
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Sister Mudan!

240
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
The suit that mother made

241
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
sold out for a lot of money.

242
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Today Mother's day is approaching.

243
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
I can buy two bags of duck feet.

244
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Of course, you can.

245
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll give you a few more bags.

246
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
When the time comes, take it back to the village

247
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
and eat with your friends.

248
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
OK?

249
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Thank you, sister!

250
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Thank you!

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Sister, what's your stall called?

252
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Look, ZhaoZhao, my shop is called Wuyongtang.

253
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Wuyongtang? What does it mean?

254
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,040
It means, everything is connected, everything is in one place,

255
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,040
everything is connected, everything is connected.

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,040
What is ZhongYong? Why is it called Wutang?

257
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,040
When you are teaching, you should listen attentively.

258
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,040
When the clouds and flowers in the village bloom, you will talk about it.

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,040
By then, you will understand the meaning of Wuyong.

260
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
General Xiao, please.

261
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Wuyongtang

262
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Father.

263
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I will not disturb the talk between you and General.

264
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Goodbye.

265
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Wuyongtang

266
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,040
If I don't come personally,

267
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,040
you will not be happy and you will not want to go back to HeXi.

268
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,040
No, I haven't.

269
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I miss you very much.

270
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I also want to go home.

271
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,040
But, your family...

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I have already told the King that

273
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
you should go back to HeXi.

274
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,040
You can choose who you want to marry.

275
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,040
But the King will not let me go.

276
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Father, what did you promise him?

277
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
You don't need to worry about the court.

278
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,040
I will protect you and take care of this family.

279
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I will protect you and take care of this family.

280
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
I won.

281
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Give me the jade.

282
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I thought you would give me something else.

283
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Why is it again?

284
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
You lost the game.

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
You are still using me to make a mistake.

286
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
He is leaving.

287
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
You don't even give him a love letter.

288
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,040
You are so petty.

289
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,040
XueXi,

290
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
I will give you a gift.

291
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
It is a flower, but it is not a flower.

292
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
You are not a flower.

293
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
You are a flower.

294
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
It is not a flower.

295
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
What do you mean?

296
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
The day you were born,

297
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
you came to me like a fairy.

298
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
You saved me from danger.

299
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
I will never forget this love.

300
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
You are so thoughtful.

301
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
I like it.

302
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
It is good that you like it.

303
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I don't think so.

304
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I will give you the jade

305
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
on the day you get married.

306
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,040
I will give you the jade

307
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,040
as a gift for your wedding.

308
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
I am so happy to have you.

309
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I want to thank you for being with me

310
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
and saving me.

311
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
I will never forget

312
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
your kindness.

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
We will be together forever.

314
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
We will be together forever.

315
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
The contract.

316
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
The king gives the stone to the king.

317
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
The king gives the stone to the king.

318
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
The king gives the stone to the king.

319
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,040
You are the girl of舞 sauce.

320
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Rang a large cow.

321
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Could you take care of my son more?

322
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
UW groove

323
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,560
Our

324
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,760
You come

325
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,920
Next

326
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,960
How are you feeling after the visit?

327
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm so anxious

328
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
And so comfortable

329
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
I' m not like the one who come here

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,640
You've always wanted to help your king

331
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
Now

332
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
I think it's only you

333
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Do you dare to do it?

334
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,240
I'm very relieved about the medicine you and Xiaochun made.

335
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,640
Give it to me.

336
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
That's great.

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Get up.

338
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Okay, take off your clothes.

339
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
What do you mean?

340
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
What do I mean?

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,920
You need to apply the medicine to your wounds.

342
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,520
You've got so many wounds.

343
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,320
You can use the medicine to make them better.

344
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,120
Give it to me.

345
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I'll take it back to you.

346
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,840
I'll tell you the result in a few days.

347
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,360
It's the rule of Wuyong Drugstore.

348
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,440
When you try the medicine,

349
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,720
you need to have me or Xiaochun with you.

350
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,480
If anything happens,

351
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
you can handle it in time.

352
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
When you were in a coma,

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,360
I didn't see anything.

354
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,880
What?

355
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,040
Are you shy?

356
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm a flower girl.

357
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
How can I fix this?

358
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,000
That's great.

359
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
It's not a man and a woman's business.

360
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,840
Then I'll leave it to you.

361
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
Okay.

362
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,560
This medicine can calm the scars.

363
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,760
Even if you're an adult,

364
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,560
it can help you get rid of them.

365
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,440
Okay.

366
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,560
Jiang Changyang.

367
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
I can protect myself.

368
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't be afraid of me anymore.

369
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,440
Sounds great.

370
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,200
Hurry and eat.

371
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,060
sufficient.

372
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Great.

373
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,440
See you.

374
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm not afraid of death.

375
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
When you gave me the jade,

376
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
you were afraid that I would be tired.

377
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
So you let me comb my hair.

378
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
But you are not tired.

379
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
The flower is outside.

380
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
You need to wear a mask.

381
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
When you get home, take it off.

382
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Take it off.

383
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Jiang Changyang,

384
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
you don't need to disguise yourself

385
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
next to me.

386
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I don't need to disguise myself.

387
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm always relaxed

388
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
when I'm with you.

389
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
It seems easy.

390
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Do you remember the night

391
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
when you were in a coma

392
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
and dreamed of a girl?

393
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Did I?

394
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Did I say anything?

395
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Nothing.

396
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
I just held her tight

397
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
and didn't let her go.

398
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
I just forgot

399
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
that I have something to do with the third man.

400
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
I'll go back to Chang'an.

401
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Drink more if you're happy.

402
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm tired.

403
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
And...

404
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,440
The one who got married is also tired.

405
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Mudan,

406
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I have a reason

407
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
to go back to you when we part.

408
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
On the day of the Lantern Festival,

409
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I wanted to see Yueyuan

410
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
and confess my love to her.

411
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
But I didn't know

412
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
that she hurt him

413
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
and made him feel guilty.

414
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I didn't dare to say it.

415
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
I want to rebuild Lishan Palace

416
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
and make up for the loss.

417
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
I've already sent the money to Zheng Shoude's house.

418
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
There are 500,000 coffins.

419
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,440
I don't know how many are left.

420
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
The treasury shouldn't be named Li.

421
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
It should be called

422
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Li Shoude.

423
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Li Shoude is a good man.

424
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
He's a good man.

425
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
The treasury shouldn't be named Li.

426
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
It should be named Zheng Caizhi.

427
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Calm down, Your Majesty.

428
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Your Majesty,

429
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I've been in the Ministry of Revenue for a long time.

430
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
I know the tax rate.

431
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
From the governor to the doctor,

432
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
the deputy minister and the minister of the city,

433
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
the tax is ten times more than the amount of money.

434
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Although I got the real account,

435
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I checked the real house.

436
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
I still don't know what the 500,000 coffins are.

437
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Zero up!

438
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Home sweet home!

439
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Huge kindness!

440
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Godfather!

441
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
The queen!

442
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
You must be tired.

443
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Rescind your words!

444
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
Mother,

445
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
and all officials of the Ministry of Defense.

446
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,720
Zheng Shoude has been the Minister of Defense for a short time,

447
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,840
but he dares to be the real and fake Minister of Defense.

448
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,000
It's hard to guarantee that no one will support him.

449
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,480
I heard that he is the recommended by Prince Ning.

450
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,040
He used to be very close to Prince Ning.

451
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,000
You said it too!

452
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,400
Zheng Shoude has been transferred back to Chang'an for a short time.

453
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,120
He has been walking with His Majesty occasionally.

454
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,600
It's normal.

455
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,760
So, Grand Preceptor, you have no evidence.

456
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,360
How can you slander His Majesty?

457
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,880
Your Majesty, I have a lot of talents.

458
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,680
I don't need to write a letter.

459
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,920
I just want to help the country and the people.

460
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Who would have thought that Zheng Shoude

461
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,760
would betray me and lie to His Majesty?

462
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,520
I feel very sorry for him.

463
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,560
I can't be forgiven for my crime of misdemeanor.

464
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,640
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

465
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,640
Your Majesty, please punish me.

466
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,880
Brother, I have never doubted your loyalty.

467
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,440
Your Majesty, you care about your brother.

468
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,320
But you are the ruler of the people.

469
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,760
You are generous and kind.

470
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,840
But you hurt the whole country.

471
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,240
Your Majesty!

472
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
Your Majesty!

473
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,240
Her Majesty belittles you!

474
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,480
Lady, your Majesty is HIV.

475
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,160
What would you do if the epidemic caught you?

476
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
Give me your gift.

477
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I'll be careful when I go back.

478
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,360
灣中堡� Erlai.

479
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,520
What?

480
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,040
Yuan Ruoz isolated Whole make aatha.

481
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:39,160
Livegelif in the

482
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,640
I can also scold them for you.

483
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,360
I've heard that 500,000 coffins are not small amounts.

484
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,320
But it's a pity to return them to the treasury.

485
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,560
I think we should give them some small coffins

486
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
so that they can collect the money.

487
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,120
I heard that you were drunk at the birthday party of Zheng Shoude's lost account.

488
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,400
You left early.

489
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
You know that.

490
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm always too humble to know the truth.

491
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,400
Lu Chu was very humble and humble before.

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,720
But he has changed since Zheng Shoude came.

493
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,960
He's been ungrateful since he was transferred.

494
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
Now he dares to make trouble for His Majesty.

495
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,440
Who dares to take advantage of him?

496
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,200
He only likes to make trouble for himself.

497
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
If he changes his mind,

498
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm worried about His Majesty.

499
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,200
So I came to show my kindness.

500
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,320
Zishu is now a loser.

501
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,320
So he can't serve His Majesty.

502
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,080
So he's a coward who wants to break the sword.

503
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,720
Or he still has feelings for our Mudan?

504
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,160
Who knows?

505
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Nothing else.

506
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,440
But I remember that you were very good at drinking.

507
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,120
That night the Forgiver GOOD OKUME must be tasteful.

508
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,660
Shooanta!

509
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,520
You did really good work!

510
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:46,500
And the

511
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,720
expression of love

512
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,760
has become cool.

513
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
You are great!

514
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
V추ward from an emcrew.

515
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
So interesting!

516
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
You are great, like Li Bai.

517
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,120
My dear!

518
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,660
No!

519
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
I wish,

520
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,720
if I can make myself happy,

521
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,920
and be always healthy,

522
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,740
such as drinking and playing toys.

523
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,720
Right.

524
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,600
You have good health,

525
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,920
and I'm pregnant.

526
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Please follow me.

527
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,120
What's wrong with your red mark?

528
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
It's just a stain on my makeup.

529
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Why are you so scared?

530
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Let me see. Don't lie to me.

531
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,120
You said you went to drink with Mr. Tang last night.

532
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Where did you get the stain?

533
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
He was drunk and hit me accidentally.

534
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
Stop hiding.

535
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
You said you were rich.

536
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Now you use my money to make fun of other people's makeup.

537
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
You want me to be alone and rob the sheep?

538
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
Why are you so angry?

539
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm not angry.

540
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I'm just here to accompany you.

541
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Don't be angry.

542
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I can't.

543
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Wang Jun, he's already gone.

544
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
He climbed so high.

545
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
He's really good.

546
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
You're really a good person.

547
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,120
You picked the most expensive one.

548
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Your business is going well.

549
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Why are you afraid of me?

550
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,120
How do you separate our air-conditioning?

551
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Let me see.

552
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,120
How can I say it's a good thing?

553
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
It's a combination of vitamin and vitamin.

554
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
It's vitamin tea.

555
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
The tea is pure and unique.

556
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
It makes people feel good.

557
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
I feel a little cool.

558
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,120
I want to taste it.

559
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Vitamin tea.

560
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Now.

561
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
I'm here.

562
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
What happened?

563
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:43,520
We broke through the

564
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm afraid that the king will hurt you.

565
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
You're afraid that the king will hurt you.

566
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Will you be involved in me?

567
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,520
I don't have to spend much energy on your shops.

568
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I've been collecting money for a long time.

569
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
I've been back.

570
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Now you still have Wuyong Hall to manage.

571
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
There are many places to spend money.

572
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
You can't do anything without me.

573
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
You can't do anything without me.

574
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
You can't do anything without me.

575
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
It's okay.

576
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I have a business.

577
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,520
If you really have an accident in the future,

578
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I can still have money to pay you.

579
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
You invested in the shop.

580
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
I'll save you as much as you want.

581
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Our relationship is not based on a contract.

582
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
I know you're being honest.

583
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
But it's not...

584
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm doing this not just for you.

585
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
I want you to win.

586
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Okay.

587
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Come on.

588
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Duan Chaoyang,

589
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
you can do anything.

590
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
According to what you said,

591
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
I feel very at ease.

592
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
If there is something wrong,

593
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I'll take care of it all my life.

594
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,880
Please prepare my order.

595
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,020
Thank you.

596
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,860
The Russian name list

597
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,860
I'm a little confused.

598
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,620
Your Majesty, these are all officials

599
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,860
who have been appointed by Zheng Shude.

600
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
They are all in the same party.

601
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
There is no difference.

602
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,860
These are all small and insignificant people.

603
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Your Majesty, please take over the court.

604
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Shilang and Ning Wangfu have come to visit.

605
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Your Majesty, today is the day of the devil's death.

606
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
What do you think I should do?

607
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
Zheng Shude is not a snake.

608
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Your Majesty, you are not worthy of the position of the minister.

609
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Your Majesty, I have admired you for a long time.

610
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Now is the time for me to make a great contribution to the court.

611
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,860
Your Majesty, please allow me.

612
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Zhang Qiuxiong has made a great contribution.

613
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
He is not careful enough.

614
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,860
For some money, he has made so many loyal officials suffer.

615
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,860
It's not good for the people to see it.

616
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,860
I really don't know how to make 500,000 officials.

617
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Liu Jun, you are very thoughtful.

618
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
Do you have any good ideas?

619
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
Yes, I do.

620
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,860
But I don't know if Zhang Qiuxiong dares to do it.

621
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,860
For the sake of His Majesty, I am willing to do anything.

622
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Have you made up your mind?

623
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Zhang Qiufeng has come out of Ning Wangfu.

624
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,860
We have no other choice.

625
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,860
You and Yunniang will take care of it.

626
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Yes.

627
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,860
The busier the peonies, the better.

628
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Don't let them get involved.

629
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,860
Yes.

630
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Here is the bill.

631
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
Madam, please.

632
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Madam, you are healthy.

633
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
You will feel better after taking the medicine.

634
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
Please take it.

635
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Madam, are you okay?

636
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
Lian Zhou?

637
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,860
I feel warm and comfortable.

638
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,860
I feel like a woman.

639
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
I feel like a woman.

640
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
I like to be with you.

641
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,860
You have a wound on your heart.

642
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,860
If it gets worse, you will die.

643
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Can you take a rest for a month?

644
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,860
It's just a gift.

645
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,860
I am not qualified to take a step.

646
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,860
But I made a mistake.

647
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,860
I should have listened to you and left Chang'an.

648
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
I am sorry.

649
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
Lian Zhou,

650
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
as long as you want,

651
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
it's not too late.

652
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,860
I can help you to get out of Pei's house.

653
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
But...

654
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,860
A bottle of water and flowers can make people have red spots

655
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,860
and skin problems.

656
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I will ask Xiaochun to treat you.

657
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,860
Tell her you hurt Doucheng.

658
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,860
She won't care about your life.

659
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,860
But she will kick you out of the house

660
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,860
in order to prevent the spread of the disease.

661
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Then you will be free.

662
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
If it gets worse, I will...

663
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Lian Zhou, get up.

664
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Be careful.

665
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Get up.

666
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,860
It's hard from the beginning.

667
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,860
But remember,

668
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
no matter what happens,

669
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
you should take care of yourself.

670
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,860
No one is worthy of your sorrow.

671
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
I have my parents to protect me.

672
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,860
When they are gone,

673
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,860
I will look for one.

674
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,860
I will look for you.

675
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,860
I will look for a...

676
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,860
another man's shelter.

677
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I am so...

678
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I have forgotten the freedom.

679
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Can I really do it?

680
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
Of course.

681
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
You are smart and smart.

682
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
You know people and people.

683
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
You are good at embroidery.

684
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I have studied women's clothing.

685
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,860
When you open your own shop,

686
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,860
you will have a lot of business.

687
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,860
Wu Yongtang has opened a holy county.

688
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
The farmers there know nothing,

689
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
but they can support themselves.

690
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
You can live a good life

691
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,860
without a man.

692
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Xiaochun is right.

693
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Lian Zhou,

694
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,860
I will send some flowers to the village.

695
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,860
I will send them to the village in three days.

696
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,860
Okay.

697
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Mudan, if you have a chance,

698
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,860
you should leave Jiang Changyang.

699
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
Ning Wangyao is going to kill him.

700
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Ning Wangyao is involved in it.

701
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,860
What is Ning Wangyao going to do to Jiang Changyang?

702
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
Pei Zhong said

703
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,860
he will put the blame on Jiang Changyang.

704
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,860
Then his family will be in debt.

705
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,860
I am afraid

706
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,860
he will use his life

707
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,860
to make the people happy.

708
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,860
Zhang Qiuxiu,

709
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,860
do your job.

710
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,860
Wow, it's a big gold coin.

711
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
Take it.

712
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Search!

713
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Search!

714
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,860
Search!

715
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Go away!

716
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Sir, you can't enter here.

717
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Go away!

718
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Sir! Sir!

719
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Excuse me.

720
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
Stop!

721
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,860
The officer is out!

722
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
How many officers did he kill?

723
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,860
How dare you!

724
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,860
How dare you!

725
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,860
What's wrong with you?

726
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
I don't want to be seen by you.

727
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,860
Jiang Changyang, let me tell you.

728
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Since I signed the first contract with you,

729
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
I've been with you in the same cell.

730
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,860
No matter what happens,

731
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,860
I will face it with you.

732
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Jiang Changyang,

733
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
you're not a man.

734
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,860
You're a woman.

735
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,860
You're a man.

736
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,860
You're a woman.

737
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,860
You're a woman.

738
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
You're a woman.

739
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,860
You're a woman.

740
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
You're a woman.

741
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
You're a woman.

742
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
You're a woman.

743
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
You're a woman.

744
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
You're a woman.

745
