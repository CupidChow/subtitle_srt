1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
magic

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,920
What a coincidence!

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880
You took in Dagger and you are glad to meet a new guest!

4
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Minister Zhang has raised five concubines.

5
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,880
He has hidden all the accounts and the stolen goods

6
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,880
in the most unloved concubines' house.

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
What a good chess piece!

8
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
You're so patient.

9
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
As long as we want to see the private shadow of the corrupt officials,

10
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
we can't find it.

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,880
It's just some magic tricks.

12
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,880
King Ning's evidence has been collected,

13
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
but his people have been withdrawn.

14
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,880
If we don't have the power, King Ning will not be able to do anything.

15
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
King Ning is getting more and more dangerous.

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,880
The party and the people are already worried about him.

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Moreover, the imperial family is not so easy to talk to.

18
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,880
He has already split up.

19
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,880
King Ning can't stand the departure of the noble families.

20
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
Even if he wants to investigate us,

21
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,880
he has to settle his allies first.

22
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,880
When he makes a move,

23
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,880
our east wind will come.

24
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Tell General Yu that in seven days,

25
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,880
the Hedong army will be able to come to the city.

26
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Thank our superiors for the information.

27
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,880
We will celebrate the fact that the subject made the request.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Yes, it's inevitable that the war will break out.

29
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
Although Prince Ning has no military assistance,

30
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,880
Zhe Chong's mansion is still in Pei Zhong's hands.

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
General Yu came all the way

32
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,080
just to threaten the Prince of Pei Zhong's men.

33
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,680
The square is our own garden.

34
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
The layout inside is as good as the branch.

35
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
If anything happens,

36
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
your actions will be more convenient.

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,080
Then the people of the square must be settled in advance.

38
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Don't worry.

39
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Before the banquet,

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,080
I will ask Madam Tang to stay for three days.

41
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
Xiaochun and Da Fu are not easy to fool.

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,880
By then,

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
I will arrange a business for them

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
and send them out of the city to deliver goods.

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
So that they can be safe.

46
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Mudan.

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Jiang Changyang,

48
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,880
when you kill Prince Ning,

49
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,280
I must be with you.

50
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
I didn't want to persuade you to leave.

51
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
Didn't we agree

52
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,480
that we will never part?

53
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,280
Mother,

54
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
you finally received this lamp from Xiaochun.

55
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Mother knew your name.

56
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,680
You just lit the lamp.

57
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,680
She must be very satisfied with you.

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,880
Of course.

59
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,480
How can I find such a clever and clever man?

60
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
You're here again.

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Please forgive me.

62
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,880
It's okay.

63
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,280
The two masters accidentally hit each other.

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
It was fate.

65
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Do you want to pay the money?

66
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
Okay.

67
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Here you are.

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Take it.

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
We are a couple.

70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,080
How can I give you money?

71
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
Take this one.

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,880
Where are you going?

73
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,880
Take it and go.

74
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,320
Why don't you keep her alive?

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,840
To shake the k recantation real hard.

76
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
We are destined to be together forever.

77
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Why waste money?

78
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
In this world, no one is more shrewd than you.

79
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
You can't even afford to spend this kind of money.

80
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
It's up to you.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Look.

82
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
He has done so many good deeds.

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Why does he look so bad?

84
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
He is so shameless.

85
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
He doesn't even care about me.

86
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Maybe he doesn't want to leave the bitter sea.

87
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
He is a merchant.

88
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
He makes so much money.

89
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm afraid he doesn't want to let go of me.

90
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
You're right.

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
You two are wrong.

92
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
It's not that he doesn't want to let me go.

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,840
It's me who wants to get rid of him.

94
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
This...

95
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
My wife is smart and smart.

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
She is good at everything.

97
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
But she can't let go of her love interest.

98
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
She treats me like this.

99
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
She is jealous of my appearance.

100
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Yes.

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
My husband is very good.

102
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
He is very handsome.

103
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
But he is the most unworthy.

104
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I hope you two can find a husband like him in the future.

105
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
low

106
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
three

107
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
What did you do to her?

108
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Sp מang , say something.

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Ouch!

110
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,280
You're good, Chuan Yu.

111
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
You're cheating.

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
Why did you do that?

113
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm not.

114
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,880
None of your business.

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Eat your cake.

116
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
You two are a good team.

117
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
If you compete, who will win?

118
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Of course, I will.

119
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Come on, let's have a look.

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Master, master.

121
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Master, master.

122
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Master, master.

123
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
You...

124
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Here comes the fruit.

125
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Come on, come on.

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Let me see.

127
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Please.

128
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Come on, let's start.

129
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Come on, come on.

130
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Come on, come on.

131
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Here we go.

132
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Who is it?

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Good.

134
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Good.

135
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Master, master.

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
You're good, Chuan Yu.

137
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
You're good, Chuan Yu.

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Master, master.

139
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Master, master.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Master, master.

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Master, master.

142
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Don't hit him.

143
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Watch out for his head.

144
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Good.

145
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Chuan Yu, good.

146
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Come on.

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Tomorrow you will go out to deliver goods.

148
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
I will give you some instructions.

149
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Da Fu, remember.

150
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
You must control yourself.

151
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You can't say anything about the old man.

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Do you understand?

153
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
I understand.

154
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
And Chuan,

155
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
you must control your mouth.

156
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Anyway, when you go out,

157
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
you must be careful.

158
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Protect yourself.

159
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Don't worry, Mudan.

160
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
We will take care of each other.

161
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Yes.

162
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
It's not the first time we go out.

163
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
It's like a farewell.

164
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Okay.

165
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
We'll be back in a couple of days.

166
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm worried about you.

168
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I'll make some food and wait for you.

169
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Let's go.

170
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Go.

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Bye.

172
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Be careful.

173
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Don't worry.

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
We'll see each other soon.

175
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I've been with you for years.

176
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I only went to the banquet.

177
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
After I met you,

178
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
not only my family grew up,

179
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
but also many friends.

180
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I was trapped in the house.

181
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I didn't expect it to be so.

182
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
I was so happy.

183
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I was so happy.

184
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
I was so happy.

185
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
I was so happy.

186
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I was so happy.

187
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
You've done so much for me.

188
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
You've given me so much.

189
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
I can't lose.

190
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Chuan Xinhe.

191
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
This is our knot.

192
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Since it's a love knot,

193
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
I'll tie it up.

194
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
I'll tie it up.

195
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
I'll tie it up.

196
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I'll tie it up.

197
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
I'll tie it up.

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
I'll tie it up.

199
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
How can you lose this?

200
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
You still have that coin.

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
You dare to talk business with the flower bird

202
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
with a coin.

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
You're the first one.

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I knew then

205
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
that if you wanted to do it,

206
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
you would succeed.

207
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Did you like me

208
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
since then?

209
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
When did you start to like me?

210
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
It's hard to say.

211
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
But that night,

212
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
you were still strong

213
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
with a wound in your eyes.

214
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I know

215
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
that I'll remember

216
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
your eyes

217
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
for the rest of my life.

218
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
The End

219
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
The End

220
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
The End

221
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
The End

222
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
This is mine.

223
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
A hundred years of life

224
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
are left in the heart

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
by each and every one of them.

226
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
The difference between you

227
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
is all here.

228
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
No matter what happens tomorrow,

229
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I'll never regret.

230
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Mudan,

231
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
are you afraid?

232
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
No.

233
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm afraid.

234
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I have a lot of regrets.

235
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
I haven't been with you

236
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
for the rest of my life.

237
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
I haven't been with you

238
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
for a long time.

239
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Jiang Changyang,

240
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
no matter what happens tomorrow,

241
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
you must take care of yourself.

242
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Remember,

243
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760

244
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,760
The End

245
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
The End

246
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
The End

247
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760

Good!

253
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Your Majesty,

254
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,760

255
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Your Highness,

256
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760

257
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760

258
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760

259
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
and wine and water.

260
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
They are all for bathing.

261
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
For what?

262
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Yes.

263
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Zi Shu, you're crazy.

264
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Don't say that Jiang Changyang

265
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
won't let go of her.

266
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
He won't agree to it.

267
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Although Jiang Changyang

268
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
is a new member of the Flower Bird Division,

269
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
it's not as good as

270
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
the previous one.

271
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
If he wants to

272
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
return to the palace,

273
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
don't be fooled by his words.

274
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Get the carriage ready.

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760

Prince Ning sent people

288
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760

289
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
I had to die.

290
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760

382
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Be careful!

383
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Protect the prince!

384
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Be careful!

385
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Prince, let's go!

386
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I'll take you away!

387
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Go!

388
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Go!

389
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Prince, let's go!

390
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Prince, let's go!

391
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
I'll take you away!

392
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Prince, let's go!

393
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Prince, let's go!

394
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Prince, let's go!

395
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
If you don't come back, I'll fight to the death!

396
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Kill!

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Kill!

398
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
I'm so happy!

399
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I feel so good!

400
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm going to give the peony a try!

401
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
I'll take it!

402
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I'll take it!

403
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Don't kill me!

404
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

405
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

406
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

407
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800

00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

411
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

412
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

413
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

414
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

415
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

416
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

418
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800

419
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

420
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I'm the king of the jungle!

421
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800

I'm the king of the jungle!

430
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:23,880
Important!

431
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,120
Jo, go!

432
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Go!

433
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Zhang Qian, take Master away!

434
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
You too!

435
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Be careful!

436
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Master!

437
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Master!

438
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Master!

439
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Jiang Cheng Yang, you've lost.

440
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,120
The fire in the commune has completely burned the trust of the King.

441
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,120
In order to confirm the day of your disaster, we found Zhang Qian.

442
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Since we can climb the sky, no one will ask for help.

443
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,120
The so-called loyalty orders of the saints,

444
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,120
the so-called loyalty orders of the saints,

445
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
are they not weak?

446
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,120
The more loyal the people are, the more they will be left behind.

447
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,120
You've lost, but you're still cruel.

448
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
I've seen these in the book.

449
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm afraid the

450
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Shi clan's loyalty

451
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
is too much for us.

452
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,120
I'm afraid the Shi clan's loyalty

453
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
is too much for us.

454
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
You've been playing for so long,

455
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,120
and now you're fooled by the King.

456
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
You're a good man.

457
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I have no relatives in my house.

458
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,120
There are only servants and enough gunpowder left in the house.

459
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Judging by the fire,

460
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,120
Yu Chang and his elite soldiers will never be able to return to the He Dong.

461
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Your Majesty,

462
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I know that

463
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
you've heard

464
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,120
the cries and screams of the fire.

465
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Who's afraid that you'll take me to the river?

466
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Say it clearly!

467
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
My wife doesn't want to die!

468
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Is your husband Liu Chang?

469
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Is he Liu Chang?

470
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
My wife is struggling.

471
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Let's go with us.

472
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
It's a misunderstanding!

473
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
It's a misunderstanding!

474
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
If he's Liu Chang, then it's fine.

475
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
I don't want to die either.

476
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I don't want to die either.

477
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Let go!

478
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Let go! I'll go by myself!

479
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,120
You should have said Liu Chang.

480
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
He is going to become the king soon!

481
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
What haven't you done yet?

482
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Sister!

483
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120

485
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
Attendance isn't important.

486
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
Then platform them.

487
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
They're coming to Port Beruction.

489
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
NVT,

490
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
No one understands anything in this sholdering.

491
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Braw.

492
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Mei called them here

493
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,420
in order to learn the art of fighting.

how to handle

501
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,420
I should have paid you back.

502
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
Cui Chi.

503
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,420
What?

504
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Do you remember what you promised me?

505
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,420
I thought that you should promise to kill me

506
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,420
because we are the Qin Tong's clan.

507
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
If you make another mistake,

508
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,420
you must let me go.

509
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,420
I'm sorry.

Mimosa!

515
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,700
I'll watch Jiang Cheng Yang's blood and bones with you.

516
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
I can't do it.

517
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
I can't do it.

518

Jiang Cheng Yang

519
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Jiang Cheng Yang

520
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,420
The life of a butterfly is very hard.

521
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
Check it.

522
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Yes.

523
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
It's broken.

Jiang Cheng Yang

525
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,420
I'll wait for you.

526
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,420
So better for you.

527
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,420
Already if you do.

528
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
Yeah.

529
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Sorry.

530
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Why so funny?
