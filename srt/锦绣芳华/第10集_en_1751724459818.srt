00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
have some быть

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
love

10
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
wild flowers

11
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,620
made by bonsai

12
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,900
before the flowers bloom, you can see the level of

13
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,080
democracy in Wutang

14
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,740
everything is corporal

15
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,020
You didn't plant the peony in the snow, did you?

16
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,620
I didn't know that

17
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,540
the Hall of the Unparalleled is full of beauty.

18
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,980
Everything is elegant and elegant.

19
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,980
The candlelight is lit on the moon,

20
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,620
and the tea is brewed in the spring breeze.

21
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
The flowers are not in the flower, but in the food.

22
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,820
It's a pity that

23
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,660
the Hall of the Unparalleled is full of such beauty.

24
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,660
We've been waiting for eight days.

25
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,220
Isn't it enough?

26
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,420
The date is set, but the flowers are not in the flower.

27
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,180
Your Majesty,

28
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,380
are you playing tricks on us?

29
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,500
I believe that you won't break your promise.

30
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,460
Please wait and see.

31
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,520
lease the

32
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,140
Pepper

33
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
What's going on?

34
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
It's open!

35
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Look, it's open!

36
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
It's really open!

37
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
It's really open!

38
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,740
It's open!

39
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
It's really open!

40
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
So beautiful!

41
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Saling.

42
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Why do you want to make us wait?

43
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Are you deliberately delaying the opening of the main hall?

44
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
What you say is right.

45
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Why do you want to make us wait?

46
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,740
The flowers need to be heated enough to be in the heat until noon.

47
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,740
The heat is the best to open.

48
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
The Eastern Fishing Pagoda is not a brick.

49
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,740
You can't open it without a brick.

50
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
The Eastern Fishing Pagoda is not a brick.

51
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,740
The He Luo Tian Zhong is not a power.

52
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
The Tang Dynasty has a great power.

53
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,740
It is not a day, but a day.

54
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,740
It is the fruit of the joint efforts of all the parties.

55
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,740
I thought that the women of Shang were like the birds in the cage.

56
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
They were not free to marry and have children.

57
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
But now I see you are so clever.

58
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
I admire you.

59
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,740
I remember your name is He Wei Fang.

60
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
What does this name mean?

61
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
My mother loves peonies.

62
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,740
I can be as beautiful as a peonie.

63
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,740
I am a man of virtue and a man of beauty.

64
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Everyone praises peonies.

65
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,740
They are beautiful and elegant.

66
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Your mother gave you this name because she loved you very much.

67
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
I admire you.

68
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,740
My mother's wish is not to be rich and to be rich.

69
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Do you know that the peonies are born in the middle of the mountain?

70
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,740
They have been through the wind and snow and can be fully bloomed.

71
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,740
I think my mother gave me this name because she wanted me to have a strong heart like a peony.

72
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,740
After all, I can be strong and not give up.

73
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
So it is.

74
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Wei Fang, peonies.

75
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
I remember you.

76
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Today the flowers bloom and the snow falls.

77
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
The night is like a fairyland.

78
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
The moon is full of stars.

79
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Give me the pen.

80
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
Yes.

81
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Wei Anybodyang

82
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,700
The r Mys鉣s

83
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,700
Jiaqi Huixin has been awarded

84
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,700
the gold medal of the head of the flower business of the state

85
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,700
The word is the color of the state

86
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Thank you, Your Majesty

87
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
The flower is blooming

88
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
The flower is blooming

89
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
The flower is blooming

90
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
The flower is blooming

91
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
The flower is blooming

92
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
The flower is blooming

93
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
The flower is blooming

94
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
The flower is blooming

95
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
The flower is blooming

96
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
The flower is blooming

97
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
The flower is blooming

98
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
The flower is blooming

99
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
The flower is blooming

100
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
The flower is blooming

101
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,700
The flower is blooming

102
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
The flower is blooming

103
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
The flower is blooming

104
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
The flower is blooming

105
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
The flower is blooming

106
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
The flower is blooming

107
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
The flower is blooming

108
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
The flower is blooming

109
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
The flower is blooming

110
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
The flower is blooming

111
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
The flower is blooming

112
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
The flower is blooming

113
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
What's going on between you two?

114
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
There are no outsiders here. No need to act.

115
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
He got injured today.

116
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Let him have a good time alone.

117
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Why should I bother?

118
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm sorry, I was late.

119
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
I didn't know what to do.

120
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
What's wrong with you and Sui?

124
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Nothing.

125
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,300
But why is Consort Shu still worried about His Majesty?

126
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Princess Ashenadang is also with him.

127
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Saint took her to him.

128
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I think she's worried about this marriage.

129
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Did Consort Shu tell Saint about her injury?

130
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Concubine Fei and her servant were not at home.

131
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
They were at home to listen to orders.

132
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
To take care of the country.

133
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
But why do I feel

134
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Saint would have already given the order?

135
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,300
You didn't say anything and kept it in your heart.

136
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,300
Have you ever thought about Saint's condition?

137
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

138
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
I didn't mean to do this.

139
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
You are so kind.

143
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Saint, you should be honest.

149
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
You are as deep as the desert.

150
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,300
You are the one who is deeply attracted to sadness.

151
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,300
You are the one who is truly attracted to sincerity.

152
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
But Saint's sincerity is different.

153
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
He doesn't say it or try to say it.

154
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
How can he see it clearly?

155
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Come on, Sui Zhi.

156
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
You are so kind.

157
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Listen to me.

158
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Even if you pretend to be drunk on time for the evening,

159
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
maybe you will be able to find out Saint's true feelings.

160
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Your Majesty, it's late now.

161
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
It's the month of the month,

162
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,300
but the year crumbs and the lady,

163
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
trained in the trials

164
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
should decide who will stay in the Palace tonight as well.

165
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Yes.

166
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm afraid that the fame of Ashena is gone.

167
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
It's like you in the past.

168
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
If you didn't attack,

169
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
would you be like her?

170
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
I'm not like her.

171
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
There is a marriage between us.

172
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Brother Lian,

173
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
you didn't sleep?

174
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
I have no more wine.

175
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
I'm leaving.

176
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
It's cold in the north.

177
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Why do you go back to the palace?

178
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Talk to me.

179
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Yes.

180
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
The end

181
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
What do you do

182
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
in the marriage?

183
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
I drink.

184
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
I have no more wine.

185
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
What do you do in the marriage?

186
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I'm a maid.

187
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
How do you get married?

188
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm a maid.

189
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,300
You're a maid?

190
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I'm a maid.

191
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
You're a maid.

192
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
You're a maid.

193
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I'm not a concubine.

194
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
You're blaming me, aren't you?

195
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I was the one who made the marriage contract.

196
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
I trapped you in the palace.

197
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
You can't be free.

198
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
All these years,

199
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
you've been either going to the palace or

200
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
going to the hospital to recover.

201
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
You've been out of luck.

202
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
You're blaming me for all this, aren't you?

203
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
If you want to blame me, then do it.

204
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
I don't blame you.

205
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
I just hope you can think of your father.

206
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Don't hurt yourself.

207
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm too young to be a concubine.

208
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,300
I don't want to hate you.

209
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Have you never seen a woman like me before?

210
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
You're even more open-minded than that Ashenadan.

211
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
It's just that you've become like this

212
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
when you're with me.

213
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Your Majesty, you're too kind.

214
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I've never blamed you.

215
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
The balance of the court, the great palace concubines,

216
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
the people and their children

217
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
are all the responsibility of the saint.

218
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I should have the right to be sure.

219
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,300
If you're willing to be a princess,

220
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I'll do my best to prepare your wedding.

221
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Okay.

222
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I'll do it right away.

223
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Please don't say anything.

224
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
I'm sorry.

225
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
The past is like the past.

226
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
It's like the past.

227
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Back then,

228
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
you gave me the bow and arrow

229
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
that you made for my brother.

230
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
But you gave me

231
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:16,520
the

232
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
bow and arrow.

233
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
I don't know

234
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,300
if I deserve

235
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
this bow and arrow.

236
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
I deserve it.

237
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Why don't we end it today?

238
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
It's the same thing.

239
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,300
How do you know which bow and arrow is better?

240
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Is this the bow and arrow

241
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
that you've been hiding?

242
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Your Majesty is the king of the world.

243
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
It's just a contract to marry me.

244
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Why do you care about my sincerity?

245
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
I've done the magic.

246
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Your Majesty, please do it.

247
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
What do you mean by the king and the princess?

248
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Don't use this word to insult me.

249
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
If you only respect the royal family,

250
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
I'll do the same to you.

251
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I'll do the same to you.

252
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
If you don't love me,

253
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
I'll do the same to you.

254
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
This is the bow

255
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
that I gave you.

256
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
The person in front of you

257
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
is still me.

258
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,300
I just want

259
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
you to say something

260
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
that you really mean to me.

261
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
A man's heart

262
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
is not a flower.

263
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
A man's heart

264
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
is not a flower.

265
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
A man's heart

266
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,300
is not a flower.

267
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I was lucky enough to marry you.

268
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
But how do I feel

269
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
the heart of the king?

270
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
We can't be together

271
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
until now.

272
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Brother Yan,

273
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
please be kind to me.

274
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Don't miss it.

275
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
I love you.

276
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Are you sleepy?

277
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I can't sleep.

278
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
What about you?

279
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Why didn't you sleep?

280
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm afraid that we'll freeze.

281
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
The charcoal is too hot.

282
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
How can I sleep?

283
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Since it's so hot,

284
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
why are you so cold?

285
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
If you can't sleep,

286
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
why don't we

287
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
sit down and chat?

288
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Okay.

289
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Let's talk about

290
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
when did you decide

291
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
to be a flower bird

292
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
that everyone curses?

293
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
It's a long story.

294
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
It's okay if you don't mention it.

295
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Okay.

296
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Let's talk about the future.

297
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
What are your plans for the future?

298
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Maybe I can...

299
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
You've helped me a lot.

300
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
The rest

301
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
is not something you can bear.

302
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
And it's not your turn to bear it.

303
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I'm sorry.

304
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm sorry.

306
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
I'll take you to the end

307
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
of the world.

308
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I can't bear it.

309
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
You don't believe that I can walk with you.

310
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Right?

311
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
When I pretended to be married,

312
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I was trying to save your life.

313
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
If I dragged you into this,

314
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
wouldn't I have done it?

315
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
You have your own life to live.

318
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
You have to take care of your friends,

319
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
business and business.

320
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
You shouldn't get involved

321
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
in the chaos of the court.

322
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
How do you know

323
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
what kind of life I want to live?

324
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
It's cold in the snow.

325
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
I'm going out to see the flowers.

326
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
I'm going to see the flowers.

327
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
The peonies from the jade garden

328
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
are all in the warm room next door.

329
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
We'll sneak over there.

330
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
I'll go with you.

331
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
The opposite side of the sky

332
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
is full of flowers.

333
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Only a little bit of flowers can be found.

334
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
It seems that everything

335
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
can't be forced.

336
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
If you really want to,

337
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
I'll go with you.

338
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
The more flowers bloom,

339
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
the more joy there is.

340
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
I'm not drunk.

342
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
You've worked hard today.

343
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Have a good sleep.

344
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I just slept for an hour.

345
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,300
I'm sorry.

348
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,300
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
I'm sorry.

351
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
I'm sorry.

353
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I just slept for an hour.

355
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
If you wake me up later,

356
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm going to see the flowers.

357
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Okay.

358
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
And...

359
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
The jade vase from the saint

360
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
will be picked from a yellow sword

361
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
and moved to my garden.

362
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
Okay.

363
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
Zhang Chaoyang.

364
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I like you.

365
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
I love you.

366
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
I love you more than anything in particular.

367
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I won't 해 it again.

368
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
I won't worry about anything.

369
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Okay.

370
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
I'm going.

371
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
I will.

372
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,300
Move.

373
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
Okay.

374
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Your hand!

375
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
What a fool!

376
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,540
You are beautiful!

377
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
And he is a little bit snobbish.

378
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
What a creep!

379
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
You're back. When did you come back?

380
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I've been back for two days.

381
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
I've been staying at the Princess's house.

382
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
She likes to be alone, so she didn't come to the banquet.

383
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Is it a visit to the Palace?

384
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
The Princess said she missed you.

385
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
She asked me to invite you to her place.

386
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
You can talk slowly.

387
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
I have something to do in the garden.

388
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
I'll take the carriage to the flower room and go back.

389
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Okay.

390
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
We'll talk later.

391
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Okay.

392
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Send the little lady to the Princess's house.

393
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Yes.

394
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Go.

395
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,300
I've been away for so long.

396
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
You haven't expressed your feelings to Mudan yet.

397
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
I'll express my feelings to her

398
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
as soon as possible.

399
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
This is who I know.

400
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I'll help you if you have any plans.

401
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Mudan.

402
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Da Fu.

403
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
What's going on?

404
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
You are...

405
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
He Dianzhu.

406
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
You have a great reputation.

407
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
It's the first time

408
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
that the Emperor of Hua Hang has such a great honor.

409
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
We really owe you a lot.

410
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
Yes.

411
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Everyone says that the farmers are the ones who make the business.

412
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
But they don't like us.

413
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Thanks to He Dianzhu,

414
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
we have a great reputation.

415
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Yes.

416
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,300
I didn't do this alone.

417
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
The garden and the garden are all very good.

418
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
You are very kind.

419
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Da Fu.

420
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
Go back to your work.

421
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Keep this.

422
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
He Dianzhu.

423
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Lv Hangtou.

424
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Lv Hangtou.

425
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Lv Hangtou.

426
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
You are...

427
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,300
He Dianzhu has been cultivating the Mudan in the snow.

428
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:20,240
He has been spreading the

429
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
mudan.

430
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
He Dianzhu is now the leader of the Hua

431
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Hang.

432
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
He will be able to lead the Hang meeting.

433
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
I have already made a deal with everyone.

434
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Please do not refuse.

435
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
What is written on this is

436
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
the Hang rule of Hua Hang.

437
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Lv Hangtou

438
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
is on the chess board.

439
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Hua Hang will be

440
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
entrusted to you in the future.

441
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Lv Hangtou

442
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
has the right to change the Hang rule?

443
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,300
He is the leader.

444
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Of course.

445
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Okay.

446
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
I will make

447
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
this Hangtou.

448
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
From today on,

449
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
the people of Hua Hang

450
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
will not be divided into men and women.

451
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
They will be treated equally.

452
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
They will be treated equally.

453
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Lv Hangtou,

454
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
women do not want to open their stores.

455
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Can you give them a discount?

456
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I will give them a discount.

457
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Lv Hangtou,

458
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
I will give them a discount.

459
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Lv Hangtou,

460
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Lv Hangtou,

461
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Lv Hangtou,

462
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Lv Honey.

463
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,300
Lurking,

464
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:50,900
Lv

465
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,420
her

466
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
Linda to

467
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,460
watch

468
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
Ha embraced

469
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Lv

470
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
I will quit.

471
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
You have promised to be a head of the trade union.

472
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
What do you mean?

473
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
I have promised.

474
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
But I didn't say how long I would be.

475
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
I have already been a head of the trade union.

476
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
Once I change the old rules, it's enough.

477
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
I will not stay here.

478
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
I will be a head of the trade union.

479
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
I will be a good person.

480
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
I will be a good person.

481
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
I will be a good person.

482
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
You should be the head of the trade union.

483
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
You should be the head of the trade union.

484
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
You should be the head of the trade union.

485
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Yes.

486
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
You are welcome.

487
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Take it.

488
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Okay, we have talked about it.

489
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,460
You don't have to mention it again.

490
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
You are all here to visit.

491
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Why don't you stay and taste our new dishes?

492
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Commandant Pei.

493
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Lady Xiao and my husband are in the palace.

494
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Commandant Pei, come back another day.

495
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
It's the festival of Shangyuan.

496
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I didn't stay at home with my beautiful wife.

497
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
I will spend time with Xuexi.

498
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
The head of the trade union asked my husband to spend time with Lady Xiao.

499
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
He will not refuse.

500
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
I will spend time with other people.

501
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,460
Your wife is not interested.

502
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
My wife is very generous.

503
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
She went out early.

504
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
I don't need your concern.

505
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
I will wait for you outside.

506
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Thank you.

507
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Madam, look at the hairpin.

508
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Come on.

509
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
I like it.

510
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Look, it's beautiful.

511
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
Thank you.

512
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Take it.

513
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
No, I don't want it.

514
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
I don't want this hairpin.

515
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,460
It's beautiful.

516
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,460
You are getting old.

517
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
You should dress up more.

518
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,460
You will have a good husband this year.

519
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I will be relieved.

520
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
I will dress up more.

521
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
You should have a good husband.

522
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
I don't mind.

523
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Don't talk nonsense.

524
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
Listen to me.

525
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
What's wrong with you?

526
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Do you still think about the attack on the general and Lady Xiao?

527
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
The family is in good health.

528
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
The family should be together.

529
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
I miss my family too.

530
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
I miss my family too.

531
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Why don't you go back to Luoyang?

532
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Okay.

533
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
You don't know.

534
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
After the recovery of the mother, she sent her uncle back.

535
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
But her father persuaded her to stop doing business in the street.

536
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,460
He said she was a slave.

537
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
You should get married.

538
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
It's important to have a good life.

539
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
If she goes back,

540
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
will she be tied up?

541
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
She won't be tied up.

542
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,460
My father doesn't hate me.

543
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
But he thinks that

544
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
a woman's marriage is the final home.

545
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,460
He thinks that

546
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
a woman's marriage is the final home.

547
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
You should be happy.

548
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
You can write a letter to the government.

549
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,460
It's enough.

550
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
And now,

551
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm satisfied with these families.

552
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Okay.

553
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
Madam,

554
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
let's go to the district office.

555
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,460
Okay.

556
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
Let's go.

557
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
He?

558
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
He's so calm.

559
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,460
He's so sincere.

560
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,460
He's so nervous.

561
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
He's so nervous.

562
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,460
You should go to the Buddha.

563
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
It's best if she comes back.

564
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
But she's too strong.

565
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,460
She doesn't want to go back.

566
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,460
I'll wait for her.

567
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Okay.

568
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,460
I'll wait for an hour.

569
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,460
You should try to get her back.

570
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
I'll wait for her.

571
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Okay.

572
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Go.

573
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Go.

574
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Jiang Changyang.

575
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,460
I heard that

576
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,460
you have something to show me.

577
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,460
It's 1966.

578
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
40 years ago.

579
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
Thank you.

580
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Thank you.

581
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
I saw you play childhood games

582
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,460
together with dears.

583
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,460
Don't perform a baseball game.

584
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Okay.

585
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
The more you keep singing,

586
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
the more you're used to it.

587
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Maybe.

588
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Perhaps.

589
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
and fall into a dream.

590
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Your Majesty,

591
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,460
you don't have to

592
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
sing the song of the night.

593
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
I'm willing to run to you

594
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,460
with the moon.

595
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
To sing the song of the night

596
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
is to be with you.

597
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
Even if we lack something,

598
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
we will never be apart.

599
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
Mudan,

600
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
will you spend your life

601
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,460
with me?

602
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,460
I'm sorry.

603
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,460
Slowly.

604
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,460
Wang Jun!

605
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,460
I'm sorry.

606
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
I'm sorry.

607
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,460
The End
