1
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,039

2
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,159
Minister Zhang kept five concubines
in separate residences.

3
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,319
He hid all the accounts and illicit gains

4
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,480
in the least favored concubine's residence.

5
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,920
What a complex game this is!
I can't believe you had the patience to set it up.

6
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,640
As for the secrets of the corrupt officials,

7
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,519
if Sui Zhi decides to uncover them,
nothing is beyond our reach.

8
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,679
It's just some bizarre tricks
and underhanded arts.

9
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,360
The evidence of Prince Ning's crimes is ready,
but his associates are being continuously removed.

10
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,800
No matter how seamless we did it,
Prince Ning is bound to become suspicious.

11
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,080
Prince Ning is gradually losing power,
and his followers can also see that.

12
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,919
Their morale is already unstable,
let alone the failure in the imperial examination.

13
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,360
The noble families are not so easily persuaded.

14
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,480
He can no longer manage everything simultaneously.

15
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,240
Prince Ning can no longer
afford to alienate the aristocracy.

16
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,159
Even if he wants to investigate us,
he must first placate his allies.

17
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,279
Once he makes a move,
our favorable conditions will arrive.

18
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,880

19
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,920
the Hedong Army can be at the city's gates.

20
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,719
The Promotion Feast is set by the officials
to express gratitude for His Majesty's grace.

21
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,039
Since you're hosting, it's reasonable
to hold it in the Fragrance Garden.

22
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,560
When the time comes for the grand plan,
conflict may be inevitable.

23
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,719
Prince Ning doesn't have the Ministry of War,
but Pei Zhong has the Local Guards under control.

24
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,599
General Yu has come from afar
precisely to intimidate Pei Zhong's troops, no?

25
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,080
The Fragrance Garden is our own place,
and you are familiar with its layout.

26
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,399
If anything happens,
you will find it easier to act.

27
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,000
The people in the Fragrance Garden
must be properly arranged in advance.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,800
I will have Madam Tang and the others
leave three days before the feast. Don't worry.

29
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,919
It's not easy to deceive Chun and Fu.

30
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,199
I will arrange an order for them

31
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,719
and let them leave the city
to deliver goods, to be sure.

32
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Mu Dan.

33
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,840
Jiang Chang Yang, when you settle accounts
with Prince Ning, I must be at your side.

34
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,490
I never intended to persuade you to leave.

35
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,240
Didn't we agree

36
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,999
to never be apart?

37
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,920
Mother, you finally received
this lamp from your son-in-law.

38
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,079
My mom has known your name for a long time.

39
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,920
The lamp burned so brightly,
so she must be very pleased with you.

40
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,439
Of course, where else could you find
such a smart and charming husband like me?

41
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,239
Arrogant much?

42
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Please forgive us, Great Monk.

43
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,360
It's fine. You accidentally
knocked down this batch.

44
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,679
It must be fate.
Would you like to interpret the stick?

45
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,960
Sure.

46
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:57,711

47
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,896

48
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,079
The excellent fortune is for you. Take it.

49
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,559
As husband and wife,
we should share the same fortune.

50
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,759
Let's interpret this one.

51
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,040
Should we tie one
and bind our marriage even tighter?

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,280
Bind it for several lifetimes.

53
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,240
When I lit the lamp, I had already made a wish.

54
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,639
We are destined to be together for all lifetimes,
so why waste this unnecessary money?

55
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,439
There is no one more stingy than you.
You don't even want to spend this kind of money.

56
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
As you wish.

57
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,639
Look, Lady He has done so many good deeds,
but how can her judgment of people be so poor?

58
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,680
- She doesn't let go of such a shameless man.
- That might not be the case.

59
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
She is a merchant good at making money.

60
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,720
I fear the other party is unwilling to let her go.

61
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,519
That makes sense.

62
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,040
You two are mistaken.
It's not that he doesn't want to let me go.

63
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,839
I'm the one insisting on staying with him.

64
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,639
But...

65
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,600
My wife is so clever and sensible in every way,

66
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,000
except she can't let go of her love for beauty.

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,240
She treats me this way
because she covets my appearance.

68
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,759
Yes, my husband is good in many ways,

69
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,319
and his handsome appearance
is the least worth mentioning.

70
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,559
I hope you two will also find
such an ideal husband in the future.

71
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,040
Come on. Drink away, now.

72
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,160
I don't believe you can win every time.

73
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
- I don't believe it, come on.
- Come on, one more time.

74
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
Everyone, get ready. Three, two, one, start.

75
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,480
Here. Look. Here. Now, guess.

76
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,120
- I want to play, too.
- All right, in a moment.

77
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,040
This fist.

78
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
How can you guess correctly every time?
I really am amazed.

79
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,879
- Impressive, impressive.
- All right, pour me some wine.

80
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,679
Pour me some wine.

81
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,439
Ouch, it hurts.

82
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,759
Well, Chuan Yu, you actually cheated.

83
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,159
Why did you do that?

84
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,159
Stop meddling and go eat your cookie.

85
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,200
You two are like a pair of brothers.

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
If it comes to a fight, who would win?

87
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,479
- That would definitely be me.
- Me.

88
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,200

89
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,679
- She Yan.
- She Yan.

90
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,480
Bet on She Yan. We all bet on She Yan.

91
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,559
You guys...

92
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,679
The fruits are here.

93
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,320
- Come on. Come on.
- Here.

94
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,360
Please.

95
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Alright, here we go.

96
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,040
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Come on.

97
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,559
It's happening.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Go. Hit him.

99
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,759
She Yan. She Yan.

100
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,839
- I placed the wrong bet.
- Come on, She Yan.

101
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,279
- She Yan.
- Chuan Yu.

102
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,519
- Go.
- Hold on, Chuan Yu.

103
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,519
- Push him hard.
- Get him.

104
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,640
Be careful of his sneak attack.

105
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,679
Nice.

106
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,039
Well done, She Yan!

107
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,839
Come on.

108
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,519
I want to say something before you go
out of the city tomorrow to deliver goods.

109
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,480
Fu, remember, you must control yourself.

110
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't talk about resorting to fists
at the drop of a hat, you know?

111
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,879
Okay.

112
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:58,000
And also, Chun, you must control your mouth.

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,500
In short, when you are out,
always be careful and protect yourself.

114
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,759
Don't worry, Mu Dan.
We will look after each other.

115
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,159
Right, it's not the first time we're going out.
Why are you acting like it's a farewell?

116
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,799
All right, we'll be back in a couple of days.

117
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,960
Yes, I'm just worried about you.

118
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,240
Then I'll make some delicious food
and wait for your return.

119
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Now, go.

120
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,480
- Let's go.
- See you.

121
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,400
Be careful.

122
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,280
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.

123
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,359
For many years, I only had Chuan Yu
and She Yan as companions.

124
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,960
After meeting you,
not only did my family grow larger,

125
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,199
but I also gained many friends and relatives.

126
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,879
When I was trapped in the Liu Mansion,

127
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,319
I never thought that today,
I could be so happy and content.

128
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,120
You've done so much for me and given me so much.

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,000
I cannot lose.

130
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,359
The hollow box.

131
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,120
This is our tied-together hair.

132
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,959
If it's a love token, how could it miss this?

133
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,519
You kept that copper coin.

134
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,960
You were the first one to discuss business
with the Floral Envoy with just a copper coin.

135
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,959
At that time, I knew that you'd succeed
in whatever you intend to do.

136
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,679
Could it be that you liked me since then?

137
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,279
How can I know when I started to like you?

138
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,640
But that night, even though you were injured,
your eyes were still determined and strong.

139
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,640
I knew from then on
that I'd remember them for a lifetime.

140
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:18,044
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

141
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:22,204
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

142
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:26,172
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

143
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:31,068
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

144
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:36,096
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

145
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:40,382
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

146
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:44,288
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

147
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:49,868
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

148
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
This is mine.

149
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,240
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

150
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,839
In one's life, what remains deep down
are just some moments.

151
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,479
My every moment with you is stored here.

152
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,520
No matter what happens tomorrow,
I will have no more regrets.

153
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:27,040
 ♫ If the rainbow light is kind ♫

154
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,120
Mu Dan, are you afraid?

155
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,800
No, I just still have many regrets.

156
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,200
I have not yet traveled
all over this vast land with you.

157
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,280
I have not yet tasted all the delicacies with you.

158
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,600
Jiang Chang Yang, no matter what happens tomorrow,

159
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
you must take care of yourself.

160
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,280
Remember that I am waiting for you.

161
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:22,144

162
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,359
Cao Zhi was repeatedly suspected and persecuted,
which is how he wrote the Nine Sorrows Rhapsody.

163
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,279
Zi Jian's rhapsodies are rich in words
and have a unique style.

164
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,599
It's common to speak honestly and get dismissed,
but I believe I've never failed my emperor.

165
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,799
People's opinions and actions vary,
and they are evaluated differently.

166
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,079
Those who compete in foolishness for personal gain
fear our dedication to public service.

167
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,079
Those who conspired in factions envied my virtue
and drove me across the Yangtze River.

168
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,480
The ones with great forces can do as they please,
and I feel sorry for my miserable life.

169
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,640
My worries never end,
and constant sorrows surround me.

170
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,640
I haven't been back in the capital for years,
and I am so far away from my emperor.

171
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,799
Riding the wandering dragon,
flaunting the emerald and splendid banners.

172
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,559
I follow the correct path of my father,
and how could I take deviant paths?

173
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,319
I know offending the emperor calls for blame,
but I am ashamed to flatter for favor.

174
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:28,960
You are mere new scholars, yet at the banquet,
you recite this melancholy, ominous rhapsody.

175
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
It's truly wanton and unrestrained.

176
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,359
This is just a rhapsody by an ancient person.

177
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,359
How could this be?

178
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,159
How could this be?

179
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,879
Are you so afraid, Captain Pei?

180
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
Master.

181
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,960
Master Xu.

182
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Master.

183
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,319
Master, you are still alive.

184
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,960
Do you remember which poem of Cao Zhi's
I favored the most?

185
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,319
Throwing my body at the end of a sharp blade,
how can life be preserved?

186
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,839
I couldn't think about my parents,
let alone my children and wife.

187
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,240
Now that I have enlisted,
I cannot consider personal matters.

188
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,440
I'll sacrifice myself for national peril
and regard death as going home.

189
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Good.

190
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,399
Your Majesty.

191
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Your Highness, it has been
a long time since we last met.

192
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,559
County Princess, for the past two days,
Taoguang Courtyard has prepared women's garments.

193
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,520
Tonight, wine and bathing items
were also prepared.

194
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,960
For He?

195
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes.

196
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,759
Zi Shu is crazy.

197
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,799
Jiang Chang Yang will not let her go,
and He herself would not agree to it.

198
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,640
Jiang Chang Yang is still the Floral Envoy,
but his influence is not as great as before.

199
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,319
If He wants to climb up the ladder...
County Princess, do not be deceived by her words.

200
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,440
Prepare the carriage.

201
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,240
Yes.

202
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,839
I've long waited for General Yu,
but an old friend has arrived.

203
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,359
I must toast your resurrection with this wine.

204
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,680
Master Xu, unfortunately, I just poured this wine.

205
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,200
Master, what exactly is going on here?

206
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,839
Prince Ning sent someone to assassinate me,
so I had no choice but to die.

207
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:30,599
Fortunately, Sui Zhi saved me,
and that's why I am able to stand here today.

208
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:37,280
Sui Zhi, so it's true.
You've been acting all along.

209
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,039
We have meticulously prepared this grand drama
for you for many years, Your Highness.

210
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,639
Please, graciously accept it.

211
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Your Majesty.

212
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Your Majesty, Prince Ning
is in control of the Ministry of Revenue,

213
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,319
smuggling, embezzling the national treasury,
and undermining the foundation of the state.

214
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,680

215
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,480
Your Majesty.

216
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,519
Prince Ning forms factions for personal gain,

217
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,440
colludes with clans to buy
and sell official positions,

218
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
withholds taxes, and seizes citizens' lands,

219
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,240
causing countless people to be homeless
and the populace to live in misery.

220
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:30,599
Your Majesty, Prince Ning illicitly
establishes a weaponry workshop,

221
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,640
raises assassins, and harms loyal ministers.

222
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,456
He exterminated the entire family of Minister Lu.

223
00:24:35,456 --> 00:24:37,256

224
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,440
For his selfish greed,
Prince Ning disregards millions of subjects,

225
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,920
seeks power for himself, slaughters colleagues,
and acts in defiance of laws and traditions.

226
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
He spies on the private matters of Your Majesty,

227
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
controls the government,
and brings calamity to the nation.

228
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,040
The great fire in Mengzhou that year
was an attempt to assassinate you.

229
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,359
Every single action defies the heavens
and violates natural order.

230
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,000
He is guilty of heinous and unforgivable crimes.

231
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,039
Such an unkind and unjust person,
the epitome of great treachery and evil,

232
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,599
should be stripped of power,
removed from position, imprisoned, and executed,

233
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,760
in order to give an explanation
to all the people of the nation.

234
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,519
I suppose, Your Majesty,
you are the one behind this feast of spite.

235
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,839
Now that things have come to this point,
shouldn't you say something?

236
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,759
With your malicious crimes, you deserve to die.

237
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,200
Ning, do you acknowledge your crimes?

238
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,359
Your Majesty, you must have waited patiently
for so many years for this day, have you not?

239
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,240
But these people

240
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:08,440
are either lacking in foundation
or still immature.

241
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,119
Do you truly believe

242
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,839
that they can, by merely raising their arms,
convict me of crimes?

243
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,440
Everyone, heed my command:
capture the traitor, and eliminate the villain.

244
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,279
Don't run! You also
formed factions for personal gain.

245
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,079
Sit down, you.

246
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Prince Ning, do you confess your sins?

247
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:51,000
What difference does it make
whether I confess or not?

248
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,839
Yu Zheng, son of General Yu, and the Hedong Army
are stationed outside Chang'an city.

249
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,919
He is ready to provide support at any time.

250
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,160
And as for General Yu Chang,
he should now have reached Prince Ning's Mansion.

251
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,359
By the imperial decree,
he is to search the premises.

252
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,250
You only have an incense stick's worth of time.

253
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,160
If you kneel and confess now,

254
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,559
His Majesty may spare the lives of your kinsmen,
punishing only the direct offender.

255
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,720
But if you refuse to repent,

256
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,000
by the time the incense burns out, the Hedong Army
should arrive here with the confiscated evidence.

257
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,760
Then, your followers will be executed on the spot,
for their crimes are unforgivable.

258
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,960
Time doesn't wait for anyone,
and you're the one who needs to repent.

259
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,399
Men from Prince Ning's Mansion.

260
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,599
- Chuan Yu, get Mu Dan out of here!
- Mr. Jiang.

261
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,520
Make sure she's safe. Go!

262
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,359
Protect Master Xu. Protect Master Xu.

263
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,720
Be careful.

264
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,200
Master, let's go. I will take you away, let's go.

265
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,960
For those who recognize the times
and are willing to submit,

266
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,720
I will not pursue past grievances.

267
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,000
Those who persist in their errors
and resist to the end,

268
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,359
will be killed without question.

269
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

270
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,879
I am one of Prince Ning's men.
I sincerely submit to Prince Ning.

271
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,000
Rat.

272
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,200
Zhang Qian, take the Master and leave.

273
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,079
Sui Zhi, be careful.

274
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,359
Master.

275
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,079
Mr. Jiang.

276
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,920
Jiang Chang Yang, you have already lost.

277
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920

278
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,559
The fire at the examination hall completely
burned away His Highness' trust in you.

279
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,159
In order to ascertain the day of your revolt,
we found Zhang Qian.

280
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,919
If someone can rise to power in one step,
no one will bypass the shortcut.

281
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:11,680
Do those so-called loyalists around His Majesty
have no weaknesses?

282
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,559
The more they value loyalty and justice,
the harder it is to give up their loved ones.

283
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,000
You lost because you weren't ruthless enough.

284
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,879
Prince Ning devised this plan in just a few days.

285
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,319
I'm afraid the estrangement with the aristocracy
was also a deliberate act for us to see.

286
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,079
You have acted for so long.

287
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,359
Being fooled by His Highness in the end
can be considered a reciprocal courtesy.

288
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,568
There are no close relatives in my residence.

289
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:19,040
All that's left are the household servants
and enough gunpowder.

290
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,960
Judging by the blaze, Yu Chang
and his elite soldiers won't make it to Hedong.

291
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:38,800
Your Majesty, Sui Zhi, listen.

292
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,720
Do you hear their cries and screams
in the raging fire?

293
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,840
Who sent you? Where are you taking me?

294
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,000
Make it clear.

295
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
My lord does not want you to perish here.

296
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,079
Is your lord Liu Chang? Is it Liu Chang?

297
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,920
My lady, stop struggling and come with us.

298
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,119
This is a misunderstanding.
If it's Liu Chang, it's fine.

299
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,800
I don't want to die here either. I will go myself.

300
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,120
Let go, let go of me. I will walk myself.

301
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,399
You should have said it earlier.

302
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,039
Your Majesty is unkind,
yet I must consider the bond between brothers.

303
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,680
I'll use utmost benevolence
to conquer utmost malevolence.

304
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,480
As for Jiang Chang Yang, he has been mingling
with vile elements, forming wicked factions,

305
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,519
deceiving the emperor, plotting rebellion,
and slaughtering colleagues.

306
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,039
Your Majesty, how do you think
he should be punished?

307
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,800
I owe the royal family a life,
and I should have returned it a long time ago.

308
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,360
Sui Zhi.

309
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Mr. Third, do you remember
the promise you made to me?

310
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,440
 Precisely because we are like brothers,
you should put righteousness above loyalty.

311
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,720
 If such danger arises again,
Your Majesty must let go of me.

312
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,800
Jiang Chang Yang, Jiang Chang Yang.

313
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,959
Jiang Chang Yang, Jiang...

314
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,640
Jiang Chang Yang.

315
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,359
I will accompany you and watch
Jiang Chang Yang die right here.

316
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,560
Sui Zhi, I can't do it. I can't.

317
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:43,414
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

318
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,392
 ♫ How much of the past does it hold ♫

319
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:49,804
 ♫ Falling into your eyes ♫

320
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,195
 ♫ Melting and flowing with you ♫

321
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:55,974
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

322
00:39:55,974 --> 00:40:00,588
 ♫ These billowing waves for ten thousand miles ♫

323
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:01,920
 ♫ Can they eventually ♫

324
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,682
 ♫ Touch the clear skies ♫

325
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:15,328
 ♫ The clouds are hidden in the dark sky ♫

326
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:19,039
 ♫ How can they drift ♫

327
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,444
 ♫ To their anchor ♫

328
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:29,344
 ♫ The moonlight is dim on my shoulder ♫

329
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:34,688
 ♫ Longing seeps out of the silk dye ♫

330
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:37,197
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

331
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:40,995
 ♫ A lifetime of solitude is nothing ♫

332
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,547
 ♫ Yet you are the light ♫

333
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:47,264
 ♫ Piercing through my heart ♫

334
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:49,624
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

335
00:40:49,624 --> 00:40:54,240
 ♫ A candle flickers ♫

336
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,616
 ♫ Never speaks ♫

337
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,888
 ♫ But for you ♫

338
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:02,016
 ♫ I go forward ♫

339
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,400
The Floral Envoy is quite resilient. Verify it.

340
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
Yes.

341
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,280
He has stopped breathing.

342
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,039
Mr. Jiang. Mr. Jiang.

343
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,976
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

344
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:34,784
 ♫ Traversing dangers is not in vain ♫

345
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,157
 ♫ There are thousands of thoughts ♫

346
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:41,120
 ♫ My stubborn faith ♫

347
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,360
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

348
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,939
 ♫ Amidst miles of distress, it's never forgotten ♫

349
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,451
 ♫ Flowers bloom and wither ♫

350
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:51,239
 ♫ I only wish that you ♫

351
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,856
 ♫ Remain unscathed ♫

352
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:56,756
 ♫ I've had a hidden life,
like duckweed stricken by the rain ♫

353
00:41:56,756 --> 00:42:00,896
 ♫ I still remember the battle music of Lanling ♫

354
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:07,220
 ♫ I can still hear the war drums today ♫

355
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:32,598
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

356
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:41,012
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

357
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:49,204
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

358
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:57,556
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

359
00:42:57,556 --> 00:43:05,753
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

360
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:13,940
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

361
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:22,356
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

362
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:30,356
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

363
00:43:50,324 --> 00:43:58,508
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

364
00:43:58,508 --> 00:44:05,959
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

365
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:13,945
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

366
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:22,254
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

367
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:30,516
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

368
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:38,772
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

369
00:44:38,772 --> 00:44:47,200
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

370
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:55,200
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
