1
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,000

2
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Release arrows.

3
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,399
Defensive formation!

4
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,960
Charge!

5
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,000
Attack!

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,519
Archers, loose!

7
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,559
Reload and fire!

8
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,800
Form the formation!

9
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,519
Cavalry, charge!

10
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,759
Your Highness.

11
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,839
It seems Yu Zheng
has truly inherited Yu Chang's legacy.

12
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:22,400
50,000 soldiers held out this long.

13
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,439
Add fire oil!

14
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,199
Charge!

15
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,920
They deployed hundreds of crossbowmen
in the beginning.

16
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,560
The Central Army's fire oil consumption
is faster than I thought.

17
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,560
At this rate, Prince Ning's fifty barrels
of fire oil will be depleted by nightfall.

18
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,399
The battlefield aligns perfectly
with your predictions.

19
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,960
We'll raid their rear under the cover
of darkness for a surprise attack.

20
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,480
My lady.

21
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:34,800

22
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,199
The Central Army's flaming arrows
came faster than anticipated.

23
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,600
Mr. Jiang will lead the raid tonight.

24
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,519
Success hinges on this moment.

25
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,879
Reports say Prince Ning's flaming arrows
ravaged the Hedong Army.

26
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,959
Did Mr. Jiang foresee our disadvantage?

27
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,119
Hence, the planned night strike
against Prince Ning.

28
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,680
This raid must proceed
regardless of battlefield developments.

29
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Firstly, capture the leader to cripple the foe.

30
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,519
If Jiang Chang Yang can infiltrate
and capture Prince Ning,

31
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,680
the war could end swiftly,

32
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,239
sparing countless soldiers' lives.

33
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,399
And secondly, the Central Army's camp
between Twin Peaks gives escape routes.

34
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,279
Even if the Hedong Army wins this battle,

35
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,399
Prince Ning could retreat
through the mountain passes.

36
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,680
That terrain favors defense over assault.

37
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,639
He's prepared an exit strategy.

38
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,120
Should he reach Chang'an and twist the narrative,

39
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,319
endless troubles would follow.

40
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,839
Our troops lie concealed at...

41
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,920
Report. Mr. Jiang.

42
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,319
The Central Army halted the flaming arrows,
and crossbowmen were withdrawn.

43
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,319
What of their commanders?

44
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,879
The imperial general and two military governors
are still leading the assaults.

45
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,960
But Prince Ning retreated
to the rear under escort.

46
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,240
Perfect timing.

47
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
He quit the field before nightfall.

48
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,559
Seems like he is overconfident of victory.

49
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,560
Prepare arms! Bring my warhorse!

50
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,360
Yes.

51
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Hide hooves.

52
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes, hide hooves.

53
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,600
- Yes, hide hooves.
- Yes.

54
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,160
Report. General.

55
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,199
What happened?

56
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:45,160
When our light cavalry approached Prince Ning's
main camp, they encountered a crossbowmen ambush.

57
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
Fire oil ignited simultaneously,
and flaming arrows rained down,

58
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,079
all targeting the light cavalry squad.

59
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,160
Mr. Jiang reacted promptly, leading the vanguard
to raise shields and deflect arrows with sabers.

60
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,519
However, many soldiers' clothing
caught fire and horses fell.

61
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,040
Only a dozen men remain in the squad.

62
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,399
Did they retreat according to plan?

63
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes. During the retreat, Mr. Jiang
shot three consecutive arrows at Prince Ning.

64
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
Unexpectedly, Prince Ning used a soldier
as a shield to block the first two arrows.

65
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
The final arrow hit Prince Ning's shoulder.

66
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
How severe is Prince Ning's injury?

67
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
Seeing him retreat to the main camp,
I rushed back to report.

68
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,840
His exact injury remains unclear.

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,400
Crossbow fire persisted during my return.
The squad may not return soon.

70
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,520
Rear units, keep up!

71
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Mr. Jiang, look.

72
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,079
Accelerate return to camp.

73
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,000
Water! Bring more water!

74
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
More water! Fetch more water!

75
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,920
Hurry!

76
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,280
Hurry!

77
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,840
Around three-quarters past the hour of Yin,
shortly after the commander left,

78
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,320
we saw warning smoke rising
in the Central Army's rear.

79
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,240
Then, death warriors
suddenly broke into the east side of our camp.

80
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,960
Mr. Jiang warned never to
underestimate enemies at night,

81
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,480
so we doubled the night guards deliberately.

82
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,679
We quickly captured the death warriors.

83
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:29,240
But two warriors, seeing their failure,
forced their way into the supply tents

84
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440
and set fire to provisions.

85
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,319
The fire was too fierce.
Nearly all stored grains were destroyed.

86
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,799
Did they poison themselves?

87
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,319
Yes. They swallowed poison
after being captured, but we kept one alive.

88
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,919
Any interrogation results?

89
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,200
They were hiding on the east side
of the mountain before the battle began.

90
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,279
Small numbers and hiding in bushes
kept them undetected.

91
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,159
Death warriors said Prince Ning
ordered them to wait for the signal.

92
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,080
When our army weakens,

93
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,200
they'd sneak in to assassinate
our commander, but...

94
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
Our night raid alarmed Prince Ning,
forcing him to improvise.

95
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,600
Warning smoke rose early tonight,
forcing their desperate charge.

96
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,120
These death warriors have been lurking nearby.

97
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Had they attacked when our morale was low,

98
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,360
the consequences would be dire.

99
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,639
Now, with Prince Ning's sudden order
and our tight camp security,

100
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,040
we have actually minimized the danger.

101
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,559
This was Prince Ning's
final assassination strategy.

102
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,480
However, Prince Ning's current panic
has prematurely revealed his hidden plans.

103
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,839
This may not necessarily
be bad news for the Hedong Army.

104
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,720
However, our night raid failed to capture him,

105
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,320
and this battle may likely drag on longer.

106
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
Mr. Jiang, you mustn't blame yourself.

107
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,759
If Prince Ning becomes desperate, it will directly
impact the main battlefield situation.

108
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,000
The Hedong Army still has hope.

109
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,200
Our initial strategy for a quick victory
is now compromised by lost provisions.

110
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,959
Even the bravest Hedong warriors
cannot fight hunger and cold indefinitely.

111
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,320
Recheck our remaining grain reserves
to determine how many days they'll last.

112
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,359
Starting tomorrow, portion sizes
will be halved at every meal.

113
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,520
We must defend the Dongwei Pass at all costs.

114
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,959
Yes!

115
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:47,240

116
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,730
Madam, Mr. Jiang has instructed me

117
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,200
that if an accident occurs, I must take you all
and leave Hedong for Xinluo as soon as possible.

118
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,799
The cargo ships are docked. We'll depart tonight.

119
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,799
I will ensure your safety and well-being.

120
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,080
If the empire falls into chaos
with the people suffering...

121
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,639
How can any Tang citizen
speak of safety and well-being?

122
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,919
But men need food, and horses need fodder.

123
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:17,159
If this war prolongs, wouldn't the Hedong Army
be driven to extinction?

124
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,400
Prince Ning secured his own escape route.
But what about us?

125
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,519
The Hedong Army's camp
backs against the Fan River.

126
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,240
If we can't win, could we escape by boat?

127
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,759
Yu Zheng and Jiang Chang Yang aren't cowards.
They'd never flee battle.

128
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,320
Moreover, Prince Ning has smeared
the Hedong Army as rebels.

129
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,600
Fleeing would confirm these false accusations.

130
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,520
What would become of the Hedong civilians then?

131
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,639
The Hedong Army
stands ready to die honorably in battle.

132
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,520
They wouldn't prepare escape vessels in advance.

133
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,679
We have cargo ships
that can carry thousands of tons.

134
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,039
If we load provisions and transport them
to the Hedong Army...

135
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you suggesting we cross the Fan River?

136
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,559
But the camp lies on the southwest bank.

137
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,919
Crossing would require
sailing upstream against the current.

138
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,440
The Fan River is wide with treacherous rapids.

139
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,679
If we encounter hidden reefs or rough waves,
we could die and vanish without a trace.

140
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,000
But if successful, delivering provisions
could turn the tide for the Hedong Army.

141
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,559
It would significantly
improve our chances of victory.

142
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,479
I await your orders, Madam.

143
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,639
I'll immediately inventory our stored grain.

144
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,639
I'll have the crew
load the provisions onto the ships.

145
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,919
Wait, this won't be enough.

146
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,759
Yun Niang, take people to borrow grain
from Hedong shops using promissory notes.

147
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,600
- Grain, fodder, collect whatever's available.
- Understood.

148
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,320
Remember to stamp our shop seal
and promise tenfold repayment.

149
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
Slow down.

150
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
Ms. Feng.

151
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,559
Mr. Yang? What brings you here?

152
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,919
This fishing boat belongs to my father-in-law.

153
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,240
Though not large, it can still
carry over a dozen dan of millet.

154
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,639
Furthermore, the northern regions are cold.

155
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,120
The soldiers exposed to the elements
are prone to catching colds.

156
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,039
I've brought medicinal soups and pills
for the Hedong Army as emergency supplies.

157
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,000
The turbulent Fan River makes crossing perilous.

158
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,360
I appreciate your kindness,
but please, don't take further risks.

159
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,840
It's fine, you drove away
the Juebei bandits for us,

160
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,080
then guided us to prosper through commerce,
ensuring ample food and clothing.

161
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,120
Now it's our turn to repay you.
Don't refuse our help.

162
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,919
Moreover, Hedong faces a crisis
and General Yu is fighting on the battlefield.

163
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,120
We Hedong citizens can't stand idly by!

164
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,519
Exactly! That's right.

165
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,120
Ms. Feng, you set an example of integrity
and righteousness as a merchant.

166
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Though not from Hedong, you are willing
to take risks and deliver provisions for our army.

167
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,519
How could we locals
not contribute to our frontline soldiers?

168
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,040
- Exactly!
- Let's all do our part!

169
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,120
In that case, I gratefully accept your assistance.

170
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,559
Fu, load the ships.

171
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,879
- Yes!
- Loading now!

172
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,879
Come with me.

173
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,440
- Come, pass me one!
- Over here!

174
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
- Careful, the deck's slippery!
- Ms. Feng.

175
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,120
My wife preserved many pickles.
They'll arrive shortly.

176
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Thank you. Thank you.

177
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,080
Ms. Feng, our shop has prepared
a small cargo vessel too.

178
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,799
It can carry substantial grain.
Our staff will deliver it soon.

179
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,039
Excellent, thank you.

180
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,320
You're welcome. Let's go.

181
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,120
Thanks.

182
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,799
Mr. Jiang, Prince Ning's flaming arrows
are coming incessantly.

183
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,960
We're running out of even rice gruel.
This can't continue...

184
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,000
Order the light cavalry to prepare arms
and assemble in 15 minutes.

185
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,759
Do you intend to lead the charge personally?

186
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,200
Mr. Jiang, you've lived in Chang'an for years
without battlefield experience.

187
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,480
I may lack Yu Zheng's military prowess,
but I have martial skills.

188
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Each enemy slain is a life saved for our side.

189
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,759
Two kills mean double the gain!

190
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,480
- Mr. Jiang...
- The night raid strategy failed.

191
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,719
With General Yu fighting at the front,
how can I hide in camp like a spectator?

192
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,680
Understood, sir.

193
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,480
Report!

194
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,559
Suspicious boats sighted
on the Fan River behind camp!

195
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,440
Look! We've arrived!

196
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,159
Mu Dan!

197
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,559
This shipment contains rice, flour,
and pickles made by Hedong locals.

198
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,400
It can sustain the troops for two to three days.
I'll find more if needed.

199
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Thank you so much.

200
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Tell the soldiers that the people
of Hedong stand with them.

201
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
Urge them not to lose heart.
We await their victorious return!

202
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,960
What's this?

203
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Thank you.

204
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,079
Of course, Lady He.

205
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,960
Fu, Mr. Yang's small fishing boat has no shelter.

206
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,279
If we encounter waves and collisions,
these grains will definitely get damp.

207
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,079
Return to the shop and bring the Juebei
fire-resistant cloth we stored to cover them.

208
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,000
This will help waterproof and protect the grains.

209
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,079
If the boat rocks and accidentally
knocks over oil lamps or torches,

210
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,079
it can also prevent flames
from reaching the provisions.

211
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,480
Alright, I'll go get it.

212
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,280
Go ahead.

213
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Fu,

214
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,599
did I say fire-resistant cloth?

215
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,240
Yes, we still have some stockpiled. Why?

216
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
The night raid failed due to fire attacks.

217
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,319
If we make protective gear
from these tough fireproof fabrics...

218
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,960
Protective gear? I'll fetch them.

219
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,760
Hurry!

220
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Our warehouse holds much fire-resistant cloth
from trade with the Juebei Kingdom.

221
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,720
But these cloths are mainly sold
to taverns and kitchens in small sizes.

222
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,559
So I led the Hedong villagers
to stitch the fabrics overnight,

223
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,519
sewing them into large combat cloaks.

224
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,640
We also made face curtains
and chest armor for the warhorses,

225
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,359
specifically designed to counter fire attacks.

226
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,200
I increased the material usage
based on sizing comparisons.

227
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,039
When worn, they can withstand frontal flames.

228
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,119
They won't hinder soldiers
from controlling reins or riding.

229
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,680
Reorganize the cavalry without serious injuries
and prepare for a second night raid.

230
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Light torches and approach the warhorses.

231
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,632
Accustom them to flames
to prevent panic when encountering firewalls.

232
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:28,160
Yes.

233
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,359
Where is Prince Ning now?

234
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,559
Frontline scouts report Prince Ning
is still recuperating in camp.

235
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,400
We must race against time and reach
the Central Army's rear before dawn.

236
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Understood.

237
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,319
Report! An enemy squad
was detected ten li from our main camp.

238
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,520
They are approaching rapidly.

239
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Overestimating themselves.

240
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,720
Your Highness is truly farsighted.
Jiang Chang Yang indeed won't give up easily.

241
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,039
Ignorant brat! Like an egg striking a stone.

242
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,920
How's the preparation?

243
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,319
Rest assured, Your Highness.

244
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:10,359
The trenches are now refilled with fire oil.
They'll surely perish in flames.

245
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:15,720
Make it swift this time. Leave no survivors.

246
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,599
Bring me Jiang Chang Yang's head when you return.

247
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,399
Yes!

248
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
Release arrows.

249
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,520
Again!

250
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,920
Summon the cavalry!
Don't let them approach His Highness.

251
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,359
Inform the frontline troops to return
for reinforcement immediately.

252
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,159
Understood!

253
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,399
You're quite adaptable, aren't you?

254
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:28,119
Jiang Chang Yang, what does it matter
if you've knocked down my army's banner?

255
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,839
The Hedong Army has fewer than 500,000 soldiers.
You won't hold out much longer.

256
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,119
Prince Ning, your army's banner has fallen,
and communications have been severed.

257
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,720
Why must you persist in your futile resistance?

258
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,359
These remaining troops
guarding the rear are already in disarray.

259
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,279
Do you really expect them to win and rescue you?

260
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:55,079
Fine, let's keep dragging this out then.

261
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,200
Until the Hedong Army is wiped out.
What do I have to fear?

262
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,519
I am His Majesty's elder brother.
What can you possibly do to me?

263
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,559
Moreover, you're the rebel here.

264
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,359
It's true you're His Majesty's brother,
but who's the real traitor remains unclear.

265
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,399
By His Majesty's decree,
all soldiers heed the command!

266
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,720
Prince Ning Li Xian has slandered the Hedong Army.

267
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,839
He persecuted loyal officials
and conspired to rebel.

268
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,720
His treacherous heart deserves execution.

269
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,319
Military Governor Yu Zheng of Hedong
is ordered to apprehend the rebel.

270
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:48,200
Those who resist shall be deemed accomplices
and executed immediately.

271
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,800
Prince Ning is the true traitor to the nation!

272
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,039
The fundamental nature
of this battle has now shifted.

273
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,400
No.

274
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,639
It's all over.

275
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,119
No!

276
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,240
Central Army troops, listen!

277
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,039
You've never been
a righteous force quelling rebellion.

278
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,079
His Majesty's decree has arrived.

279
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:21,640
Continued resistance will fully brand you
as treasonous scoundrels

280
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,639
to be executed without pardon.

281
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:26,759
Let's go.

282
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,640
Come back!

283
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,720
Don't fall for his lies. Return!

284
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,039
Prince Ning, you've always looked down
on merchants and women.

285
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,879
But do you know who delivered this decree?

286
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,680
General Yu and his son are loyal to the throne.
They'll never submit to Prince Ning.

287
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,839
War between them is inevitable.

288
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:49,359
I must give the Hedong Army
a legitimate justification.

289
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,599
It'll prove at the frontline
that Yu Zheng fights to protect the sovereign.

290
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,240
But they must win this battle.

291
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,800
Only through victory does this become
His Majesty's true edict.

292
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,919
If we lose, it becomes worthless scrap.

293
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,599
The camellias are blooming splendidly.

294
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,159
The azaleas here are also quite beautiful.

295
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,760
The wind's picking up.
Be careful not to catch a cold.

296
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,119
Since all's quiet in the capital,
you should return to Hexi soon.

297
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,159
Take care, Noble Consort.

298
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,480
Do you think waving this so-called decree
will shake my army's morale?

299
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,079
The authenticity of this decree
remains unverified.

300
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,960
Soldiers! A general in the field
may disregard imperial orders.

301
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,159
Here, you obey me!

302
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,160
Jiang Chang Yang, I ask you this.

303
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,880
With less than 500,000 troops,
how can you possibly defeat me?

304
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,599
Even if you capture me now,

305
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,279
the Hexi Army and Jiannan Army
won't stand idly by.

306
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,079
To prove they're not rebels,
they'll fight to the death to save me.

307
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,119
Boy, remember this.

308
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,599
The victor of this war
writes the narrative of justice.

309
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,759
Look. Reinforcements are coming!

310
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,639
My troops have arrived. What did I tell you?

311
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,599
Your Highness!

312
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,399
Li Xian!

313
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,400
It seems justice favors the Hedong Army.

314
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,680
Prince Ning, haven't you always
wanted my list of allies?

315
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:00,599
Today, I formally introduce you
to a crucial ally of mine.

316
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,520
Xiao Wen Yan, you traitorous rat!

317
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:24,440
Soldiers! You are the fiercest
warriors of the Central Plains!

318
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,519
You should share glory and shame
with your commander!

319
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,519
Take up arms! Follow me to retake the capital!

320
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,240
When we succeed,
your descendants will bask in eternal glory!

321
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:47,160
Prince Ning, are you finally
dropping the act and openly rebelling?

322
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,319
So what? Fight! Let the battle commence!

323
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,759
Your Highness, our troops are demoralized,
and we've lost allies.

324
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,160
We can no longer fight.

325
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,920
I misjudged you all along.

326
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,839
Despicable! Repaying kindness with betrayal!

327
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:22,319
You lost not just a leg,
but your backbone and courage!

328
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,000
I merely adapt to prevailing circumstances.

329
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,160
My earlier loyalty followed the greater trend.

330
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,559
Now, my rebellion aligns with the new trend.

331
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,319
My principles remain unchanged.

332
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,279
It's you who no longer
represents the tide of history.

333
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,079
You...

334
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,119
I, Liu Chang, Assistant Minister of War,
voluntarily surrender.

335
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,559
I acknowledge my grave crimes deserve death.

336
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,279
At great risk, I captured the rebel leader.

337
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,920
Prince Ning conspired
to eliminate loyal officials.

338
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I hold evidence of all his crimes.

339
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,200
I'll fully cooperate
with General Yu Zheng's investigation.

340
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,399
Let's purge corrupt officials
and restore imperial order.

341
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,839
Hedong Military Governor Yu Zheng is ennobled
as Prince Jun for quelling rebellion.

342
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,440
You'll remain in the capital
to oversee investigations

343
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,319
and eradicate Prince Ning's faction completely.

344
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,440
I accept this decree.
Thank you for Your Majesty's mercy.

345
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,240
Liu Chang, Vice Minister of War.

346
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
I am here.

347
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,639
A rebel accomplice deserves death.

348
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,200
Yet, your battlefield confession
and capturing enemies are merits.

349
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,640
Given your sincere repentance
and merit-earning surrender,

350
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,410
I'll show leniency.

351
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,000
You'll be stripped of position
with your property confiscated.

352
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,640
But your death sentence is commuted.

353
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,040
I kneel in gratitude, Your Majesty.

354
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,879
Your Majesty, I have one final request.

355
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
Go on.

356
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,639
Your Majesty, I beseech you
to grant County Princess amnesty.

357
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,720
Although she is the daughter of Prince Ning,
she was never involved in the rebellion.

358
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,960
The Li imperial lineage is precious.
The County Princess shares your royal blood.

359
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,599
I implore Your Majesty's mercy to spare her life.

360
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,680
We are but powerless commoners
with neither status nor heirs.

361
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,480
We pose no threat to stir any waves.

362
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,839
May Your Majesty show compassion
befitting the Heavenly Family's benevolence.

363
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,000
 Master, General Yu,

364
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,359
 Brother Zhang Qiu, She Yan,
and all fallen comrades,

365
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,920
 now that calamities have ended and reforms begun,

366
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,839
 may you all rest in peace.

367
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,799
As for your dearest friends,

368
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,909
I shall dedicate myself to protecting them.

369
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,399
Please rest assured.

370
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,119
May Heaven bless
the Great Tang with enduring peace.

371
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,680
Are you truly determined
to abandon the identity of He Wei Fang?

372
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,119
These extraordinary experiences
can't be explained logically to outsiders.

373
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,039
Moreover, the treacherous
Floral Envoy has already perished.

374
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:54,519
Why shouldn't I remain
as this carefree shopkeeper Xiao Hua?

375
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,320
Whether I remain Jiang Chang Yang matters not.
I merely lament losing my Jiang Mansion.

376
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,199
Exactly! Those flower-cultivating soils
I painstakingly nurtured...

377
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:11,079
Why don't we sneak in and steal that soil back?

378
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,559
I'm homeless now,
and you're still obsessing over soil?

379
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,800
A corrupt official should've anticipated this day.

380
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,320
But the Fragrance Garden
has ample space and many rooms.

381
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,879
Pick any chamber you like.
I won't disdain a live-in husband.

382
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,840
Though you left Chang'an, your remaining staff
proved remarkably capable.

383
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,039
Within just over a year,
they managed to reclaim the Fragrance Garden.

384
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,599
With such expanded business,
numerous visitors will come calling.

385
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,239
I must teach you some trickery arts.

386
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,719
Should we encounter old acquaintances,
escaping won't be so awkward.

387
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,639
Keep your petty thieving tricks to yourself.

388
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,559
My silver tongue suffices for protection.

389
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,000
And if that silver tongue gets occupied?

390
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,639
What do you propose?

391
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,199
Taking liberties in broad daylight, aren't you?

392
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,280
Mercy, my lady!

393
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,439
Having left Chang'an so long, I've yearned
for the palace-brewed Mulberry Wine.

394
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
Exhilarating!

395
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,199
Fortunately, Li Xian coveted that allies' list.

396
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,920
Had he truly sought your death...

397
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,280
Without mortal peril,
how could we find hope in desperation?

398
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,079
I should thank his precise bladework,
taking half my life yet sparing a breath.

399
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,959
Having cheated death once,
how can you remain so reckless?

400
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,559
To sacrifice for the nation's crisis,
I meet death as homecoming.

401
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,600
Master's teachings stay with me.

402
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,000
Even had I perished fulfilling duty that day...

403
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,640
I'd have no regrets.
You needn't blame yourself, Your Majesty.

404
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,400
Sui Zhi, you know that.

405
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,079
I never saw you as a subject, but as a brother.

406
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,879
So no matter how you died, I will...

407
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,440
Don't think I don't know what you're scheming.

408
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,200
You want to get me drunk
so I'll grant your request.

409
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,079
Now that power is returned to the sovereign,
peace reigns over land and sea.

410
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,840
Our wrongfully deceased colleagues and the people
of Mengzhou can finally rest in peace.

411
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,800
Now, we'll witness Mr. Third's
grand ambitions unfold.

412
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,079
My childhood wishes are all fulfilled.
One shouldn't be too greedy in life.

413
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,519
You've always been loyal and righteous.

414
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,600
Why not clear your name and restore your status?

415
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,760
Mu Dan and I have complicated identities.

416
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,599
If we publicly return from the dead,
there'd be too much to explain.

417
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,320
It's too much.

418
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,440
Besides, I don't care
about high positions or eternal fame.

419
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,039
If you don't care about family reputation,
what about Mu Dan?

420
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,968
She naturally shares my view.

421
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,880
The empire is vast,

422
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,639
and officials across prefectures
can't monitor everything.

423
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,360
While Mu Dan trades across the lands,
I'll be your watchful eyes.

424
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,720
We'll ensure no corrupt officials or bandits
remain wherever we pass.

425
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,960
You clearly just want to travel
and enjoy life with Mu Dan,

426
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,359
leaving me lonely and desolate.

427
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,080
Mr. Third, dare you repeat
those words before Consort Shu?

428
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,519
Mr. Third.

429
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,160
Sui Zhi.

430
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:03,176

431
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,439
Your shop is reopening soon. Why the long face?

432
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,839
I still don't know
how to tell everyone about leaving.

433
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,719
Rather than face tearful farewells,
how about we slip away quietly?

434
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,480
We'll sneak away on your flower boat...

435
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,079
That won't do!

436
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,760
After finally returning safely,
leaving like that would hurt everyone.

437
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,000
How are the preparations coming along?

438
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,600
Don't worry. Yun Niang's got it.
Everything will be ready soon.

439
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,039
Mr. Lv, come here.

440
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,280
Mr. Lv. Over here, Mr. Lv.

441
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Our previous plan isn't perfect.

442
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,879
What do you think they're doing?

443
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:51,044
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

444
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:59,458
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

445
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:07,650
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

446
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:16,002
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

447
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:24,199
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

448
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:32,386
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

449
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:40,802
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

450
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:48,802
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

451
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:16,954
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

452
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:24,405
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

453
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:32,391
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

454
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:40,700
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

455
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:48,962
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

456
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:57,218
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

457
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:05,646
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

458
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:13,646
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
