00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:28,010

3
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,419

4
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,840
- I knew Miss He was framed by villains.
 - Yes.

5
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,300
Miss He is a good person. I said she wasn't that kind of person.

6
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,900
Xiao Chun, Mu Dan.

7
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,959
 Blinded by greed.

8
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,680
How did you get so injured?

9
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,500
We're fine. Aren't we out safely? Don't cry.

10
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,739
This is the wound medicine Young Master got from Physician Fu. He instructed you to apply it.

11
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,580
I've made some replenishing soup. You and Xiao Chun should get some rest.

12
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Thank you, Young Master Liu. We'll drink it in a bit.

13
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,799
Go on.

14
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,840
Chun'er.

15
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
Father.

16
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,440
I wronged you.

17
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,790
When you were in trouble, I trusted others more than you.

18
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,339
I apologize to you.

19
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:49,580
Through this, I've realized your medical skills are indeed excellent.

20
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:55,099
Shopkeeper He truly cares for you. You've really grown up.

21
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,659
Your judgment of people is better than mine.

22
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,420
I didn't do well.

23
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,099
I don't like needlework, but I pretended to be a refined lady.

24
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,099
I never let you see the real me.

25
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,919
Today, we should celebrate the clearing of false charges. Let's not talk about this.

26
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,740
I don't know what to gift you,

27
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,300
but I remember you said...

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,810
you liked this.

29
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,759
In the future, if you want to practice medicine, go ahead.

30
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,779
As long as you're safe.

31
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,120
Father.

32
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,459
The wind.

33
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,559
The wind.

34
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,739
It's Young Madam who's been released, not you.

35
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,859
Why are you rushing to bathe and change clothes?

36
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:23,060
They say after prison, one should bathe and burn incense to ward off evil spirits.

37
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,580
In Mu Dan's room, all the incense has been lit, and it's filled with fragrance.

38
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,840
I naturally have to cleanse myself before seeing her for good fortune.

39
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,860
Young Master Jiang.

40
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,300
What are you doing here?

41
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,400
You didn't pluck these flowers from Mu Dan's garden, did you?

42
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,940
Rest assured, Young Master Jiang. I bought all these.

43
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,219
How would I dare provoke Sister even a little nowadays?

44
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:03,260
That's good.

45
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,219
In everything, we must respect order. You use this bath first. I'll be going.

46
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,419
I belong entirely to you. What need is there to distinguish between you and me?

47
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,620
Since I married in, you've never spent the night in my room.

48
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,299
How long has it been since we last saw each other?

49
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:26,339
Today, heaven favored me to run into you.

50
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,700
Let me... serve you well.

51
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,219
Lian Zhou, let me tell you the truth.

52
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:42,339
Ever since Mu Dan came along, I haven't been interested in other women.

53
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,500
I know I wronged you during this time.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,899
You can head to the warehouse later and take whatever you like,

55
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,420
all right?

56
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,999
Truly His Highness's adopted daughter, so understanding. I'm leaving.

57
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,539
Why did you bring a brazier up? Aren't you afraid of the fire?

58
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,140
Chuan Yu brought it over.

59
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,439
They say it can ward off evil and dispel filth, and also dry hair.

60
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,940
No need, I'll do it myself.

61
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,739
Your mouth is the only tough part of your whole body.

62
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,380
Does this feel better?

63
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,579
Youâ€™re usually in charge of several shops and handle it all.

64
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:51,339
Only at home, in the quiet of the night, can you have a moment to relax.

65
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,070
Enough.

66
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,480
We were just acting, how did it become so real now?

67
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,900
If the Matchmaker God sees this, he might misunderstand.

68
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,620
If he cuts all your future marriage threads, don't blame me.

69
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:20,820
I'm not interested in love. I don't need the Matchmaker God.

70
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,319
If he really tangles me with someone random, I'll personally sever that red thread.

71
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,179
Don't pull. It has become a dead knot.

72
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,459
Cut it.

73
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,310
Good girl.

74
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,930
Mu Dan, open your mouth.

75
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,839
Mu Dan.

76
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,100
Useless, no matter how much you resemble it, you weren't raised by He Wei Fang.

77
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,419
You've done so much. How can feelings not waver?

78
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:09,539
But she's now the Floral Envoy's. Why torment yourself like this?

79
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,100
The Floral Envoy...

80
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,380
That's right.

81
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,200
Only by toppling Jiang Chang Yang

82
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,150
and leaving He Wei Fang with no support, will she believe that

83
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,419
only I can help her fulfill her long-cherished wish in the world.

84
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:35,819
I don't mean that. County Princess has deep feelings for you. You can'tâ€¦

85
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,419
Young Master.

86
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:44,059
- Young Master.
 - Has something happened?

87
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,380
A stranger has appeared at the dock three times.

88
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,659
I've sent someone to follow him, but we haven't found his whereabouts yet.

89
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,819
Keep a close watch on him and find out who's behind him.

90
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:56,059
Don't let him mess up our business.

91
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,759
Yes, Sir.

92
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,819
Young Madam, your arm injury hasn't healed yet. Let me.

93
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:06,599
No, absolutely not. I can do it. You go ahead.

94
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,939
Where is Zhao Cai going with the flowers?

95
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:19,479
Young Madam, it's to be sent to Madam Lian Zhou's room.

96
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,140
Lian Zhou is now interested in flowers and plants?

97
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,079
Madam Mu Dan, what brings you here?

98
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,939
I'm here to bring insect repellent to Lian Zhou.

99
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,419
Greetings, Young Madam.

100
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:03,360
You can't transplant it like this, here.

101
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,220
When peonies are in full bloom, they can't be transplanted.

102
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,059
Zhao Cai, you never raised flowers before, right?

103
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,419
If you forcibly dig it up like this,

104
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,220
even if the flower survives this spring, it won't bloom next year.

105
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,679
Sister, did you come over today for something?

106
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,579
I see you're growing Dense Misty Purple.

107
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,819
I thought this flower is delicate and easily attracts insects,

108
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:31,220
so I brought you a bottle of insect repellent.

109
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,999
Thank you.

110
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:45,819
Since you're so fond of plants now, why trouble the young lads in the residence?

111
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:50,000
Zhao Cai doesn't understand how to tend to plants. Why not come to me?

112
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,620
I intended to raise them for fun. I didn't know there were so many intricacies involved.

113
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,220
In the future, I'll stick to painting and the zither. I won't trouble you.

114
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,140
Please continue the conversation. I'll excuse myself.

115
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,740
Go ahead.

116
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:26,100
Being confined in the inner mansion likely wastes one's youthful years.

117
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,299
Have you understood what I told you before?

118
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:35,419
Do you want to go out and try a different life?

119
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,240
The life you speak of isn't something everyone is lucky enough to experience.

120
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:50,380
I just saw the packed bag on the table. Are you going out?

121
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,980
I want to stay a few days at Kaiyuan Temple to chant and pray for blessings.

122
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,240
Kaiyuan Temple is a place of austere meditation. Why the sudden desire to go there?

123
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,939
I want to for a blessing regarding my relationship with Young Master.

124
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,539
You're generous, you won't stop me from going, right?

125
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
Of course, I won't.

126
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,299
 That planting soil was shoveled away after Cai Wei's loud reminder.

127
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,500
 What was Lian Zhou discussing with Zhao Cai that required one to guard the door?

128
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,659
 Zhao Cai is a servant of the Jiang Residence. Can Lian Zhou recruit him so easily?

129
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,560
 Zhao Cai.

130
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,880
 Young Master, spare my life.

131
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,220
 You aren't usually one to torment your servants. What's the matter today?

132
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,520
 Do you have a grudge against this lad?

133
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,280
 You guess.

134
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,510
 Jiang Chang Yang puts on a show in the residence

135
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,779
 not just to spread the notoriety of being a playboy.

136
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,819
 It's likely he's being watched from close by.

137
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,720
 Jiang Chang Yang isn't in Chang'an these days.

138
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,460
 If Zhao Cai is really Prince Ning's man, with Lian Zhou suddenly leaving the mansion,

139
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,579
 are they going to act against Jiang Chang Yang?

140
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:45,700
I wanted to go to Kaiyuan Temple to offer incense to my mother. We can go together.

141
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,599
Mu Dan and I are best friends. I'm accompanying her.

142
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,079
Madam, the lights in Madam He's room have already been extinguished.

143
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:04,890
Privately using items reserved for royals is a capital offense.

144
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,970
Are you sure you want to buy?

145
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,419
Madam, your embroidery skills are truly impressive.

146
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,340
Though this Lotus Dress is old, it hasn't lost its beauty.

147
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,559
The lotus flowers on it almost look real.

148
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,699
The embroidery shop my father opened back in the day was the largest in Jiangnan.

149
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,340
I've embroidered countless dresses with my own hands.

150
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:57,459
But now, this is the only piece I can find or purchase.

151
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,979
I've had a wish since I was little.

152
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,520
One day, I hope to wear such beautiful clothes.

153
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,750
Even if just in the dark of night,

154
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,590
I'll wear them just for myself to see.

155
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
But my parents warned me that

156
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,739
merchants aren't worthy of wearing noble attire.

157
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,910
My father was persecuted by a corrupt official later on,

158
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,359
and overnight, my family was ruined.

159
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:47,710
I've never worn such luxurious dresses.

160
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,860
Madam, it truly hasn't been easy for you to get where you are today.

161
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:56,290
Merchants are lowly.

162
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,979
No matter how big their business becomes,

163
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:04,219
a single word from an official can turn everything to dust.

164
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,810
Only by clinging to royal relatives and nobles

165
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,830
can one find a place in the affluent circles,

166
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:17,410
adorned in jewels and fine clothes,

167
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,700
with everlasting peace.

168
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,079
So, Lian Zhou also came from a merchant background.

169
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:44,820
Both of you have gone through many trials, yet have become completely different people.

170
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,359
We were raised under the care of our family.

171
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,019
But what about her? Her family was ruined.

172
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,979
We might not understand the hardships she has experienced along the way.

173
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,540
Presumably, when Lian Zhou was little and desperate, no one gave her a choice

174
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,440
so she could use her embroidery skills to make a living for herself.

175
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,780
A noble person gave her a beautiful cage,

176
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,860
keeping her well-fed and clothed, without worries.

177
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,079
Naturally, she thought that only by aligning with the powerful could she be safe.

178
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,799
In this light, it seems that those who are hateful indeed are pitiful too.

179
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,699
Buying old dresses that nobles don't want to wear before is still a crime.

180
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:36,659
Presumably, over the years, Lian Zhou has been living cautiously out of fear.

181
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:45,359
Just like Sheng Yi, starting over isn't easy.

182
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:53,580
Once she has stayed longer and becomes more familiar with us, she might slowly change.

183
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,659
I hope so.

184
00:21:56,459 --> 00:22:01,459
Let's pretend we didn't see today's events, no one else can know.

185
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,059
Understood.

186
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,680
General.

187
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Sui Zhi, there's no need for formalities.

188
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,580
This courtesy is on behalf of His Majesty, who asked me to come.

189
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,880
A salute for your loyalty and courage, appreciation for guarding Hedong all these years.

190
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,130
I am fearful.

191
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,700
Let His Majesty rest assured.

192
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,060
Even if Fan Yang is on good terms with Prince Ning,

193
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,340
crossing the Yellow River still requires our Hedong Army's approval.

194
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,079
With you here, His Majesty can be at ease.

195
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,599
Over these years, is His Majesty well?

196
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,900
As long as the country is secure, His Majesty will be fine.

197
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,420
General, please rise.

198
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,340
Once the time is right, His Majesty will send a message to Hedong.

199
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:22,200
Please bring the imperial decree and assist His Majesty in setting a solid foundation.

200
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,520
How is the plan? Please elaborate.

201
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:37,280
After the other day, did Madam He have any suspicions?

202
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,979
It's been handled, she hasn't asked about it again.

203
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:47,300
The Minister of Revenue passed away, and the position is vacant.

204
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,380
You need to influence him to get His Highness's man into the position.

205
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,240
Jiang Chang Yang values Lady He highly and won't give me a chance.

206
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,900
How can I influence him?

207
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,559
If Madam He were dead, you wouldn't have to worry about lacking an opportunity.

208
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,979
What? Do you really consider her family now?

209
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,659
Prince Ning's Mansion doesn't keep useless people nor allow betrayal.

210
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:25,320
My status is all thanks to His Highness.

211
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,380
I would never dare forget the favor.

212
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:40,900
Jiang Chang Yang cares about Madam He. If she dies, he'll investigate.

213
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,060
If it leads to you, will you be able to protect yourself?

214
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,680
If it leads to me, how should I explain it to His Highness?

215
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,559
As long as He Wei Fang loses favor, she'll no longer obstruct us.

216
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,419
If you could compete against her, you wouldn't be struggling today.

217
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,580
Before I didn't understand what Jiang Chang Yang liked about her.

218
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,820
Now I see clearly.

219
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,140
Madam He is eloquent and can easily make him happy with her words.

220
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,100
When used in business, this same eloquence can earn a fortune for him.

221
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:31,939
You want to make her mute, taking away her means of living?

222
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:38,459
When he returns, he'll only learn she caught an illness and lost her voice.

223
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:43,000
When he's sad, I'll go to comfort him.

224
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,780
I surely won't disappoint His Highness's great expectations.

225
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,820
I've internalized what you've said.

226
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,610
I want... to learn business with you.

227
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,620
Is that what you truly think?

228
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,019
On the trip to Kaiyuan Temple, I drew a divination.

229
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,620
It said that I have no destiny with Young Master Jiang.

230
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,100
Now I'm resigned,

231
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,680
and I ask for your protection in the future. Help me make more money.

232
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,480
So that I won't be helpless in my old age.

233
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,610
Please rise, quickly.

234
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,499
If you can truly let go of the past,

235
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:40,319
you need not live in fear anymore, and life will only improve.

236
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:50,359
Now that you've come to the Fragrance Garden, everyone and I are your family.

237
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,540
This pair of cups is my apprenticeship gift to you.

238
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,960
Please graciously guide me.

239
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,219
Alright, today, I wanted to try a new wine.

240
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:13,340
You're quite knowledgeable.  Let's taste it together.

241
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,040
Sure.

242
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,620
Fine wine with a good cup. Why not give this a try?

243
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:28,760
This peony cup is truly exquisite.

244
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Come on.

245
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,680
Lian Zhou!

246
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,739
Why have you come?

247
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:43,420
I came to ask Mu Dan to teach me business.

248
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,140
Come on.

249
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,780
The flowers on this cup are beautiful. When did Fragrance Garden purchase them?

250
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,179
It was a gift for Mu Dan. You should try them with the new wine, too.

251
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,699
Come on,today, everyone should have a taste.

252
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:08,380
This is the new wine Jin Niang brewed, see how it tastes.

253
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,159
Come on, Lian Zhou.

254
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,240
The taste is good.

255
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,936
How is it?

256
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:28,980

257
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,179
Everyone, take your leave.

258
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:38,879
Yes.

259
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:47,219
Madam, Fragrance Garden has opened the doors, and the lights are burning.

260
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,039
Lu Geng Chun has already rushed over.

261
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,559
It seems that the poison in Lady He has acted up. Madam, rest assured.

262
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,380
Sister Mu Dan.

263
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,340
She was fine yesterday. What happened today?

264
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,580
Last night, Mu Dan's throat suddenly felt sharp pain and she had difficulty breathing.

265
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,499
After midnight, she couldn't even speak.

266
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,179
Physician Xiao Chun, what illness does she have?

267
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,199
I've used needles and tried medicine, but all to no avail.

268
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,780
I can't determine what the acute illness is.

269
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,900
When Young Master Jiang returns, he'll surely ask Physician Fu to diagnose Mu Dan.

270
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,839
She'll certainly get better.

271
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:53,280
For this throat pain, she should drink more cooling beverages.

272
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,980
Mu Dan.

273
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,419
I was just so worried about Mu Dan that I lost my grip.

274
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:20,580
Quickly throw all these away. Don't let Mu Dan see them and get upset.

275
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,280
Yes.

276
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:03,240
All that should be destroyed has been. You may go.

277
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:13,320

278
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,120
Fifth watch.

279
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,700
Fifth watch.

280
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,300
Young Master, Sister is sick.

281
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,179
She's at Fragrance Garden. Do you want to go see her?

282
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:04,299
Is that so?

283
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:08,780
Sister Lian Zhou.

284
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,300
Why didn't you tell me you returned to the residence?

285
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:29,019
How is your health? Don't force yourself if you're feeling unwell.

286
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:34,540
Health? My health has always been good. I've never been ill.

287
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:41,720
You rushed over so hurriedly. Do you want to have a cup of tea with me?

288
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:55,790
Do you want to ask why I'm standing in front of you unharmed

289
00:32:56,459 --> 00:33:04,300
and why this shattered peony cup is intact here?

290
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:14,259
 Lian Zhou! Why have you come?

291
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,839
 I came to ask Mu Dan to teach me business.

292
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:32,659
Ever since I caught you conspiring with Zhao Cai, I've never let go of my doubts.

293
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:34,659
I always had someone follow you.

294
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:41,680
Unexpectedly, I found out you were making poison to kill me.

295
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,499
Applying it inside the cup's wall, a very delicate method.

296
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:51,459
Unfortunately, before this,

297
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:55,399
I had already bought a pair of identical peony cups.

298
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,580
The one you smashed is non-toxic, while the truly poisonous one

299
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,960
is this in my hand.

300
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:11,100
I did no such thing!

301
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,979
Young Master, it was Madam who coaxed me, saying she would teach me business.

302
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:17,540
That's why I bought the cups and gave them to her, hoping to get closer to her.

303
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,079
These cups aren't rare. You can buy them in any porcelain shop.

304
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,440
How can that serve as evidence?

305
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,060
As for Zhao Cai, I merely asked him to help me move flowers a few times.

306
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,860
Poisoning? I didn't do it!

307
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,760
Is that so?

308
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
Take a look at what this is.

309
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,060
This is the confession of Mister Zhang and Zhao Cai.

310
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,979
They've already confessed and signed it in the government office.

311
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:48,159
 The medicine cured the illness. My master is very satisfied.

312
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,399
 This is the remaining money. In the futureâ€¦

313
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,140
 Behave!

314
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,460
 Don't move.

315
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:23,139
 This poison and contract were found in the geomancer's home.

316
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,700
 Previously, you were only swindling.

317
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,660
 You dare take on making poison to kill people now?

318
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,380
 Spare my life, Madam, Magistrate.

319
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,939
 I know my crime. I've committed a crime!

320
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:38,260
 And you, you've been at the Jiang Residence for years.

321
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,059
 No one discovered you knew martial arts. You hid it well.

322
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:45,579
 What? Do you intend to secretly kill Young Master?

323
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:49,619
 Attempted poisoning of a wife failed. Perhaps it isn't a capital crime.

324
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,699
 But may I ask, Magistrate, if a servant kills the master

325
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,719
 and harms an official, how would it be judged?

326
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,579
 A servant who murders the master shall be beheaded.

327
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,340
 Although I know martial arts, I had no intention of harming Master.

328
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,260
 It was... It's Lian Zhou who sent me. She wants to kill you.

329
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,380
 I don't want to do such a heinous thing, but Lian Zhou forced me.

330
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,280
 Madam, spare my life!

331
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:17,939
 Sir, Lian Zhou was a gift from His Highness to Young Maser Jiang.

332
00:36:17,939 --> 00:36:22,059
 If entrusted to you for disposal, I'm afraid it would cause you difficulties.

333
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,000
 These are internal matters to the Jiang Residence.

334
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,220
 I'll inform Young Master myself when he returns.

335
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,419
 We won't trouble you then.

336
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:33,109
 Thank you for not holding grudges and showing me compassion.

337
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:37,740
 You're truly understanding. The Floral Envoy is truly blessed.

338
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,440
 You flatter me.

339
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,419
 As for these two people, their means are vicious and the evidence is conclusive.

340
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:48,780
 I hope you'll handle it according to the law.

341
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,139
Lian Zhou, I've treated you so well.

342
00:36:56,139 --> 00:37:01,280
Why do you treat me like this? You've truly disheartened me.

343
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,200
Darling, you must stand up for me.

344
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,720
Today, you can poison Mu Dan because of my affection for someone else.

345
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,790
What if you blame me someday,

346
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,900
then what will happen?

347
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,860
Darling, you mustn't! Lian Zhou was a gift from His Highness.

348
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,180
For His Highness's sake, you must not harm her.

349
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,760
All of you, leave.

350
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:06,979
I examined the poison Zhao Cai bought. The dosage is enough to take a life.

351
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:11,539
However, the amount in the cup was carefully calculated.

352
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,419
It would only cause muteness, not death.

353
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:19,399
So, you didn't intend to kill me.

354
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,539
Darling, ultimately, these are matters of the inner courtyard.

355
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:31,820
I have a few words to say to Lian Zhou. Please allow me to handle it myself.

356
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,519
All right, as you wish.

357
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,839
Get up.

358
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,640
Since you entered the residence, you haven't received any sympathy from him.

359
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,480
You feel you've wasted your youth in vain. So you hate me.

360
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,399
I don't blame you.

361
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:16,419
I don't blame you because your conscience is still intact.

362
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:21,839
But you ultimately did something wrong. I can't allow you to stay in the Jiang Residence.

363
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,439
I understand.

364
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:31,039
No matter how you handle this, I have no complaints.

365
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:36,059
What I said to you before was all sincere.

366
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,619
I never intended to compete with you, let alone harm you.

367
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:46,820
The carefree days I mentioned before, perhaps you didn't have a choice before.

368
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:51,859
But today, I want to give you a choice.

369
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,839
What do you mean?

370
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,639
Tomorrow, you can be sent back to Prince Ning Residence.

371
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,699
You might be given to some other noble man.

372
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,899
Though you would lack nothing materially, most likely,

373
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:12,700
you'll still be drawn into endless inner courtyard struggles.

374
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,019
Or... Lian Zhou dies today.

375
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,780
From now on, you will change your name and leave for a distant place.

376
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,979
I'll help you get somewhere surrounded by mountains and rivers.

377
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:35,160
There, you can make a living with your skills and no longer be dependent on anyone.

378
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:44,579
Perhaps there, you'll meet a man who truly cares for you

379
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,359
and live the rest of your life safely and happily.

380
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,139
Love between a man and a woman can't be forced, and I don't want to hinder you.

381
00:40:56,139 --> 00:41:00,999
Since Mu Dan is letting you choose, choose freely.

382
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:26,340
I'll never forget your kindness.

383
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,699
But His Highness's favor towards me is heavy.

384
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:35,350
It's my incompetence that I can't win over his heart. I blame no one.

385
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:38,160
Young Master Jiang.

386
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,340
Please send me back to Prince Ning's Residence.

387
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:59,419

388
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:03,059
Mu Dan has been handed our servant to the authorities.

389
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:08,380
Lian Zhou is your adopted daughter. I can't make the decision on my own.

390
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,839
Thinking it over, it's best to return her to you.

391
