1
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,000

2
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,439
Fresh lamb for sale! Its aroma wafts for miles.

3
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,239
Take a look. You can try it.

4
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,239
It's dark and cloudy. It might start snowing soon.

5
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,359
Let's buy the dates for Fu and hurry back.

6
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,799
Come, have a taste. Take a look.

7
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,880
Fresh fruits and vegetables.

8
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,160
My lady.

9
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
I'll wait here. Be quick.

10
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,439
Yes, ma'am.

11
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,360
Be careful.

12
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,000
Who sent you all here?

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,520
You purposely sent my guard away.
What are you trying to do?

14
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
How did you know?

15
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,439
A thief after money wouldn't ignore my purse

16
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,120
and steal my token of love.

17
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,080
Since you sensed trouble,
why did you send your guard away anyway?

18
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,719
I'm your target.

19
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
If one plan fails, there's always another.

20
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,960
You're truly clever, Miss. It's a pity.

21
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,840
If you don't want bloodshed, come quietly with us.

22
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,640
Move. To the left.

23
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,879
Brave men, is your employer surnamed Liu or...?

24
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:14,040
A mere merchant dared to threaten an official.
You should've seen this coming.

25
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,599
So it's Magistrate Du.

26
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,480
Speak. Where are the stolen goods hidden?

27
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,639
I would love to tell you,
but you can't verify the truth if I tell you now.

28
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,240
Why not let me take you there myself?

29
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,599
Don't play tricks. Just talk.

30
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,719
Lie, and you'll get a new hole in you.

31
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,160
But if I talk now, I'll die faster.

32
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,279
Brave men, how much is Magistrate Du paying you?

33
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,720
I can double it.

34
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,439
Our profession has rules, Ms. Feng.
Save your breath.

35
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,600
Confess cleanly, and you'll suffer less.

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,399
But aren't you here for money?

37
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,439
Just take my money
and tell Magistrate Du I'm dead.

38
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,480
I'll never show up again. How about that?

39
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,160
Boss, the client won't check
the body. We can just...

40
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Rules can't be broken.

41
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,119
Chase her!

42
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Open the door.

43
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Over there.

44
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Open the door.

45
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,199
Open the door.

46
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Open the door.

47
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Open the door.

48
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,960
After reuniting, the first thing Xiao Hua does
is try to murder her husband?

49
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,600
How ruthless!

50
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:39,360
Your skills have improved so much.
Did you learn from Chuan Yu?

51
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:47,519
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

52
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,000
Jiang Chang Yang, you're alive.

53
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,004
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

54
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm not dreaming.

55
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,519
No, I didn't die.

56
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,022
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

57
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:13,928
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

58
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:19,508
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

59
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:27,652
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

60

 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

62
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,479
Let's go home.

63
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:59,723
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

64
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,643
 ♫ Love is boundless ♫

65
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:14,915
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫

66
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:24,808
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

67
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,799
You were stabbed through the heart.
What happened afterward?

68
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,959
How did you survive?

69
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,400
Prince Ning deliberately missed
by half an inch that day.

70
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,679
Prince Ning intentionally spared your life.

71
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,840
He wanted to know how many hidden agents
and secrets His Majesty and I had

72
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,000
over these years.

73
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,340
I was unconscious for a long time.

74
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,080
After waking, Prince Ning treated me well

75
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,120
and promised to release me if I cooperated.

76
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,039
I knew I needed a full recovery
to prepare for the future,

77
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,520
so I pretended to negotiate with him.

78
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,600
 I told him I had hidden guards
who could travel a hundred miles daily

79
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,479
 and their hideouts were known only to me.

80
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,240
 You didn't lie. Carrier pigeons can indeed
fly a hundred miles daily.

81
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,120
 Red-footed carrier pigeons were my summons.

82
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,559
 Carrier pigeons.

83
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:10,040
 Wherever my hidden guards were in the city,
they'd see this signal by looking up.

84
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,280
 Mr. Third would also know
I'm alive upon seeing it.

85
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,120
 How could Prince Ning tolerate
being tricked like this?

86
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,759
 Did they torture you?

87
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,559
 Ci.

88
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,199
 They threw a few punches. I'm tough, no harm done.

89
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,000
Soon after, Mr. Third found an excuse
to summon Prince Ning to the palace.

90
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Yun Niang's team rescued me during the night
when his mansion was leaderless.

91
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,080
After regrouping my forces,
I immediately set out for Hedong.

92
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,639
I learned you weren't with the Xiao family
but went to see Auntie,

93
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
so I rushed here to meet you.

94
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,120
Were your injuries severe?

95
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,040
No.

96
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,799
Your chest was pierced through. You almost died.

97
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,799
Then you endured torture.

98
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:41,256
If not severe, you'd have rushed here
immediately after escaping.

99
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:46,679
A fast horse to Hedong would take over ten days.

100
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,079
Yet you've only just arrived now.

101
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,479
Nothing escapes Xiao Hua's notice.

102
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,760
Let me see your wound.

103
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,519
It's been a long time.
Isn't it improper to undress upon meeting?

104
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,479
Do as I say. Let me see it so I can be at ease.

105
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,920
It's all in the past. The pain has long subsided.

106
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,039
Back then, I kept thinking of you.

107
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,240
Holding onto the thought
that we'd reunite someday made it bearable.

108
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:33,039
But you witnessed me die.
It must have been unbearable for you.

109
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,880
What's past no longer matters.
What matters most is our future.

110
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:54,280
From now on, we'll never be apart.

111
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,439
Jiang Chang Yang, rest assured.
I will protect you no matter what.

112
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,159
As your husband, I'm now penniless
yet still leading a group of hidden guards.

113
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,400
I'll have to rely on your support from now on.

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,720

134
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,940
Prince Ning sent covert searchers.

135
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,359
To prevent him from finding out I'm in Hedong,

136
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:07,599
I've divided my men into multiple groups,
each containing a decoy impersonating me.

137
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,160
They're heading to territories governed
by military governors who allied with Prince Ning.

138
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,279
You aim to divert Prince Ning's attention
and sow distrust among his allies.

139
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,799
That's one purpose.

140
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,639
Over the years, I've uncovered numerous
dark secrets of various military governors.

141
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,640
All are Prince Ning's associates.
Yours isn't among them.

142
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,520
My father and I fear no investigations.

143
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,720
This evidence can trigger internal conflicts
in Shuo Fang and Fan Yang.

144
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,319
Once they turn against each other,
they'll have no capacity to aid Prince Ning.

145
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,000
No wonder my father constantly praises you.

146
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
You sure are cunning and resourceful.

147
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,000
General, you should read
beyond military strategies occasionally.

148
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,079
General, Ms. Feng requests an audience.

149
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,760
- Please, let her in.
- Yes.

150
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,879
General Yu.

151
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,928
The goods have been inventoried and stored.

152
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:03,200
As Winter approaches,

153
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,799
inform me promptly
if you require additional supplies.

154
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,440
I can arrange one more shipment
before the river freezes.

155
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,000
On the day Sui Zhi fled,

156
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,559
he sent someone to inventory
Prince Ning's weaponry workshop.

157
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,160
I've compiled a list cross-referencing
Prince Ning's military forces.

158
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,440
It contains some rare items.
I'll have to trouble you with this, my lady.

159
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,280
Rest assured, General.
I'll find every item for you.

160
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,240
Mr. Jiang, dinner is ready.

161
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,040
It's been days since we reunited.
Why are you still looking at me like that?

162
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,920
When I sparred with She Yan before,
we always tied.

163
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,656
But in the final match,
he sacrificed his life for you,

164
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:18,024
yet I failed to protect Madam.

165
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,919
Please punish me, Mr. Jiang.

166
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,720
Rise. All lives hold equal value.

167
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,520
I never wanted any of you
to trade your lives to save others.

168
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,640
Get up quickly now.

169
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,160
Now you're my future brother-in-law
and Jiang Chang Yang's relative by marriage.

170
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,640
Don't speak such formal words between us anymore.

171
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,960
Come on, sit down.

172
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,920
Mu Dan is right.

173
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,720
I heard you postponed marrying Fu
during my mourning period.

174
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,800
Once this settles down, return to Chang'an
and propose your marriage to Ms. Sun immediately.

175
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:20,064

176
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
This is cold. I'll heat
fresh food for you tonight.

177
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,720
This can be used for firewood. Let's go.

178
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,599
Don't think you can gloss this over.

179
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,800
Why would you pick such a terrible name for me?

180
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,760
You know, you said the same words
to me in my dreams.

181
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,800
Do I often appear in your dreams?

182
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
What else did I say in the dream?

183
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,880
You were just as shameless as you are now,

184
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,520
always saying things
I didn't want to hear to provoke me.

185
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,079
Where are they?

186
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,039
Ladies, Chuan Yu
went to deliver goods to the warehouse.

187
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,359
I haven't seen the shopkeeper.

188
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,119
I heard Madam Feng wept
when the shopkeeper returned.

189
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,920
Then the shopkeeper retreated to her room
and hasn't come out since.

190
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Thank you.

191
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,520
Perhaps visiting Hedong
stirred up painful memories?

192
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,960
Let's go.

193
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,000
Whenever I dreamt of you,
you always told me to forget you.

194
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,039
I would answer "Fine."

195
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,399
If you want me to forget you,
then cut out my heart.

196
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Because you've already taken root in my heart.

197
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,480
Only by removing my heart
could I possibly forget you.

198
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,200
Every time I woke up,
I thought your soul had entered my dreams.

199
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,039
Otherwise, why would the dream version of you
be as stubborn as the real you?

200
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:43,208
Mu Dan, did Fu and Chun not
speak with you these past months?

201
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:47,680
Jiang Chang Yang, are you saying I talk too much?

202
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,559
I wouldn't dare.

203
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:57,520
When I was unconscious,
you kept me company through dreams.

204
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,800
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang. I have more questions.

205
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Why did you lie about the jade comb?

206
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,960
Auntie told me that she didn't give it to you.

207
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,879
I know everything now.

208
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Mu Dan.

209
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,359
Fu, Chun, don't be afraid.

210
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,039
This matter is a bit difficult to explain
at the moment.

211
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,480
In short, Jiang Chang Yang isn't dead. He's back.

212
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,520
I have a shadow. I'm a living person.

213
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,079
You're not dead! You're alive!

214
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,559
That's wonderful!

215
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,759
Does Chuan Yu know?

216
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,759
If Chuan Yu saw Mr. Jiang, he'd be overjoyed.

217
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,720
He knows. He has been thrilled
throughout the entire journey.

218
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:01,359
But Mr. Jiang, you look unwell.
Have you not fully recovered yet? Let me...

219
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,079
No need. It's just fatigue from travel.

220
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,400
That's right, Jiang Chang Yang,
you've been hiding your injuries from me.

221
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,759
Fu, grab him!

222
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,640
Chun, check his pulse.

223
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,000
Wait... Fu... Fu.

224
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,119
- Come on.
- I'll help too.

225
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,640
Chuan Yu, you...

226
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,599
Hold your master properly!

227
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,319
Chuan Yu, he's not dead.

228
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,359
The Dongqing Festival is approaching.

229
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,640
The military is busy
with drills and various affairs.

230
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,520
I've decided to postpone it for a year.
We'll resume after eliminating critical threats.

231
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,400
When the Dongqing Festival was first established,

232
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,759
it was to honor the Hedong Army's bravery
in defending the borders.

233
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,799
It hasn't been a year
since the Grand General's passing.

234
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,759
We should make it grander in commemoration.

235
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,359
My father never cared about posthumous fame.

236
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,359
He only wished for Hedong's people
to live prosperously.

237
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,879
The people don't know court dangers,
but the Grand General was widely respected.

238
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:10,839
If we suddenly cancel the Dongqing Festival,
it might raise suspicions.

239
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:17,440
Moreover, when sending the Hedong Army back,
Prince Ning planted spies.

240
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,960
They're still hidden in the city.

241
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,359
Any anomaly in Hedong
would make Prince Ning suspicious.

242
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:32,359
You're right. Then, let's proceed
with the Dongqing Festival as usual.

243
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
Please come in, everyone.

244
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,440
How have you been lately?

245
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,319
All is well, thank you.

246
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,119
Fellow townspeople, on this Dongqing day,

247
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,279
let's toast to good fortune for all. Cheers!

248
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,919
Well said!

249
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,000
Here, put this here.

250
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
Min, eat up.

251
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:46,152

252
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:57,305

253
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,400
Yun Niang wrote.
Our old friends in Chang'an are well.

254
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,839
Li Xing has changed,
he now knows measured responses at court

255
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,319
and is no longer confronting
Prince Ning's faction head-on.

256
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,240
Fortunately, he was knocked out that day,
or he'd have been slaughtered.

257
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:15,119
Jiang Chang Yang, don't you think the lanterns
tonight are especially numerous and bright?

258
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,720
On the Dongqing Festival,
people keep all lights burning through the night

259
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,880
to commemorate the Hedong soldiers
who sacrificed their lives in battle.

260
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I wonder how long these peaceful days will last.

261
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,359
If a war is inevitable,
I hope the people won't be affected.

262
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,599
The Hedong Army under your support
has grown strong and well-equipped.

263
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,079
The people and the Hedong Army
work together as one.

264
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,480
With geographical advantages and unity,
we won't let Prince Ning's ambitions succeed.

265
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,759
Tomorrow's worries belong to tomorrow.

266
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,040
Tonight, let's savor this wonderful moment. Come.

267
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:04,234
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

268
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:12,648
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

269
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:20,319
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

270
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,119
Don't be afraid. Come on.

271
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,559
Would you like a sugar figure?

272
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,519
- Sugar figure?
- Do you want one?

273
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,599
We'll take one.

274
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:31,119
Please make figures of both of us.

275
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,576
It's fine.

276
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:53,480
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

277
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,760
This mask is so heavy.

278
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,919
Look! It's done.

279
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Here you go.

280
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,280
Thank you.

281
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,079
Thank you.

282
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,520
Take care.

283
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Here.

284
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,559
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

285
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,359
No one's here. We can take off the mask.

286
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:26,957
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

287
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:35,266
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

288
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:43,528
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

289
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:51,784
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

290
00:31:51,784 --> 00:32:00,212
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

291
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:08,212
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

292
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Close doors and windows.
Guard against fire and theft.

293
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,039
Close doors and windows.
Guard against fire and theft.

294
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,159
I wish we could keep walking like this forever.
But there's a curfew.

295
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,159
With this, the curfew can't stop us.

296
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,480
But you're returning to Jizhou tomorrow.
Won't staying up all night be tiring?

297
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,480
It's a rare occasion. Besides, I can rest
in the carriage during the long journey.

298
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,240
Walking under the moonlit night,
admiring lanterns, what joy!

299
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,440
Jiang Chang Yang went to Hedong anyway.

300
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,200
He also incited the rebellions
in Shuo Fang and Fan Yang.

301
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,440
It seems he and Yu Zheng
are determined to fight me to the death.

302
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,760
The military strength of Hedong is formidable now.
Your Highness must decide soon.

303
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,799
Although Fan Yang and Shuo Fang

304
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,359
are close to Hedong,
their troops aren't as abundant.

305
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,639
It's time to deploy the Xiao family card.

306
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,519
If only Hexi sends troops,
our chances of victory are slim.

307
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,839
Though Jiannan is remote,
its Military Governor pledges loyalty to you.

308
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,879
Why not give him a chance to prove his worth?

309
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,319
Good. Send word that we'll wait no longer.

310
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:39,520
It's time to make the final move.

311
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,280
Yes.

312
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,160
Urgent military report
from six hundred miles away in Hedong.

313
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,760
The Hedong Army has rebelled.
Their crimes are unforgivable.

314
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,008
Your Majesty, please make a swift decision.

315
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:03,272

316
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,880
Your Majesty, I request
to lead troops personally into battle.

317
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,399
I will not return to court
until these bandits are eradicated.

318
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,479
I will accompany Prince Ning to the battlefield.
Please grant us your permission, Your Majesty.

319
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:32,720
Ning leads by example,
setting a standard for all ministers.

320
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:40,639
I shall await your triumphant return
here in Chang'an.

321
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,439
I will not fail your trust, Your Majesty.

322
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,039
These over 4,000 shields are fire-resistant.

323
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,280
They can withstand Prince Ning's
fifty barrels of black fire oil.

324
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,400
General, this bow is made of mulberry wood.

325
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,519
Its bowstring comes
from silkworms fed on mulberry leaves.

326
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,119
Each string uses over 20 silk threads as its core.

327
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,480
Is there anything you cannot acquire?

328
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,159
The Hedong Army is fortunate
to have your assistance.

329
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,400
You flatter me, General.

330
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,760
The rainy spring this year requires caution.
These bows are susceptible to mold.

331
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,519
Please store them near charcoal fires for drying.

332
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,319
I see.

333
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,839
Prince Ning has mobilized his troops.

334
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,079
Be vigilant on the battlefield.

335
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,320
Rest assured. I'll protect myself.

336
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,879
Close combat is chaotic.
Do not overexert yourself despite your skills.

337
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,600
Wait for my return. We'll marry immediately after.

338
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,199
If we do not return victorious,
take Auntie by boat to Xinluo immediately.

339
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,000
Ugh! Don't speak such ill-omened words!

340
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,840
This armor from Mu Dan is quite tough.

341
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,360
Auntie, don't hurt your hands.

342
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,240
Still making jokes.
If you dare to die again, just you wait!

343
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,879
I understand.

344
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,360
You once coveted everything except your own life.

345
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Now that you have me, you should cling to life.

346
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,200
Mu Dan knows me best.

347
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm off.

348
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,960
Military Governor of Hedong Yu Zheng.

349
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,199
Military Governor of Hedong Yu Zheng.

350
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,719
Raising troops in rebellion
is a betrayal of your duty as a subject.

351
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,559
Raising troops in rebellion
is a betrayal of your duty as a subject.

352
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,920
By the imperial court's decree...

353
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,440
By the imperial court's decree...

354
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,639
I lead the Central Army,
Hexi Army, and Jiannan Army

355
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,960
to suppress the rebels.

356
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,360
To suppress the rebels.

357
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Surrender now!

358
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,640
Surrender now!

359
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,039
What hypocrisy!

360
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,000
What hypocrisy!

361
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,559
The Hedong Army
has guarded the frontier for years.

362
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,119
The Hedong Army
has guarded the frontier for years.

363
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,079
We serve the country with loyalty.

364
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,199
We serve the country with loyalty.

365
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,719
We have never harbored rebellious intentions.

366
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,960
We have never harbored rebellious intentions.

367
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
Today, we would rather die for our country.

368
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,760
Today, we would rather die for our country.

369
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,639
Than bow to treacherous officials.

370
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:49,399
Than bow to treacherous officials.

371
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,720
Fine!

372
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,240
Attack!

373
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,839
Release arrows.

374
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:44,519
Defensive formation!

375
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:20,542
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

376
00:42:21,596 --> 00:42:28,956
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

377
00:42:28,956 --> 00:42:37,148
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

378
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:45,500
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

379
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:53,697
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

380
00:42:53,697 --> 00:43:01,884
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

381
00:43:01,884 --> 00:43:10,300
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

382
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:18,300
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

383
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:46,452
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

384
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:53,903
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

385
00:43:53,903 --> 00:44:01,889
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

386
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:10,198
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

387
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:18,460
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

388
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:26,716
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

389
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:35,144
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

390
00:44:35,144 --> 00:44:43,144
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
