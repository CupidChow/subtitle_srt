00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,978

3
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,900

4
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,070

5
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,390

6
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,999
Shopkeeper.

7
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,860

8
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,399
In the past, I was capricious.

9
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,719
Thank you for being so benevolent and loyal,
never abandoning this place.

10
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,939
I am grateful and will surely
not let everyone down again.

11
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:19,160
The contracts for Huamanzhu and Qingshuzhai, as well as the pawnshop receipts are all here untouched.

12
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,279
I have discussed it with Chun and Fu.

13
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:24,539
Mu Dan, you are still our shopkeeper.

14
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,819
After returning from this journey, I am renewed.

15
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,640
I will definitely lead this business
to greater success with everyone.

16
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,419
- Great.
- Yeah!

17
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:44,160
Like everyone here, I have endured hardships
and received kindness from others.

18
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,559
That's why I have the opportunity to stand here.

19
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,900
Now, our days are getting better and better.

20
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,160
I do not wish to be a useless person.

21
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,779
I want to be worthy
of these characters His Majesty granted.

22
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,040
Whether it's an unknown woman,
a craftsman, or a merchant,

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,719
as long as they can help the weak,
stabilize society, and serve the nation,

24
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,020
they will not have wasted their prime years
and should be a national beauty.

25
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,040
Everyone here is like family to me.

26
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,059
I want to tell everyone
that my aspirations have changed.

27
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:17,920
I hope you all can support me and join me.

28
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,480
But how can people as insignificant as we
with little possessions serve the country?

29
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,740
The flowers we grow can be used as medicine,
and the money we earn can help the poor.

30
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,379
Accumulating small acts of kindness
is how we can serve the country.

31
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,099
Mu Dan, you are the shopkeeper, and you need not
consult with us on whatever you do.

32
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,700
But Mu Dan treats us as her own and informs us.

33
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,339
Of course, we're willing to follow the shopkeeper.

34
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,299
In the future, the shop and Fragrance Garden
will operate as usual.

35
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,020
The money used for charitable deeds
will all be deducted from my personal account.

36
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,099
Your monthly pay will not be reduced at all.

37
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,379
Once the new business is established, when I need your help,

38
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,140
I will also distribute payment according to labor.

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,659
I believe Mu Dan will not let everyone down.

40
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,700
But shopkeeper, you have endured
so many hardships along this journey.

41
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,079
Will all your hard-earned money
be used to help others?

42
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,700
I am concerned for you.
It's impractical to suffer for a good reputation.

43
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,739
I am not a sage.
What I do is not solely for others.

44
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,520
Madam, your family once had fertile land,
which was later seized by officials.

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,539
You had no choice but to take your son
to work for wealthy merchants and officials.

46
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,260
When your eldest son accidentally
broke the magistrate's porcelain,

47
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,480
the owner demanded compensation,
but he couldn't pay.

48
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,140
Then the magistrate falsely accused him of theft.

49
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,900
The separation of you and your son to this day
is all due to corrupt officials in power.

50
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:50,319
Everyone, only when society improves,

51
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
can our lives get better and better.

52
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,920
Only then can everyone have the leisure to enjoy
the useless beauty of peonies in Fragrance Garden.

53
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,260
I see it now. I am with you, Shopkeeper.

54
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,779
When the world gets better in the future,
my son will definitely come back.

55
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,580
I am also with you, Shopkeeper.

56
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,439
- I'm with you, too.
- I'm in, too.

57
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:19,299
Thank you, everyone.

58
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,179
Any update on the new shop?

59
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:28,319
We've already chosen a place in the West Market.

60
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,820
Are you sure about this? Chang'an is not
short of medical clinics or pharmacies.

61
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,999
How will your shop compete with them?

62
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,099
Nowadays, it is quite expensive
for common people to use medicine.

63
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,099
People can afford to see a doctor,
but they can't afford to buy medicine.

64
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,539
So, I have studied
ancient prescriptions with Chun.

65
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,079
We have found some medicinal herbs
with the same efficacy, which cost less,

66
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,140
and have drafted new prescriptions.

67
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,360
Meanwhile, we will also provide
free medical consultations every ten days.

68
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,600
As for the medicinal herbs,
they will be sold at cost price.

69
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,679
Families in difficulty can also buy on credit.

70
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,779
The planting and transportation,
storage and sale of medicinal herbs

71
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,940
are different from the flowers you deal with.

72
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,119
The expenses in Sheng County are not small either.
Is your capital sufficient?

73
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you want to invest money to help me?

74
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,720
This benefits the people and serves the country,
so I certainly should contribute my share.

75
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,040
Since it is doing good deeds,
how can I use other people's money?

76
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,299
Rest assured.

77
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:31,360
Now my shop has considerable income,
enough to support it.

78
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,299
Besides, doing business is what I am good at.

79
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,140
You should save your strength for the court.

80
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,260
With Mr. Third, money will surely be needed.

81
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,960
Alright.

82
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,419
In Sheng County, collecting the herbs
from the mountains is not a long-term solution.

83
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,659
Do you have other plans?

84
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,119
Upon leaving Sheng County,
I took a few clever villagers with me.

85
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,239
I taught them how to grow medicinal materials.

86
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:09,040
Besides that, sesame and rapeseed,

87
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,239
which can be used as both medicine and food
should also be grown.

88
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,720
The people of Chang'an love eating Hu cakes.

89
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,419
Sprinkling sesame on top adds flavor,
and we certainly won't lack buyers.

90
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,460
You want the Hu cake yourself, don't you?
Pretending to act for the public good.

91
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,659
As if you don't like it yourself.

92
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,480
Coming from someone who always put
several pieces of cake in the mutton soup.

93
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,339
As for the young and strong men,

94
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,280
besides farming and cultivating medicinal herbs,
they can also escort goods.

95
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,060
I also found several properties
that were lying idle

96
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,940
and converted them into workshops for women.

97
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,410
Chun, Ms. Sun, A Man, and I will
personally teach everyone the skills.

98
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,580
See, you have to scrape it
to look something like this.

99
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:59,759
Turn it like this, right.
Put a little force, put a little force.

100
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,040
You're pulling it too tight here.
It can be a bit looser on this side.

101
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,579
In Sheng County, do you plan to open a clinic?

102
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,559
Of course, I will.

103
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,459
It is inherently difficult
for poor people to see a doctor.

104
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,819
If there are no doctors in this county,

105
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:17,779
one would have to come to Chang'an for treatment.

106
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,120
Even if the body can endure the long journey,

107
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,220
food and accommodation
would then be a significant expense.

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,340
However, those with excellent medical skills
mostly do not wish to go to remote places.

109
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,020
Who can sit in the medical hall of Sheng County?

110
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,560
I plan to find two apprentice doctors, like Chun,
who have a passion for medicine, to be there.

111
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,359
This way, they can train themselves,
improve their medical skills,

112
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,620
and alleviate the difficulties
of the common people.

113
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,980
Of course, these measures can only
be used for common minor illnesses.

114
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,920
When it comes to complicated diseases,

115
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,059
I have already instructed my caravan
to prepare fast horses,

116
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,559
so Chun can go and treat everyone.

117
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,040
You have thought this through.

118
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,559
The medical hall in Sheng County provides
free consultations, only charging for medicine.

119
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,140
If a patient has no money,

120
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,659
their family or they themselves after recovery
can offer labor in exchange.

121
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:15,779
How do you determine if someone is truly poor
or just wants to take advantage?

122
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,299
I have asked Magistrate Yu to draft
a list of impoverished households in this county.

123
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:23,000
Whether it is true or false,
one glance will reveal it.

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,400
Since consultations are free, didn't you
think about waiving the medicine fees too?

125
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:34,620
A peck of rice brings gratitude,
but a dou of rice brings hatred.

126
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,000
A foolishly benevolent person
will only foster others' greed.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
Furthermore, the enterprise of aiding the nation
needs to be sustainable.

128
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,800
If losses are incurred everywhere,
it is hard to sustain.

129
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,779
Moreover, if I do not take a single cent,
it would disrupt the industry's norms.

130
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,959
In the end, it would only
bring unnecessary trouble.

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,860
You are so clear-headed and astute.
I have indeed overthought.

132
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,959
It's a pity Mr. Third is not here. If he were,
he would certainly be very pleased.

133
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,439
He might eat two more big bowls of rice.

134
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,699
Rest assured.

135
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,979
I will do my utmost within my capabilities.

136
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,679
As for the court,
it depends on you and His Majesty.

137
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,359
I hope you can eradicate treacherous ministers
and eliminate harsh policies soon.

138
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:31,438
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

139
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:39,952
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

140
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:47,960
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

141
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,579
Please come inside, sir.

142
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:50,860
The prescription has already been prepared.

143
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,340
As long as the medicine is taken on time,
the child will surely get better.

144
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,160
- Thank you, Doctor.
 - Please, quickly rise.

145
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,120
Shopkeeper, the Village Chief
of Sheng County is waiting outside.

146
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,840
Okay, take a look first.

147
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,719
Thank you, Doctor.

148
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,260
Be careful. Next.

149
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,860
Walk slowly.

150
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Mu Dan.

151
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,179
- Zhao Zhao.
- Shopkeeper.

152
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:18,500
Village Chief.

153
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,059
Come on.

154
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,520
Zhao Zhao.

155
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,779
Mu Dan.

156
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,240
The sachets Mother made sold for a lot of money.

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,280
Mother said that we are going to the city today
and I could buy two packs of Malt Candy.

158
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,100
Of course you can,
I will give you a few more packs

159
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,079
so you can bring them back to the village
and share with your little friends?

160
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:36,860
Thank you, Mu Dan.

161
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,660
Thank you for your trouble.

162
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,220
Mu Dan, what is your shop called?

163
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,520
Look, Zhao Zhao, my shop is called Wuyong Hall.

164
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,980
What does Wuyong Hall mean?

165
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,920
It means to understand all things
and transform the world.

166
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,359
To comprehend the way of the mean.

167
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,040
What is the mean and why should one understand it?

168
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,719
During the private school's lessons, Zhao Zhao,
you must listen carefully.

169
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:11,699
When the rape flowers in the village bloom,
your teacher will speak about this topic.

170
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:17,599
By then, you will understand the meaning
of the characters Wuyong.

171
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,939

172
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,870

173
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:44,000

174
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,860
Father.

175
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,740
I shall not disturb the General
and his daughter's conversation. Excuse me.

176
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,020
If I did not come personally,

177
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,539
you would still be enjoying yourself
and not thinking of returning to Hexi.

178
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,860
Not at all.

179
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,560
I miss you both a lot

180
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,920
and I really want to go home. But that marriage proposal…

181
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,459
I have already spoken to Prince Ning
and the marriage is canceled.

182
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:38,040
In the future, Xue Xi,
you can marry whoever you want to.

183
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,160
But Prince Ning will not let me go easily.

184
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,539
Father, did you promise him something?

185
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,980
You don't need to worry about court affairs.

186
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,760
I will protect you and take care of this family.

187
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,319
I won. Bring the Secluded Orchid in Jieshi Mode.

188
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,739
I thought you would give something else,
but how come it's peonies again?

189
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:15,020
Don't be a sore loser and tease me.

190
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,779
She's leaving and you won't even
give her a music score. So stingy.

191
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Xue Xi, my farewell gift is a flower,
yet not a flower.

192
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
What does that mean?

193
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,020
The day I first saw you, it was as if a fairy
descended from heaven to save me from danger.

194
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,079
I will never forget that.

195
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:00,779
Your gift is truly thoughtful. I really like it.

196
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,620
I'm glad you like it.

197
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,100
In that case, I didn't really lose.

198
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,500
When you find your true love, on your wedding day,

199
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,520
the Secluded Orchid in Jieshi Mode
will be yours as a wedding gift.

200
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,299
I'm lucky to have you in my life.

201
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,459
Thank you for the companionship
and rescue these days.

202
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:26,740
We'll see each other around.

203
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,779
See you around.

204
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,799
Confucius said:

205
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,880
A gentleman seeks not to be full in food
nor at ease in dwelling.

206
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,959
Be diligent in actions and cautious in speech,
then you have the Dao to correct your errors.

207
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,660
This can be said to be truly fond of learning.

208
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,630
Lady He.

209
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
- Open your mouth and let me see.
- Lady He.

210
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,020
Go back to work.

211
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:17,279
Alright.

212
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,740
How do you feel after taking a lap?

213
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,599
The population is thriving and flourishing.

214
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,640
It hardly seems like the Sheng County
I visited last time.

215
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,499
Haven't you always wanted
to lend your strength to Wuyong Hall?

216
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:39,620
Currently, there is a difficult task at hand.

217
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,000
After much thought,
it seems you are the most suitable.

218
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,420
- What is it?
 - Testing medicine, do you dare?

219
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,300
I trust the medicine you
and Chun made. Bring it over.

220
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,359
That's really wonderful.

221
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,240
Get up.

222
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,580
Alright, take off your clothes.

223
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,820
What do you mean?

224
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,780
Testing medicine for wounds naturally
requires applying it to the wounds.

225
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,680
You have so many old wounds, so naturally,
you can test which medicine works better.

226
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,820
Give me the medicine, and I'll take it back.
I'll tell you the results in a few days.

227
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,900
The rule of Wuyong Hall is that either I or Chun
must be present when testing medicine.

228
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,520
In case of any accident,
it can be dealt with promptly.

229
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,000
When you were injured and unconscious,
what have I not seen?

230
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,860
What, is Mr. Jiang feeling shy?

231
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,760
As the Floral Envoy, I've seen so much.
How could I be shy of this?

232
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,659
That's great. Those who practice medicine
do not distinguish between genders.

233
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,520
I entrust you to help with this favor.

234
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,619
Alright.

235
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:17,300
This medicine can smooth scars,
and even old ones can be significantly reduced.

236
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,800
Alright.

237
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,990
Jiang Chang Yang,

238
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,540
I can take good care of myself.

239
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,800
You need not take risks for me in the future.

240
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,639
Why are you blushing?

241
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,520
The medicine applied to my chest is slightly warm.

242
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,720
This medicine contains turmeric. It's harmless.

243
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:26,019
When you gave me a jade comb back then,
it was because you were afraid I'd be tired.

244
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:31,900
You wanted me to comb my hair and relax.
But aren't you also tired?

245
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,680
The Floral Envoy must wear a mask
all the time outside.

246
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:40,699
Once at home, you can take it off.

247
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,679
Jiang Chang Yang, around me, you need no disguise.

248
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,540
I am not in disguise.

249
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,040
Being with you, I am always at ease.

250
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:13,839
The night you were injured and unconscious,
you dreamt of a woman, do you remember?

251
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,760
Did I? Did I say any nonsense?

252
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:31,240
You didn't say much. You just held her tightly
and didn't let her leave.

253
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:43,159
I almost forgot that I still have matters
to discuss with Mr. Third later.

254
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:47,404
I'm going back to Chang'an first.

255
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:51,334
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

256
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:55,060
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

257
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,259
Today I'm happy, so I'll drink a little more.

258
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:01,016
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

259
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,668
It's empty.

260
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,319
There is more here.

261
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,300
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

262
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,459
The first to marry is a dog.

263
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,920
Mu Dan,

264
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,940
upon parting, I also have a gift for you.

265
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,550
On the Lantern Festival,

266
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,800
Sui Zhi intended to confess his feelings under the full moon.

267
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,939
But unexpectedly, that person
was hurt because of him.

268
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:48,359
It made him full of remorse, unable to speak.

269
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,179
I want to restore the palace at Mount Li,
but the Ministry of Revenue claims poverty.

270
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,440
It turns out the money has all gone
into Zheng Shou De's mansion.

271
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,400
They've uncovered 500,000 strings of coins,

272
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,930
and who knows how much is yet to be found.

273
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:34,259
This treasury shouldn't bear the surname Li,
and it should be named Zheng.

274
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,979
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

275
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:47,580
Your Majesty, I'm well aware of all tax matters
for I've worked long in the Ministry of Revenue.

276
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,720
After a layered extortion from the local governor
to the clerics and ministers at Chang'an,

277
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,140
only three of ten of the taxed money
enters the treasury.

278
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,140
Although I have obtained the real ledger,

279
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,200
I searched everywhere in Zheng's residence,
yet the 500,000 strings are still missing.

280
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:10,300
Your Majesty, the Ministry of Revenue's corruption
is a deep-rooted sickness.

281
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,860
I hope you will investigate all the officials
in the Ministry of Revenue.

282
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,540
Zheng Shou De hasn't been minister for long,
yet he dares to keep false ledgers.

283
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,659
It is hard to say he has no support behind him.

284
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,699
I heard that he was recommended by Prince Ning,
and their private relations were deep.

285
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:29,076
You said it yourself that Zheng Shou De
hasn't been back to Chang'an for long,

286
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:32,300
so his occasional encounters
with Prince Ning are normal.

287
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,060
How can the Censor accuse Prince Ning
without evidence?

288
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:52,659
Your Majesty, I have widely gathered talents
without regard to familial relations.

289
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,860
I acted solely for the well-being
of the country and its people.

290
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,659
Who would have thought Zheng Shou De
would betray me and deceive Your Majesty.

291
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:07,580
I am heartbroken and cannot shirk
the responsibility of negligence.

292
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,079
I ask Your Majesty to administer punishment.

293
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:17,340
Ning, I have never doubted your loyalty.

294
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,900
Your Majesty, you cherish the brotherly bond.

295
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,720
But as the ruler of all,

296
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,600
your mercy and leniency harm the entire state.

297
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,620
Your Majesty.

298
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,320
Your Majesty.

299
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,179
Minister Lu's actions are somewhat reckless.

300
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,739
Factionalism and favoritism must be investigated,

301
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,219
but now, the most critical thing
is to find those 500,000 strings.

302
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:49,580
After all, the natural disasters nationwide
have already become an urgent crisis.

303
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,599
The country comes first.

304
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,040
If Your Majesty trusts me,

305
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,459
within three days, I will uncover
the embezzled money and solve this case.

306
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,716
If not, for the 500,000 strings,

307
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:06,720
I will sell things in my house to pay it back.

308
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,120

309
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,820
Your Highness, it's my fault
that I arrived late due to my hangover.

310
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,240
Otherwise, I would have
scolded them on your behalf.

311
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,699
I have heard about what happened.
500,000 strings of coins is not a small amount.

312
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:41,659
Returning them to the national treasury
would indeed be a pity.

313
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:47,399
In my opinion, it's better to sacrifice a few
minor officials and let them gather the money.

314
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,499
At the birthday banquet
where Zheng Shou De lost the ledger,

315
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:59,699
I heard that you were also very drunk
and left the banquet early.

316
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:04,960
You know that I have always been
fond of drinking and lack restraint.

317
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,419
Lu Chu used to be cautious and timid.

318
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,019
How did Zheng Shou De's arrival
suddenly change his demeanor?

319
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,820
He took up the position of Transport Officer
and still wasn't satisfied.

320
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,900
Now he even dares to challenge His Highness.
Who gave him the courage?

321
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,739
Sui Zhi only loves to play with cats and dogs.
If he starts to change…

322
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:31,299
I worried for His Highness and rushed here to offer my advice with good intentions.

323
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:35,300
Zi Shu, you're now without a position
and cannot serve Prince Ning in any matters,

324
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,219
so you want to begin sowing discord?

325
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:42,659
Or are you still pining for my Mu Dan?

326
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,640
Sui Zhi,

327
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,730
for other things, it's no problem.

328
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:52,880
But I remember
your tolerance for alcohol is quite high.

329
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,599
That night, you got drunk so quickly, didn't you?

330
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:08,040
You rat.

331
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,120

332
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,600
Mu Dan.

333
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:40,140
Recently, Chun and I have developed a new formula.

334
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,240
It can enhance yang energy,
dispel wind evil, and also aid sleep.

335
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,660
It's selling very well this month.
Do you want to try it?

336
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,200
Is that so?

337
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,760
Are you complaining that I indulge in drinking
day and night, which weakens my strength?

338
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,900
Do you want to boost my yang energy?

339
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,800
Exactly, if your body is healthy,

340
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,680
I also benefit from it. Follow me, Mr. Jiang.

341
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:20,079
Jiang Chang Yang, what's the matter
with this red mark on your collar?

342
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,340
It's just some rouge accidentally rubbed on.
Why make a fuss?

343
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,159
Let me see. Don't try to deceive me.

344
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,912
You clearly said you were drinking
with Tang Si Lang last night.

345
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:31,259
Where did the rouge come from, huh?

346
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,100
The beautiful lady he brought got drunk
and accidentally bumped into me.

347
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,919
Why are you avoiding? When you married me,
you promised me the world.

348
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,979
But now you use the money I earned for you
to have fun with other beautiful ladies,

349
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:44,380
leaving me alone to guard the empty boudoir,
Jiang Chang Yang.

350
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,780
Why are you so angry? I'm sorry, okay?

351
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,659
Today, I'll only accompany you.

352
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,340
Sweetheart, don't be angry.

353
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,140
Not this one.

354
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,900
Mr. Jiang, the spy is gone.

355
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:12,079
Climbing so high, that's impressive indeed.

356
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,900
As expected of the Floral Envoy, you picked
the most expensive one to smash casually.

357
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,879
Your business is thriving,
yet you still fear a couple of broken vases.

358
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,719
How does our contract
divide the profits? Let me see it.

359
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:46,300
Spies are coming to my place. What happened?

360
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:49,900
We have exposed the corruption
in the Ministry of Revenue.

361
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,880
After several disturbances, Prince Ning
is becoming increasingly suspicious of me.

362
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,872
The contract was made in duplicate.
I had already burned my copy before I came.

363
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:08,399
You are afraid that Prince Ning will take action
against you, and it will involve me.

364
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,100
I didn't spend the slightest effort
on your shop or your garden.

365
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,419
I've collected interest for so long
that I've already recouped my principal.

366
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:23,019
Now you still have the Wuyong Hall to manage.
There are many places that need money.

367
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,480
Without me as a debt collector,
won't you be able to expand your ambitions more?

368
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:34,100
That's fine. My business won't stop anyway.

369
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:40,319
If you really run into any mishap later,
I'll still have money to arrange things for you.

370
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:47,860
For the shop where you invested the principal,
I'm saving all the interest for you.

371
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,879
Our relationship is not maintained
by just a piece of paper.

372
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,310
- I know you are loyal, but really,...
- I'm doing this not only for you.

373
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,039
I hope Mr. Third can win.

374
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,420
Okay.

375
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,179
Jiang Chang Yang, be careful of everything.

376
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,659
Listening to what you said just now,
I feel very reassured.

377
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,879
If something unexpected really happens,
at least, you will take care of me for life.

378
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:50,900
At worst, my beloved concubine will handle
my burial. Thank you.

379
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:17,019
The list from the Assistant Minister
has somewhat confused me.

380
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:21,680
Your Majesty, these are all officials
who have bribed Zheng Shou De.

381
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,699
If they are said to be accomplices,
there is evidence to verify it.

382
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:32,819
Disposing of these minor officials won't hinder
your control over the court.

383
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,700
Minister, you rarely interact with me.

384
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,240
How should I repay your advice today?

385
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,739
Unfortunately, Zheng Shou De has fallen.

386
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:56,839
Your majesty surely cannot allow
that ungrateful Lu Chu to take the position.

387
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Your Highness, I have long admired you.

388
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:06,580
Now is the time for me to earn merits
and demonstrate my loyalty to you and the court.

389
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,359
Your Highness, I beg for your grace.

390
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:25,259
Zhang Qiu, you're so eager for merit
that you've been somewhat inconsiderate.

391
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:29,499
For the sake of some money,
you want to cost His Highness many loyal subjects.

392
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,960
Doesn't this make outsiders chill to see?

393
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,479
I really don't know
how to come up with 500,000 strings of coins.

394
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:48,020
Mr. Liu, you have a meticulous mind.
Do you have any brilliant ideas?

395
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,472
I do have one.

396
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:58,859
I just don't know if you dare to do it.

397
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,820
For His Highness,
I am willing to go through fire and water.

398
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,630
Have you really made up your mind, Mr. Jiang?

399
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,039
Zhang Qiu Feng has already left
Prince Ning's Mansion.

400
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,740
We have no other choice.
It's up to you and Yun Niang.

401
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,240
Yes.

402
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,459
Tomorrow, the busier the Mu Dan shop, the better.
Make sure she doesn't get involved.

403
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,010
Yes.

404
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,099
Madam, please come inside.

405
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,220
Take care.

406
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,499
Give me the medicine
and hand the prescription to the old lady.

407
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:41,900
- Madam.
- Why are all the follow-up patients coming today?

408
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,740
Madam, you are fine.

409
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,999
After finishing these few doses of medicine,
you'll get better. Here you go.

410
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,760
- Take care.
- Thank you, Lady He.

411
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,680
Madam, are you alright?

412
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,819
Next, please.

413
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:58,199
Lian Zhou?

414
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:08,660
Pei Zhong appears gentle and refined, but in fact,
he is of a violent disposition.

415
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,740
Inside the boudoir,

416
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,200
he likes to use a whip.

417
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:19,780
Your body is layered
with old wounds over new ones.

418
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,399
If the wounds fester and become infected,
it might endanger your life.

419
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:27,260
Can you stay away for a while
to recuperate for a month?

420
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,550
I'm just a gift.

421
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:37,220
How can I say no?

422
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:48,200
Mu Dan, I made the wrong choice.

423
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:54,579
I should have listened to you
and left Chang'an back then.

424
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:04,800
Lian Zhou, as long as you are willing,
it's not too late.

425
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,459
I can help you escape from the Pei residence.

426
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:11,359
Mu Dan.

427
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,059
Amaranth mixed with daffodil juice

428
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,820
can cause a red rash and skin ulceration.

429
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,499
Then I'll have Chun treat you,
saying you have smallpox.

430
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:27,019
Given Pei Zhong's nature,
he won't care about your life or death.

431
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:31,380
But to prevent the disease from spreading,
he will definitely expel you from the house.

432
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,180
Then you will be free.

433
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:38,340
I will never forget your grace of rebirth.

434
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,579
Lian Zhou, get up quickly.

435
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:43,900
Slow down, be careful.

436
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,900
Starting over is certainly difficult,
but remember.

437
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,059
No matter what happens, you must cherish yourself.

438
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:02,160
No one is worth your subservience.

439
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,099
In childhood, I had my parents' protection.

440
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,419
When they were gone,

441
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:16,660
I then sought protection
from one man after another.

442
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,550
I seem to have forgotten

443
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,050
the taste of freedom.

444
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:28,520
I… can I really do it?

445
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:35,680
Of course you can. You are wise, agile,
and experienced in dealing with the world.

446
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,280
You are skilled in embroidery
and have quite a study of women's dresses.

447
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,220
In the future, you can open
your own dressmaking shop.

448
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,399
Business will surely flourish.

449
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,539
Do you know that Wuyong Hall
has opened in Sheng County?

450
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,660
The farm women there are illiterate
but can support themselves with their skills,

451
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,500
let alone you. Even without a man, you can still live well.

452
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,340
Chun is right.

453
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,700
Lian Zhou, I will have someone prepare
the poisonous flower juice immediately.

454
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,439
It will be delivered
to the Pei residence in three days.

455
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,139
Alright.

456
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:24,579
Mu Dan, if you have the chance,
leave Jiang Chang Yang as soon as possible.

457
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:29,139
Prince Ning plans to deal with him.
Don't get involved.

458
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,890
What does Prince Ning
plan to do to Jiang Chang Yang?

459
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,720
Pei Zhong says Prince Ning intends to pin
the corruption charges on Jiang Chang Yang

460
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,740
and use his property to offset
the Ministry of Revenue's deficit.

461
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,620
I'm afraid they might even take his life

462
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,160
to quell the people's anger.

463
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:02,780
Mr. Zhang Qiu.

464
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,919
This is business.

465
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,520
- A calamity to the nation and its people.
 - Such a large gold ingot!

466
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,860
- Arrest him.
- A corrupt official. So greedy.

467
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,679
This is all the people's money.

468
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,800
- Keep searching.
 - Yes.

469
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,950

470
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,740
Search.

471
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,860
Move aside.

472
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,900
- Make way, make way.
- Sir, sir, you can't enter here.

473
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,359
- Move aside, move aside.
- Search it!

474
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:43,760
Sir, sir.

475
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,460
Move aside.

476
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,839
- He embezzled it all.
 - Big corrupt official.

477
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,660
- So much.
- He's too greedy.

478
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,079
How much do you think this is?

479
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,920
This is really too much.

480
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,160
Excuse me. Let me through. Excuse me.

481
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,400
- Stop.
- Stop.

482
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,259
This corrupt official is wicked.

483
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,919
Big corrupt official.

484
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,380
He's out. He's out. The darned official is out.

485
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,220
Serves him right.

486
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,860
Darned Jiang, such a wicked official.
How much of the people's money have you plundered?

487
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,199
- Hit him, hit him.
- Hit him.

488
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:37,479
Hit him.

489
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:40,700
What are you doing here?
I didn't want you to see this scene.

490
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,180
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm telling you.

491
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,380
Since I signed the first contract with you,

492
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,499
I have been in the same pit with you.

493
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:50,260
No matter what happens, I will face it with you.

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining

496
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:16,904
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

497
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:25,318
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

498
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:33,410
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

499
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:41,662
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

500
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:49,959
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

501
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:58,246
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

502
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:06,562
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

503
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:14,762
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

504
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:42,714
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

505
00:43:42,714 --> 00:43:50,165
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

506
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:58,251
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

507
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:06,460
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

508
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:14,722
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

509
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:22,978
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

510
00:44:22,978 --> 00:44:31,406
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

511
00:44:31,406 --> 00:44:39,406
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
