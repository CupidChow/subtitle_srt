00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,000
In the Name of Blossom

3
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,000

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
Darned Jiang, such a wicked official.
How much of the people's money have you plundered?

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,840
- Hit him, hit him.
- Hit him.

6
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,300
- Darned corrupt official. Hit him!
- Hit this corrupt official!

7
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,419
What are you doing here?
I didn't want you to see this scene.

8
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,820
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm telling you.

9
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,139
Since I signed the first contract with you,

10
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,259
I have been in the same pit with you.

11
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,100
No matter what happens, I will face it with you.

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,580
That's him. Corrupt official.

13
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,879
- Darned corrupt official!
- Beat him to death!

14
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,399
- Serves you right!
- Serves him right.

15
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,120
Separate them.

16
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
Get lost.

17
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,840
Don't touch her.

18
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,659
You cannot let him go.

19
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,840
Zhang Qiu Feng, in my youth,
I accompanied His Majesty day and night.

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,980
As a small official from a humble family,
do you dare to move against me?

21
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,300
You have sinned too much,
and His Majesty can no longer tolerate it.

22
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:04,600
The decree has been issued.
Now, admit your guilt and receive the decree.

23
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,772
I humbly listen to the decree.

24
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,439
Jiang Chang Yang, Vice Minister of the Office
of Imperial Ceremonies and the Floral Envoy,

25
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,339
formed factions and neglected duties,
occupying positions without making contributions.

26
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,700
There's irrefutable evidence
that he embezzled public funds.

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,180
Considering your years of service and hardship,

28
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,659
I do not wish to be overly harsh.

29
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,219
You'll be relieved of duty from this day.

30
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,740
Jiang Chang Yang's corrupt gains
obtained by taking bribes and bending the law,

31
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,119
and his private assets involved in illegal trading
are to be confiscated to the national treasury.

32
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,620
Release him.

33
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,240
Jiang Chang Yang, accept the decree.

34
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,119
I am wronged.

35
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,420
These silks and the rare treasures in your mansion

36
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,190
add up to more than 500,000 strings.

37
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,779
How dare you cry injustice?

38
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,819
Half of these are my profits,
and half are bribes from various officials to me.

39
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,580
I can admit to the crime of accepting bribes.

40
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,140
But I cannot admit to the severe crime
of embezzling the Ministry of Revenue's revenue.

41
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,519
I have kept records of all the bribes
from various officials over the years.

42
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,599

43
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,740
Not a single corrupt official can be let go.

44
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,120
Not a single corrupt official can be let go.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,219
Not a single corrupt official can be let go.

46
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,519
Not a single corrupt official can be let go.

47
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:32,140
Not a single corrupt official can be let go.

48
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,119
Quiet. Quiet now.

49
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:38,939
What a troublemaker you are.

50
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,080
Calamity is imminent, yet you continue
to recklessly drag others into it.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,900
You will know everything once you investigate.

52
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,099
Submit to His Majesty and punish corruption.

53
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:53,339
Submit to His Majesty and punish corruption.

54
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,020
You commoners, you need not say much.

55
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,120
This matter will be judged by the imperial court.

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
- Let's go.
- This treacherous official must be severely punished.

57
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,239
Let's go.

58
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,079
That's all the money I've saved
through hard work over the years.

59
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,600
Jiang Chang Yang, Jiang Chang Yang.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Hit him.

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,199
Stop! Stop!

62
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,680
- Wait a minute.
- Stop it.

63
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,339
Wait, don't accidentally hurt the good people.

64
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,040
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,179
Lady He, you are kind-hearted and do good deeds.

66
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,779
Why must you associate
with such a treacherous official?

67
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,840
She is the concubine of the Jiang Mansion,
in cahoots with him.

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,539
She is not any good either, hit them.

69
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:38,539
You can't say that.

70
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,559
The illness of my father was cured
by the Wuyong Hall of Lady He.

71
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,399
Lady He, you should leave Jiang Chang Yang,
or else you will be implicated by him.

72
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,099
Yes.

73
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,999
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,839
No matter what outsiders say, in my eyes,

75
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,439
you, Jiang Sui Zhi,
are the most compatible person with me.

76
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,380
Let's go. We're going home.

77
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,239
Hit them.

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Be careful of retribution.

79
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,060

80
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,112
Those who bribed are all from noble families.

81
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,620
Their actions impact the whole situation.

82
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,679
You must know that erring with a gentleman
is better than upsetting a villain.

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,140
Jiang Chang Yang cares most about his face.

84
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,539
I told you to cut off his retreat,
not to step on his face.

85
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,539
Now you've been bitten by the losing dog,
even involving Prince Ning's people.

86
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,900
I truly did not expect
Jiang Chang Yang to be so shameless.

87
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,160
Even after losing his position, he still tries
to offend the noble families and Your Highness.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,020
But this case has become
known throughout the city.

89
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,820
Handling it all at once
will earn the praise of the people.

90
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,020
It is beneficial to your reputation
as well, Your Highness.

91
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,639
Zhang Qiu, you have also established
your reputation with this merit,

92
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,979
suppressing the arrogance of Lu Chu.

93
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:27,140
You've been promoted to Minister of Revenue
without any dispute in court.

94
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,979
The Ministry of Revenue
is still in the palm of your hand, Your Highness.

95
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,960
As for the vacancy, we can slowly find
a loyal and capable person to fill it.

96
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,099
Zheng Shou De is useless.

97
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:48,319
Whether you can secure the position
of Minister depends on your abilities.

98
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,900
Thank you for your trust.

99
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,260
Although the contract is dissolved,

100
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,484
our relationship may still affect your business.

101
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,940
How aboutâ€¦

102
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,079
If I leave you now,

103
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,339
in the eyes of outsiders,
wouldn't I become a sycophant?

104
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,039
Endure it.

105
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,419
So many people rely on you for their livelihood.
You should prioritize the bigger picture.

106
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:28,260
The bigger picture means losing some noble guests
who came to buy flowers from me because of you.

107
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,739
But my business is still thriving.

108
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:37,539
Huamanzhu and Qingshuzhai sell mostly
affordable goods for the common people.

109
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,580
Wuyong Hall wins by relying on female doctors
and affordable prescriptions.

110
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,339
You won't affect any of those businesses.

111
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,580
That's good to know.

112
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,380
What's so good about that?

113
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,900
Other good officials erect monuments
and leave their names immortalized.

114
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,700
But what about you?

115
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,819
Not only is no one aware of your deeds,
but you're also being criticized by the citizens.

116
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,179
About what I did, Mr. Third knows,

117
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,800
my teacher knows, and you know, that's enough.

118
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,960
You always conceal half in front of me.
I don't dare say I truly know you.

119
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,900
Sometimes when I'm afraid they'll worry,

120
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,439
I hide things as well, not just from you.

121
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:31,459
Am I the same as them?
Don't hide things from me in the future.

122
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,719
Zhang Qiu Feng is one of us.

123
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,459
Since you cannot dispel Prince Ning's doubts,

124
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,220
you sacrificed yourself to secure
Zhang Qiu Feng's position.

125
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,256
It's not just for him.

126
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,419
Within the six ministries
and the two capitals' thirteen circuits,

127
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,020
over thirty corrupt officials
will be implicated by me.

128
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,360
They will soon be investigated and imprisoned,

129
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,900
including the prefect
who has been exploiting Sheng County.

130
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,040
The vacated positions will gradually
be filled with upright and virtuous officials.

131
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,439
The great endeavor is important,
but so is your safety.

132
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,819
Have you considered that if Prince Ning
really goes to extremes and uses

133
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,100
public discontent to force your execution,
what would you do?

134
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,419
He wouldn't.

135
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,659
If he deals with me too harshly,
his people will also suffer.

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,819
Besides, I have helped him a lot before.

137
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,400
His suspicions of me have no concrete evidence.

138
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:01,939
His actions against me now
are merely a test and intimidation.

139
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,279
Without money, it will be inconvenient
to work for Mr. Third in the future.

140
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,740
If there are any further movements,
inform me in advance.

141
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,699
I have a caravan that can enter
and exit Chang'an inconspicuously.

142
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,679
Your Wuyong Hall is already serving the country.

143
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,640
It's better not to meddle in court politics.

144
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,980
Jiang Chang Yang, do you have to be so distant?

145
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:02,240
It's midnight.

146
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,319
If Lian Zhou drank the flower juice, it should have taken effect an hour ago.

147
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,479
Why hasn't she come yet?

148
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,579
Don't worry. Let's wait a bit longer.

149
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,900
It's midnight.

150
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,500
They're here.

151
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's go.

152
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,880
What happened?

153
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,179
She had originally packed her things.

154
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:55,579
She happily told me that she could
leave the Pei residence after tonight.

155
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,699
But before she could pour
the flower juice into the water,

156
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,740
Pei Zhong dragged her away.

157
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,839
Lian Zhou was given to Pei Zhong
by Prince Ning, after all.

158
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,659
Now that she has died,
is this how Pei Zhong treats her?

159
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,039
She also pleaded with Prince Ning
when she started to get beaten,

160
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,689
but there are too many women
who died in the house.

161
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,900
They are all the same,

162
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,800
thrown into the mass grave in a roll of straw mat.

163
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,730
Why?

164
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Why am I always one step late?

165
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,250
Why?

166
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,479
Why can I never save you?

167
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,920
The miserable appearance of being a woman,

168
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,640
lowly and hard to express with words.

169
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:37,212
 â™« The miserable appearance of being a woman â™«

170
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:42,560
 â™« Lowly and hard to express with words â™«

171
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,500
 â™« Men are the family pillar â™«

172
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,280
Lian Zhou looks even better now
than the first time we met.

173
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,230
Madam,

174
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,270
you are finally liberated.

175
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:04,670
Finally, you can reunite with your family.

176
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,240
â™« â™«

177
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,056
 â™« Not cherished by the family â™«

178
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:22,492
 â™« Even people from different places could meet â™«

179
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:24,640
 â™« But we are more separated than the stars â™«

180
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,860

181
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,839
 Lian Zhou, in your next life,

182
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,688
 may you protect yourself well,
and be carefree and unrestrained.

183
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:42,220

184
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,120
Sir, take care.

185
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,040
Why are you here instead of staying
in the residence to avoid trouble?

186
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,280
Liu Lang said you were in low spirits.

187
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,040
I see Wuyong Hall's business is as usual.
Did something happen to other shops?

188
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,299
Lian Zhou died.

189
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,400
She went to Pei's residence, no wonder.

190
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,340
We agreed a few days ago

191
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:35,280
that once she escaped Pei's residence,
she'd live freely.

192
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:43,640
Whether it is Sheng Yi,
the mute girl, or Lian Zhou,

193
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,740
I couldn't save any of them.

194
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,679
Hasn't Wuyong Hall saved enough people?

195
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,480
You are not an immortal, so why blame yourself?

196
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,819
Indeed, the world is unpredictable,
and human life is fragile.

197
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,070
So we must cherish the people in front of us,

198
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,380
no?

199
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,939
Chang Yang was dismissed from office,
and you righteously took care of him.

200
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:09,019
When alone, does he cherish you even more?

201
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,799
Liu Lang, you are hiding something from me.

202
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:17,439
No, I'm not.

203
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,739
You have been advising me
to move out of the Jiang Mansion.

204
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:28,399
But now you not only call him Chang Yang,
but also asked him to come and check on me.

205
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,520
To be honest, did you do something behind my back?

206
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:40,520
Mu Dan, do you remember the white jade hairpin?

207
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:49,780
Liu Lang, you shouldn't have done that.

208
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:56,920
In this world, apart from my sister and my mother,
only you treat me sincerely well.

209
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:01,979
I don't want to see you sad and crying
because of Jiang Chang Yang.

210
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:06,179
Nor do I want a day to come when you abandon me.

211
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,419
I said I would take care of you for Sheng Yi,

212
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,739
and I will be your sister for a lifetime.

213
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,100
How could I abandon you?

214
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,259
In the meantime,
it is precisely because I am your sister,

215
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,259
that when you make a mistake,
I have the responsibility to guide you.

216
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:28,820
Liu Lang, interaction with others
requires sincerity and trust.

217
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,680
People and things obtained through vile means
will eventually be lost one day.

218
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,580
Do you understand that?

219
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,440
I do.

220
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,219
Since you were fearful, why did you
inform Jiang Chang Yang of this matter?

221
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,019
That day, when you were kidnapped,
he took me and rushed all the way.

222
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,599
He was bleeding nonstop on the way,
but he didn't say anything.

223
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:01,659
He even asked me to clean the blood on the saddle,
fearing that you would feel guilty upon seeing it.

224
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,559
So I saw it clearly that he truly cares about you.

225
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:10,140
That's why I told him the truth
so he could tell you personally.

226
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,060
But he's been so hesitant, and it drove me crazy.

227
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,720
You are inherently kind and always repay favors.

228
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,639
Now that you've acknowledged your mistake
and corrected it, consider this matter closed.

229
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,119
But in the future, don't act foolishly again.

230
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:43,179
Also, if you find Jiang Chang Yang
taking risks for me again in the future,

231
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,440
don't hide it for him again.

232
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,790
Yes,

233
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,179
Chang Yang also comforted me before, saying that you would not abandon me.

234
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,519
He understands you better than anyone else.

235
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,839
Mu Dan, now that you know the whole story,
don't be sad anymore.

236
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,499
Chang Yang truly cherishes you.

237
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,699
I know. Drink your tea.

238
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:12,640

239
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,379
What did you say?

240
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,939
I said I want to learn some martial arts.

241
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:21,699
Since you are idle at home, why not teach me?

242
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:24,219
You have no foundation. It won't work.

243
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,659
There are no stupid students, only lazy teachers.

244
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,060
Watch this move.

245
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,040
How can you learn like this?

246
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,659
Why not?

247
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,019
When you taught me how to use a slingshot,
didn't you praise my arm strength?

248
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:43,480
Besides, I'm not a girl
who never steps out of the door.

249
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,620
I often lifted stone locks before.

250
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,100
If Fu can practice martial arts, why can't I?

251
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,639
Fu has been practicing since childhood.

252
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:51,440
It's not too late for me to start now.

253
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,019
Considering the path I am taking now,

254
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,900
if I have some martial arts skills,
I can protect myself in critical moments.

255
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,540
Fine, but don't blame me
for not telling you earlier.

256
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,440
If you want to make some progress,
it'll take at least three to five years.

257
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,259
And physical suffering is guaranteed.

258
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:12,499
Don't worry. Who am I?

259
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,879
I am He Wei Fang, and I am not afraid of hardship.

260
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,919
Swing forward, and use
your right hand to block the attack.

261
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:24,900
Use your left hand to attack their abdomen.

262
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,499
No, your lower body isn't stable.

263
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,499
Why don't you switch to a lighter move?

264
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,639
Who says I don't have a stable base?

265
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:47,340
You've practiced for half a day, so have some tea.

266
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,499
By the way, do you still have
the broken hairpin Liu Lang broke?

267
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,140
I am a stingy person.

268
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,280
Why don't you return the broken hairpin to me?
I'll find someone to fix it with gold.

269
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,219
Whether I wear it myself or pawn it,
it won't be wasted.

270
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,140
Keeping a broken hairpin is unlucky.
I've already thrown it away.

271
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,979
Since it was a token of gratitude for saving
Fragrance Garden, I accept the sentiment.

272
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:43,240
You don't need to spend any more.

273
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,679
You threw it away?

274
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,499
This year's cold spell in Spring is quite cold.
Why did you mess with the heater?

275
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:26,619
Come in.

276
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,620
Jiang Chang Yang, the heater
in my room is broken. It's really cold.

277
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,200
I need to stay over at your place for a night.

278
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:58,259
Is this better?

279
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,620
Good night, then. I'll sleep in the side room.

280
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,219
Wait a minute. Everyone knows I've come here.

281
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:13,660
If you leave me here alone, they'll think that we're on bad terms.

282
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,319
What, are you shy?

283
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,060
The Floral Envoy has seen it all,
performing so many scenes.

284
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,219
Are you afraid of this scene?

285
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,559
Of course not.

286
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,539
Well, you can sleep first,
and I'll read for a while.

287
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,599
Did Xue Xi write you a letter?
I wonder how she's doing.

288
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,000
Sometimes no news is good news.

289
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,179
When she left, she gave me a secret gift.

290
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,060
Do you know what it is?

291
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,179
I don't want to get involved
in the secrets between you women.

292
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,040
You don't want to or you don't dare to?

293
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:21,580
You were busy with business and martial arts.

294
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,520
Aren't you tired? Go rest quickly.

295
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,820
How can I rest in such a bright room?

296
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,240
Now you can sleep peacefully, right?

297
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,659
I'll continue reading.

298
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:03,659
Wait, reading in such dim light,
you might go blind.

299
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,300
Alright, let's sleep together.
I won't take advantage of you.

300
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,000
What are you afraid of?

301
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,380
What have you been looking at?
There's nothing up there.

302
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,459
Jiang Chang Yang, if you can't sleep,

303
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:44,599
why don't we chat like we did
last time in the palace?

304
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:51,419
Talking is exhausting. I need to go
to the palace tomorrow to see Mr. Third.

305
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,419
Why not go enjoy the moon?

306
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,480
Stop fussing, opening the window
will let all the warmth out.

307
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,979
Didn't Chun adjust your body well before?

308
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:10,079
If you're so afraid of the cold,
you should soak in hot springs more in the future.

309
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,839
Jiang Chang Yang.

310
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:25,019
I really want to see those unlit river lanterns.

311
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,720
They must be more beautiful
than the full moon on the 15th, right?

312
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,319
Alright, good night.

313
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,340
How dare you come to see me again?
You have truly disappointed me.

314
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,340
As long as Your Majesty can relieve your anger,
I am willing to be beaten to death today.

315
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,459
You are simply taking advantage
of my usual indulgence for you.

316
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:36,100
Although I am no longer the Floral Envoy,
I still think of Your Majesty every day.

317
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,240
The work-entertainment balance is important
to your health and the stability of society.

318
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:46,939
I have found ten top-quality fighting roosters
with unique feather patterns for Your Majesty.

319
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:50,420
Would you be willing to take a look?

320
00:30:01,879 --> 00:30:04,290
You are quite thoughtful.

321
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,980
- Brew two more cups of tea.
- Yes.

322
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,079
Mr. Third, Lu Chu is dead.

323
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,840
Assistant Minister Lu chose to expose this,

324
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,850
fully aware that it might cost him his life.

325
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,000
Take good care of his wife and children for me.

326
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,760
Last night, they were drowned
in the Wei River by Prince Ning.

327
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,080
What?

328
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,680
Prince Ning wants to use his family's death
to intimidate other court officials.

329
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,520
I should have sent his wife and children
out of Chang'an before the incident occurred.

330
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,959
We were afraid of alerting the enemy at that time.

331
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:13,159
I didn't expect Prince Ning to be so ruthless.

332
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,340
Sui Zhi, I don't want to wait any longer.

333
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,680
Our people are successively
taking positions in various departments.

334
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,699
As long as the imperial examination system reform
is smoothly implemented.

335
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:32,440
After the Spring Exam, morale will be boosted,
making it the right time to act.

336
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,480
Won't it be too hasty?

337
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,839
Our people have just secured real power,
and the foundation is still unstable.

338
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,219
We cannot miss this opportunity.

339
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:46,900
If we wait any longer, I'm afraid Prince Ning
will plant his men in the court again.

340
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,720
With General Yu Chang's army in Hedong,
we will have nothing to worry about.

341
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:57,119
The deathday of the late emperor is approaching,
and General Yu was as close as a brother to him.

342
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,599
Now that the border is peaceful, he can bring
his troops to pay respects to the late emperor,

343
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,240
report the peaceful and prosperous situation,
and fulfill the duty of a loyal subject.

344
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,280
It's reasonable and proper.

345
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,380
Send the message to Hedong.

346
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,220
Yes.

347
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,599
Are you worried about Mu Dan's safety?

348
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:29,100
Before we take action,
I will send her away to ensure her safety.

349
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,860
You have known him for a long time,
so surely you are aware of his past.

350
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:39,300
Why does he always keep people at a distance,
facing everything alone?

351
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:44,419
Has Sui Zhi mentioned Princess Shouchang to you?

352
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,060
When he entered the palace at a young age,
Princess Shouchang treated him kindly.

353
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,459
After losing his mother,
he became even more unruly.

354
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:02,879
Whenever he fought with others,
Princess Shouchang would protect him.

355
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:08,939
In his heart, Princess Shouchang was not only
an elder sister but also a closest relative.

356
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,120
Is the princess's death also related to him?

357
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,940
He is not the mastermind, but he blames himself
and has never been able to let it go.

358
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,639
That year,

359
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,060
Mengzhou was hit by a natural disaster,
and he was worried about his hometown.

360
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:33,160
So he suggested that the Prince Mr. Third
and Princess Shouchang go on an incognito trip.

361
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,760
The one in charge of disaster relief
that year was Prince Ning.

362
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,659
Prince Ning reported that the relief was timely
and the affected citizens received help.

363
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:51,620
But when they arrived in Mengzhou,
they found it was like hell on earth.

364
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,760
His Majesty was furious,
wanting to punish the local officials.

365
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,780
Sui Zhi was worried that revealing their identity
would make them cover up the evidence,

366
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,620
so he proposed to secretly gather evidence
and directly submit it to the Dali Temple,

367
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,440
catching the corrupt officials off guard.

368
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,060
But they didn't know
that their movements had already been exposed.

369
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Prince Ning sent someone
disguised as a victim to start a fire.

370
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:25,300
Sui Zhi desperately saved Mr. Third
but could not save Princess Shouchang.

371
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,680
He watched helplessly
as the Princess was consumed by the fire.

372
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,919
Execute.

373
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,680
What made Sui Zhi even more helpless

374
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,600
was that the grave crime against the Princess
was pinned on several innocent disaster victims.

375
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,680
They were accused of trying
to steal disaster relief grain,

376
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,139
starting a fire, and causing chaos,
implicating the Princess.

377
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,952
Sui Zhi felt intense guilt for the tragic deaths
of the Princess and those victims before his eyes.

378
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:57,119
He's had an intense hatred for corrupt officials
after witnessing misery everywhere.

379
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,939
So that's when he decided

380
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,619
to become the Floral Envoy
defamed across the world.

381
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:17,120
No wonder he was so afraid of fire.

382
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,419
Sui Zhi feels ashamed, believing that he
owes his life to the royal family.

383
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,280
He thought he wasn't worthy
of having any personal desires.

384
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:28,439
But I can see that he cherishes you.

385
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:32,960
It is precisely because of this love
that he is extremely afraid.

386
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,660
He fears that you might be innocently implicated,
just like Princess Shouchang.

387
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,560
But I am not afraid.

388
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,080
He has punished himself
for so many years, and it's enough.

389
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm here, and I will not let him suffer anymore.

390
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:36,900
Come to my courtyard,
have some wine, and enjoy the moon.

391
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,180
By the way, I have something to tell you.

392
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,099
The moon gate there is poorly positioned.
We have to take a detour every time.

393
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,900
It needs to be fixed someday.

394
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,120
I've had a long day, so I'll pass.

395
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,170
Excuse me.

396
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,380
From now on, nothing will stand between us.

397
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,120
Jiang Chang Yang, my feelings for you

398
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,140
are inescapable and unavoidable.

399
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,780
You once said

400
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:57,700
that if I were ever in trouble,
you would come to save me upon this signal.

401
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,099
But do you know

402
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,739
that I am drawn to you
not because you can protect me,

403
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,019
but because you are the shameless
and audacious Jiang Chang Yang,

404
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,419
who has great righteousness in his heart
but conceals it with a cavalier attitude.

405
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:16,780
You have formed a temperament
that I like in all aspects.

406
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,119
Consort Shu has already told me
about all your troubles and matters.

407
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:36,680
Given the current situation,
being by my side is a significant risk for you.

408
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,780
I understand that.

409
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,419
The great endeavor of yours is dangerous,
so you dare not come close to me.

410
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,419
But I am not afraid.

411
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,240
Whether this step, or a hundred steps,
is a blessing or a curse,

412
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,539
I will come to you.

413
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:02,560
Even if I will get you killed?

414
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:08,800
From now on, there is no you and me.

415
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,519
We will be true spouses, true family.

416
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,300
I will create a peaceful
and prosperous era with you.

417
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:35,959
When I was young, I arrogantly believed
that I could protect many people.

418
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,240
In the end, I watched them die tragically.

419
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:49,939
There's no guarantee of success in my endeavor.

420
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,416
I can repay the debts I owe with my life.

421
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,780
 â™« If love is like frost â™«

422
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,380
But I shouldn't drag you along in it.

423
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:04,796
 â™« Can they eventually â™«

424
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:10,559
 â™« Touch the clear skies â™«

425
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,520
Why can't selfish desires
and the greater good coexist?

426
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,780
â™« â™«

427
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,630
Jiang Chang Yang,

428
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,000
why don't you dare to try?

429
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:29,190
The world is vast,

430
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,350
so why lose your life
trapped in Chang'an because of me?

431
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,850
Let go of me,

432
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,830
and open Wuyong Hall
across the country as soon as possible.

433
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,008
That is the life He Wei Fang deserves.

434
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:53,740
 â™« If love is like frost â™«

435
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,039
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm telling you,
I will not give up.

436
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,599
- I'm not afraid of death.
 - But I am.

437
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,900
 â™« I go forward â™«

438
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,879
I'm afraid you'll die.

439
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:12,344
 â™« The night is dark as if ink poured out â™«

440
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:17,152
 â™« I've had a hidden life,
like duckweed stricken by the rain â™«

441
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:21,495
 â™« I still remember the battle music of Lanling â™«

442
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:27,365
 â™« I can still hear the war drums today â™«
