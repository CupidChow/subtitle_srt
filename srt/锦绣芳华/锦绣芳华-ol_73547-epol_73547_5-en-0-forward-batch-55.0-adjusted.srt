2
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,074

3
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:36,020

4
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,759
But you are here. How can I possibly stay out of it?

5
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,399
I cannot intervene with the nobility,

6
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:46,209
but I can handle things outside the palace. I can help you find the peddler.

7
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,720
The opponent has surely fully prepared to frame me. How could they let you find a flaw?

8
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,059
I have my own way to resolve it.

9
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,259
Before I leave, stay well in the Jiang Residence and do not show yourself.

10
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,680
Be wary of Liu Chang and the County Princess.

11
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,619
It's Prince Ning and his men again.

12
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,619
Don't worry. I will take good care of myself.

13
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,260
But Prince Ning has been on good terms with you. Is it because of me this time?

14
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,928
This time, it's aimed at me. It has nothing to do with you.

15
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,020
Don't worry, these traps won't nail me down.

16
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,176
They just want to trap me here, probably to test something.

17
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,619
Just leave the flowers here. Stop moving them around.

18
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:36,619
They look quite nice.

19
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,819
I have nothing to hide. Let Liu Chang do whatever he wants.

20
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,300
I am happy to relax here for two days.

21
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,740
You really don't need to worry about me.

22
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,279
I saw him at a banquet at Jiang's residence. Where is he taking the Financial Clerk?

23
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,480
They are heading west.

24
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,420
Oh no, it's Wanguan Hall. They are going to check Jiang Chang Yang's private accounts.

25
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,180
Go and inform Yun Niang. I'll go and stall Liu Chang.

26
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,079
- All right.
 - Go quickly.

27
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,339
- Madam, are you alright?
 - Madam, I'll take you to the clinic.

28
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,740
Make way, make way.

29
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,640
He Wei Fang?

30
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Young Master.

31
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,859
Are you hurt?

32
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:08,499
I… I just accidentally fell and twisted my ankle. I can't walk.

33
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,940
Could you take me to Tranquil Health Clinic?

34
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,239
Sure.

35
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,260
This is not the road to Tranquil Health Clinic.

36
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,620
Proud as you are, you've learned to bow your head to me for Jiang Chang Yang.

37
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:47,280
Since you already knew, why did you still let me get in the carriage?

38
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,744
It's rare for you to come to me.

39
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:55,400
No matter the reason, I am willing to spend more time with you at this moment.

40
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:03,179
Then can you tell me where you're taking me now?

41
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,739
The wind and rain are getting stronger. I'm just taking you home.

42
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:16,060
I've also sent someone to pick up Zhu Fu to keep you company.

43
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Listen up. No one is allowed in or out.

44
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,660
 Yes, Sir.

45
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:50,480

46
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,980
- How is it?
 - Take a look.

47
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,079
 How about we agree on a secret code?

48
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,020
 If you encounter another incident or discover any unusual moves by Prince Ning,

49
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,179
 and you can't find me at the moment, you can leave a message with the code,

50
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:49,099
 and my people will see it.

51
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,659
 You're best at sneaky matters. I'll follow your lead.

52
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:57,739
 The different pictures on this palace lantern can represent our different enterprises.

53
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:02,799
 If in danger, just hang it with matching picture facing the Jiang Residence.

54
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:06,280
 The person who conveys messages in the residence will take care of it.

55
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,460
 This side represents the Huanyun Tower.

56
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,559
 This side represents the Wanguan Hall.

57
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,199
 This is Fragrance Garden.

58
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,239
 This is Floral Haven.

59
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,179
Young Master Liu, you have searched the room and checked the accounts.

60
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,160
Is there anything unusual?

61
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,199
Young Master, that person appeared at the dock again.

62
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,779
Just like the previous times, after leaving, he came to Wanguan Hall.

63
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,779
Upon seeing there were officers here, he turned and went to another shop.

64
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,580
Was he really pawning something?

65
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,539
Yes, we obtained the item he pawned.

66
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:10,620
It is a gemstone smuggled from foreign lands.

67
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:31,299
Young Master, do you not believe that person is unrelated to Jiang Chang Yang?

68
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,579
Whether I believe it or not, Prince Ning's opinion is what matters.

69
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:40,679
We must obtain concrete evidence while Jiang Chang Yang is trapped.

70
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,679
Open the door. Open the door.

71
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,679
Quick, open the door.

72
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,500
Open the door.

73
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,719
Quickly, open the door.

74
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,160
Young Master, you sent me back home, and I naturally cannot disappoint your kindness.

75
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,100
I will definitely protect my home with Jiang Chang Yang well.

76
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,159
Move aside.

77
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,079
As long as my husband is not convicted,

78
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,220
he remains the Floral Envoy and the Vice Minister of the Office of Imperial Ceremonies.

79
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,000
If you want to search here, you must ask for the imperial edict.

80
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,280
What exactly is hidden in this Jiang Residence that makes you so concerned and protective?

81
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,728
Today, I will enter this door.

82
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:46,719
Its innocence is why one as vile as you must not defile it

83
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,939
Stop. This is an imperial granted sword.

84
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,299
The blade drawn is as if His Majesty is present.

85
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,500
I dare you to make a move!

86
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:03,380
Don't act willfully for someone unworthy.

87
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Be careful not to bring disaster upon yourself, or I won't be able to save you either.

88
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,559
- He Wei Fang.
 - If you dare take another step forward,

89
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,360
I'll make sure you spill blood on the spot.

90
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,740
The poisoning case is closed.

91
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,620

92
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:37,059
Young Master, the imperial edict has arrived at Ministry of Justice.

93
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,179
The Vice Minister's improper appointment of personnel bears the fault of negligence.

94
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,840
A three-year salary reduction was issued as a warning to others.

95
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,919
Young Master has returned. Young Master has returned.

96
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,260
Miss Xiao is so impressive. She merely said something and saved Young Master.

97
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,100
After all, she is the daughter of a Military Governor.

98
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,240
She had the Princess plead on her behalf. What crime can't be cleared with that?

99
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,080
- Young Madam.
 - Young Madam.

100
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,559
- Let's go back first.
 - Oh, we're going back.

101
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,239
Yes, yes.

102
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,900
You didn't even greet your husband. What a heartless concubine.

103
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,620
Well, did you bring my peonies back?

104
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,020
No matter what I forget, I dare not forget your flowers.

105
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,340
Later, I'll have Chuan Yu bring them for you.

106
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,959
It's so good to be home.

107
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:38,039
The poisoning case ended in such a muddled way.

108
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,819
The witnesses involved either took their own lives or were silenced.

109
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:44,900
The Ministry of Justice found nothing.

110
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,260
Moreover, the intrigue and rivalry among concubines are nothing new.

111
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,720
There are plenty of such unresolvable cases.

112
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,819
Prince Ning found no evidence.

113
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,620
Seeing the Princess plead, it was difficult for him to obstruct.

114
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,299
This matter was greatly aided by Xue Xi. You really ought to thank her properly.

115
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:10,160
And what about you? How should I thank your great assistance?

116
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,040
Compared to Xue Xi, what I did was insignificant.

117
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,539
The famous businesswoman He in the capital is not someone who underestimates herself.

118
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,280
I am neither ashamed nor humble. I just feel somewhat powerless.

119
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:37,740
You once said I was a cunning fox that could overcome any difficulty.

120
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,939
But no matter how hard a fox tries, it can only handle matters on the shore.

121
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:49,839
When it comes to an injured fish in the water, even if I want to save it, I am powerless.

122
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,939
But Xue Xi is different. She has a similar background to yours.

123
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:59,620
She can look after you and support you.

124
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:05,059
You both live in the same lake.

125
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:17,779
Mu Dan, where they are born does not determine their preferences.

126
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,220
How do you know I'm not another fox that accidentally fell into the water?

127
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,559
Perhaps what I really need is for my companion to give me a hand from the shore.

128
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,699
These days, you have worried and run around for me.

129
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:44,860
You sent a message to Miss Yun, letting Liu Chang see the fake account book I wanted him to see.

130
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,140
To stop Liu Chang from searching the mansion, you bravely held the imperial sword to his neck,

131
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,980
forcing his men to draw their swords.

132
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,740
Every single matter was a helping hand aiding me ashore.

133
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,539
You have the eyes of a clairvoyant.

134
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:12,439
Even in prison, you knew so much.

135
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:18,032
Yes, I do. So, even if you don't say things, I know.

136
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:23,568
♫  Should my heart have frost, would the past remain forever frozen?  ♫

137
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:29,599
You disregarded the risk of being implicated and did so much for me.

138
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,840
Thank you.

139
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,579
♫  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  ♫

140
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,800
You said it before that there's no need for thanks between us.

141
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,900
Then, you're responsible for dinner today. Hurry up and start the stove.

142
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,859
I'll go bathe first. Call me when it's ready.

143
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,660

144
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:21,319
Liu Chang found She Yan was a thief fencing stolen goods at Wanguan Hall.

145
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,860
Prince Ning did not succeed.

146
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,779
He also let us remove the spy he planted next to Consort Shu.

147
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,659
In the past, when he meddled with the inner palace, I could let it slide.

148
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:35,059
But this time, he tried to poison Ling Ge.

149
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,220
If Mu Dan didn't say anything, Ling Ge would be…

150
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,299
I'm afraid establishing the Crown Prince has completely unsettled him.

151
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,719
For the safety of Ling Ge and Prince Lang, let's not mention this for now.

152
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,419
The inner palace is not like other courtyards.

153
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,499
Your Majesty can take this opportunity to thoroughly investigate the palace servants.

154
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:06,019
Exercise more caution in the future to prevent such dangerous incidents.

155
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,060
Although Prince Ning didn't find anything,

156
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,380
I'm afraid his naturally suspicious nature will only deepen his mistrust.

157
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,039
If Prince Ning grows fully suspicious, he won’t act so lightly.

158
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,340
Last night, I received an apology gift from Prince Ning's Residence,

159
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,060
saying his son-in-law behaved inappropriately and startled my household.

160
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,060
He also said he wanted to enter the palace to plead for me, but someone beat him to it.

161
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,419
Smooth talk and flattering words.

162
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,739
Fortunately, Xue Xi went to the Princess, so I took the opportunity to release you.

163
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:45,100
Otherwise, he’d have claimed credit, and who knows how he’d make you repay him.

164
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,979
The probe against me was proposed and carried out by Liu Chang.

165
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:53,340
If Prince Ning is suspicious, he won't target only me.

166
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,520
Liu Chang hasn't found any concrete evidence.

167
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,219
So, if he still insists,

168
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,939
Prince Ning will only suspect that he's targeting me because of Mu Dan.

169
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:06,300
Moreover, I just helped his man secure the position of Minister of Revenue.

170
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,660
This tangible advantage is more credible than a few baseless speculations by Liu Chang.

171
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,219
How is the investigation into the canal transportation going?

172
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,979
Before General Yu arrives, all corrupt officials in the Ministry of Revenue must be removed.

173
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,259
She Yan has already found Prince Ning's smuggled goods.

174
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:25,760
Now they are investigating where these items were transported to.

175
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,200
What are these mysterious items?

176
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:51,179
Consort Shu has returned to the palace. Increased vigilance makes it hard to act again.

177
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:57,879
I'm afraid the Floral Envoy will also bear a grudge against me.

178
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,939
Liu Zi Shu, you truly are a good son-in-law to me.

179
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:08,780
We haven't searched the Jiang Residence,

180
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,530
and it's unclear if Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

181
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,219
What do you think?

182
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,599
Your Highness.

183
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,459
Everyone in Pingkang House knows the Floral Envoy.

184
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:31,960
Every rake of the foremost noble families has attended the banquets at the Jiang Residence.

185
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,459
Zi Shu, have you seen the grandeur of gift receptions at the Jiang Residence?

186
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,919
For someone as greedy and self-indulgent, I don't believe he is plotting revenge.

187
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:49,100
My son has recently become obsessed with cockfighting.

188
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,860
He found out that Jiang Chang Yang has taken all the high-quality ones to the palace.

189
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,979
His Majesty chose several members of the imperial guard to raise chickens.

190
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,499
They have been doing it for quite some time.

191
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:04,380
Could all these years have been a guise?

192
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,340
It's precisely because he has been consistent for many years.

193
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,240
We should thoroughly investigate whether Jiang Chang Yang has ulterior motives.

194
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,308
If he truly had ambitions, why hasn't he married a noblewoman who could assist him?

195
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:22,780
With the help of noble families, isn't it easier to get things done?

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,200
Given today's circumstances, I'm afraid Xue Xi already has feelings for Jiang Chang Yang.

197
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,559
Hurry up, and make sure to claim the Xiao family.

198
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
Yes.

199
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,300
Your Highness, do you truly have no doubts? How could it be such a coincidence?

200
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,240
Jiang Chang Yang was released right before I conducted the search.

201
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:59,950
A mere merchant's concubine,

202
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,090
how can she keep an important official outside the house?

203
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,639
Do you really think that I don't know your intentions?

204
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:29,580
I have no second thoughts about Your Highness or the County Princess.

205
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,599
If there are lies, I should be like this cup.

206
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,939
Jiang Chang Yang is a clever person.

207
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,630
He can both please His Majesty

208
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,870
and lend me a hand at the right time.

209
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:52,950
But precisely because of this,

210
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,860
should he become my enemy, it will be an unfathomable abyss.

211
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,879
I allowed you to investigate thoroughly. But what did you do?

212
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:08,419
You came back empty-handed, and now I have to appease him.

213
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,860
I am so sorry, Your Highness. I failed your trust this time.

214
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,659
Next time, I will not act rashly.

215
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,930
You must cherish your fragile body

216
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,250
and use the cane I gave you well. Be more alert

217
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,079
and do your work properly. Do not get injured again.

218
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,380
Your becoming a cripple would distress You Zhen.

219
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,140
I understand and will not betray your trust.

220
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:55,219
This is Dong'e County's donkey-hide gelatin awarded by the Princess. Keep it.

221
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:58,459
It's most nourishing when simmered into a soup.

222
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:00,620
Xue Xi, you are so kind.

223
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,979
You are an old acquaintance of Young Master and helped him leave the Ministry of Justice.

224
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:08,410
We should be thanking you. How come you are the one giving gifts?

225
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:15,359
Staying temporarily at the Jiang Residence was the Royal Princess's idea. I hope you don't mind.

226
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,799
Of course not, aside from Young Master, you also saved my life.

227
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,590
If my courtyard were not so small, I would have invited you to stay here with me.

228
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:29,699
Xue Xi, if you have any discomfort, just tell Jiang Chang Yang.

229
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,979
I also have everything a woman might need.

230
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:37,460
Mu Dan, you are indeed different from other women as rumored.

231
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,780
These are our newly developed perfumes.

232
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,820
Xue Xi, take a look. Take whichever you like.

233
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,860
We also have lip balm made from Herbaceous Peonies.

234
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,700
Give it a try.

235
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,280
It smells so good.

236
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,919
What is this?

237
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,739
This is a scar-removing ointment.

238
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:06,419
Does Floral Haven also sell scar-removing products?

239
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,659
Those are sold by Xiao Chun's Tranquil Health Clinic.

240
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,580
We also have medicine specifically for burns and scalds.

241
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,380
The one you are holding is specifically used for scars left by sharp objects.

242
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,739
Small scars usually disappear in about half a month with application.

243
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:27,240
That's impressive. Can it also smooth out scars that are over ten years old?

244
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,800
Over ten years? We haven't tried that.

245
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,100
For typical scars, applying medicine as soon as they form is the most effective.

246
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:43,380
Xue Xi, do you have any old scars? You can take it back and try it first.

247
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,680
If it doesn't work, I'll have Xiao Chun come over to take a look.

248
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,100
But you have reminded me.

249
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,559
We can develop another ointment for removing old scars.

250
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:05,820
Have you talked to your father about Pei Zhong?

251
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,359
Father wanted to call off the engagement, knowing who Pei Zhong really is,

252
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,000
but he's afraid of offending Prince Ning by rejecting his good intentions.

253
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,300
Prince Ning wants to befriend the Xiao family.

254
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,639
Even without Pei Zhong, there will be someone else.

255
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,359
Father often says that the court is complex and unpredictable.

256
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,780
If one can stay unaffected, that is the best.

257
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,000
If not, you should also make fewer enemies.

258
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,170
This matter is difficult to handle.

259
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,770
Father still needs some more days to think.

260
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,620
All right, now that you're staying here,

261
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,780
for the time being, it can prevent some of Pei Zhong's harassment.

262
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,180
You were close to Prince Ning before.

263
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,490
Why did he send men to check your assets when you were locked up?

264
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,960
Did you offend him in any way?

265
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,100
You should have heard that Mu Dan was once Liu Chang's wife.

266
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,699
Ever since I took her in, Liu Chang has been targeting me everywhere,

267
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,979
trying to drive a wedge between Prince Ning and me.

268
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,679
Sui Zhi, do you remember

269
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,939
when you took me to catch rabbits in the mountains when we were seven years old?

270
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:40,529
Then, you fell from halfway up the mountain and got a deep cut on your lower back.

271
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,779
You bled so much.

272
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,100
We didn't catch any rabbits, and you ended up with a very ugly scar.

273
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,939
I cried for a long time because of that.

274
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,659
Of course, I remember.

275
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:57,599
At that time, Mother was applying ointment to me while comforting you.

276
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,060
Why did you suddenly bring this up?

277
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,739
She said…

278
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:09,419
this scar is hidden under clothes, and no one but family can see it.

279
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,800
Only then did I stop crying.

280
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,599
But Mu Dan doesn't know that you have such a scar.

281
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,159
Do you have a fake marriage?

282
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,300
You're insightful and perceptive. You figured it out so quickly.

283
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,680
Why did you do it?

284
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:45,100
At that time, Mu Dan was in danger. To save her life, I had no choice but to do this.

285
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,380
And by having a beloved wife, I can also avoid some unwanted marriages.

286
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,520
Killing two birds with one stone.

287
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,879
I see.

288
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,960
Please keep this a secret for us, Xue Xi.

289
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,319
Don't worry. No one else will know.

290
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,960
 During the Dragon Boat Festival, Floral Haven sets up the Zuixiang Pavilion in Fragrance Garden

291
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,680
 with rare and exotic goods. Only fifty pieces are available daily.

292
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,799
 Once sold out, it's over.

293
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,580
Please line up properly. Ladies, how many of you are there?

294
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,480
Give me one.

295
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:39,768

296
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:42,896

297
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:45,428

298
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,799

299
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,660

300
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,930

301
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,879
 Before the garden closes, Floral Haven will put the remaining goods into a mystery lucky bag,

302
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:04,699
 which has more value than its price and can't be missed.

303
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:06,808

304
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,567

305
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,663
 Huamanzhu will record your spendings.

306
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:21,414
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

307
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:24,659
♫  And never withering  ♫

308
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,219
Dear customers,

309
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:31,219
the top 10 spenders can have priority in choosing the premium flowers during winter.

310
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:32,939
Please enjoy your shopping here.

311
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,699
 Sure.

312
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:39,019
The winter flowers are just plum blossoms, ink orchids, daffodils, and pomegranate blooms.

313
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:43,179
What's new? What's the difference between choosing sooner or later?

314
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:44,920
Young Master Tang, you might not know,

315
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,360
at the beginning of the Fragrance Garden renewal, we specifically set aside a row of houses

316
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,060
and built a greenhouse for cultivating rare peonies.

317
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,559
We studied for a long time to cultivate peonies that can bloom in winter.

318
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,380
There are such rare items in Floral Haven.

319
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,499
Young Madam, please help me check if my spending is in the top ten.

320
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:03,060
- Sure.
 - Mu Dan.

321
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,219
Today, we picked a lot. We're going to pay the bill.

322
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,719
All right.

323
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,140
These noble ladies need cosmetic items every day, so their spendings are high.

324
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,440
You gentlemen should also strive to keep up.

325
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,459
Here, I still need ten of these.

326
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,940
- 10 of these.
 - And that one too.

327
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:25,659
How is the incense powder? Do you like the fragrance?

328
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:26,860
I do.

329
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,160
Please feel free to try more.

330
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,259
- All right.
 - Look how beautiful these small flowers are.

331
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:34,059
- Madam, come again next time.
 - Sure.

332
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,399
Shopkeeper, three boxes of bath beans and incense powder for a total of 200 wen.

333
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:49,739
Liu Chang is coming. Run.

334
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:08,699
May I ask if He Wei Fang is here?

335
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:11,979
No. Young Master Liu, please go home.

336
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,420
It doesn't matter if she's not here. I'm here to buy something.

337
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,740
Qiu Shi.

338
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,760
Your Highness, embroider tomorrow. Be careful not to hurt your eyes.

339
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,660
Your Highness.

340
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:44,979
Young Master carried several boxes of women's items to the Taoguang Courtyard today.

341
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,159
Floral Haven.

342
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,499
It's He Wei Fang again.

343
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,240
You know exactly how many cold looks your mother has given me, both openly and secretly.

344
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,119
Now, even a lowly concubine dares to embarrass me.

345
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,380
Miss Man is a noble concubine from the Lu family of Fan Yang.

346
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,340
Now she is pregnant, and you should give way to her, you know?

347
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,300
Why can't you give way to me? Today is my birthday.

348
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,580
If you don't stay with me overnight, everyone in the residence will laugh at me.

349
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,179
You haven't gotten pregnant yet, so why should I care about your face?

350
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:54,960
You can't leave. You can't. You just can't.

351
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,140
Foolish woman.

352
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,179
Ping Zhi, how are you? Are you well?

353
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,179
I'll call someone for you.

354
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,179
I'll divorce you, venomous woman.

355
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:38,279
The weather is dry and prone to fires.

356
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,680
Once the fire burns everything, nothing will be left.

357
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,459
- Madam Tang.
 - Is it delicious? Come, Xiao Chun.

358
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:03,040
- Thank you, Da Fu.
 - And yours too.

359
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,028
- Thanks. Another bonus.
 - That's so nice.

360
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:10,700
Everyone, during the Dragon Boat Festival, our prosperity was thanks to all of you here.

361
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Tonight, let's drink to our hearts' content and rest well for a few days.

362
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,579
Here's to everyone.

363
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:18,700
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

364
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,400
Come on.

365
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,619
Shopkeeper, Young Master Jiang has sent something.

366
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,120
Come on, bring it over quickly.

367
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,740
- Put it here, put it here.
- It's from Young Master Jiang.

368
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,560
There are so many.

369
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,939
Young Madam, Young Master understands the hardships you've endured.

370
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:40,240
He especially went to Prosperity House and carefully selected these fine wines and foods

371
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,619
for everyone in the Fragrance Garden to enjoy together.

372
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,459
Young Madam, there are still several boxes outside.

373
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,939
I'll distribute them to each courtyard and take my leave for now.

374
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,239
Thank you.

375
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,660
 Thank you, Young Master.

376
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,880
Many thanks, Young Master.

377
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,280
- So nice.
 - Alright now.

378
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,639
The Floral Envoy is being generous for once. Everyone, come and try it.

379
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,820
- Quickly.
 - Bring that chicken over to me.

380
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,039
- I can't even snatch from them.
 - Just wait to eat.

381
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,340
Why are you acting so distant today?

382
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,099
Having such a considerate husband is rare, so why don't you return home early?

383
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,419
How could I?

384
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:17,139
I promised to drink with you today, so how can I go back on my word?

385
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,820
You have been staying here these days.

386
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,340
Young Master must miss you greatly. Quickly, go home.

387
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,200
This one night won't make a difference. I'll check the peonies in the greenhouse.

388
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,579
Father has already checked them, and he said the new peonies you cultivated are thriving well.

389
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,019
One night won't make a difference.

390
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,700
Xiao Chun. Xiao Chun, come on.

391
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,180
Why is there so much food?

392
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,280
It's all from Young Master Jiang.

393
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,180
- Liu Lang, go and eat quickly.
 - All right.

394
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,939
Liu Lang, Liu Lang, come on.

395
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:48,579
Mu Dan, even if you're not going, you should at least send your regards.

396
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,740
I have a sparring match with Chuan Yu, and I'll return to Jiang Residence shortly.

397
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,280
If you have something to tell him, I'll pass it on.

398
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,459
Come on, let's drink together.

399
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,740
- Madam Tang, let's drink.
 - Come on. Cheers.

400
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,139
- Come on.
 - Alright.

401
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,459
Come on. Dig in.

402
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,300
Here, have some dishes.

403
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,399
"Thinking of you is like the daylily, seeing it dispels worries."

404
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:24,839
How did the busy shopkeeper He think of me, and even brought supper over?

405
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:35,180
This is to thank you for treating everyone at Fragrance Garden to the food of Prosperity House.

406
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,300
This is Mu Dan expressing gratitude for her husband's care.

407
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,419
She also recited a line of poetry.

408
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,730
Thinking of you is like this grass something,

409
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,020
something about dispelling worries.

410
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,560
If you want to send flowers, just say so. Why lie?

411
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,380
When did I invite her people to Prosperity House?

412
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,240
Wait, didn't you send food with a servant?

413
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,479
There was a total of ten boxes for everyone at the Fragrance Garden.

414
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,660
I didn't do anything.

415
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,160
Have you seen the servant who delivered the gifts?

416
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,939
Did you check the contents of the boxes? Are they all food and drinks?

417
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:24,300
Mu Dan and I only checked two boxes, and the rest were distributed to other rooms.

418
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,540
What? It's not from you?

419
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,460
Oh no.

420
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,980
Let's go.

421
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:17,380

422
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,840
She secretly sent people to spy on me.

423
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,740
Even though she knows I haven't seen Mu Dan,

424
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,000
she still wants to kill someone.

425
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,099
Truly malicious.

426
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:35,039
You were so worried you rushed to rescue them without changing your official attire.

427
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,419
Why don't you go in now?

428
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:43,700
A heaven-sent opportunity for me to be a hero and save the damsel.

429
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,460
I should wait for the fire to burn a bit more intensely.

430
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,039
Quickly, put out the fire, quickly.

431
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,939
 Somebody, please.

432
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,439
 Somebody, please.

433
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,000
Stop there.

434
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,259
You're not allowed to go.

435
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,300
I've had enough of these days.

436
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,740
Only when she's dead will you turn back and look at me.

437
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,059
Didn't you bring these days upon yourself?

438
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:45,219
If you hadn't started this fire, I wouldn't have come here.

439
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,450
You are my husband.

440
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,120
If I won't let you in, you are not allowed to step into this Fragrance Garden.

441
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,139
It's not up to you.

442
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,780
You've come just in time.

443
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:02,139
Watch with me as she burns into charcoal and turns to ashes in this great fire.

444
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:06,359
This way, you'll give up, and you'll be with me forever.

445
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,979
Quickly, Shopkeeper, get out.

446
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:27,380
Shopkeeper, go out first.

447
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,839
- Madam Tang, hurry.
 - Quickly, you go out first.

448
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,939
Get out first.

449

♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

466
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:24,420
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫
