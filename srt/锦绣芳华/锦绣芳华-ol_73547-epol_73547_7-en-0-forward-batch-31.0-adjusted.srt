00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:08,020

3
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,000

4
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,359
Excuse me, is that the dilapidated house beside the garden?

5
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,900
What dilapidated house? That's our residence.

6
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,676
What's the matter?

7
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,180
Are you two from the Imperial Workshop? Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

8
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,699
Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

9
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,440
Indeed, Miss Xiao likes pavilions and towers.

10
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,419
The Royal Princess sent us to inspect here.

11
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,280
She said to demolish two dilapidated houses by the garden, dig a channel for water,

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
and build a water pavilion for Miss Xiao to enjoy.

13
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,679
This is the Floral Envoy's residence, not Miss Xiao's home.

14
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,339
Why is it to be built at the Jiang Residence?

15
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,599
They're childhood sweethearts and well-matched. With the Royal Princess match-making,

16
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,920
since both of us were sent, surely something good is about to happen.

17
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,728
Excuse me.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,539
Looks like our home is going to become a water channel.

19
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,759
Mu Dan, enough with this.

20
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,619
This is a big matter, you should ask Jiang Chang Yang.

21
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,180
Sister, it's okay. Let's go back and live in Fragrance Garden.

22
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,399
There are many houses and beautiful scenery everywhere.

23
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,580
- Also me and Da Fu…
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

24
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,180
I'll ask them after the birthday is over.

25
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,520
Let's finish these tasks first. Come on.

26
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:32,639
People have paid. Hurry up.

27
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,300
Sister, you're so impressive.

28
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,092
Let's go.

29
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,480
Wait a moment.

30
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,900

31
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,290

32
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,668
Sui Zhi.

33
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,550

34
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:11,384
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

35
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:15,344
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

36
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:19,312
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

37
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:24,408
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

38
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,380
Xue Xi, you're drunk.

39
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,348
I'm not drunk.

40
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:41,040
I've been holding some words back for years.

41
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,199
Are you willing to listen?

42
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:51,488
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

43
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,736
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

44
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,900
The poem you taught me.

45
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,100
I was young then and didn't understand the meaning.

46
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,619
- But now…
 - I was also young then.

47
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:15,760
This isn't what I meant.

48
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,579
But I've had a crush on you since childhood.

49
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,312
Unfortunately, we were separated.

50
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:33,939
I thought there was no possibility for us, so I gave up the idea.

51
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,240
But who knew that I would come to Chang'an and see you again?

52
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,420
For my family,

53
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:54,419
I've thought about listening to my parents and trying to be with Pei Zhong.

54
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,459
But the closer I got to others, the more I realized I couldn't do it.

55
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,760
The person in my heart has always been you.

56
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,040
Back then, my mother always wanted a daughter,

57
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,500
so she treated you like one.

58
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,579
I also regarded you as family.

59
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,880
I know you have no feelings for me.

60
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,440
But if I have to marry someone, I'd rather marry you.

61
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,459
Even though we haven't seen each other for many years,

62
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,240
the familiarity and friendship of the old days remain.

63
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,419
Being with you, I feel very at ease and comfortable.

64
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,880
I believe you feel the same.

65
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:59,059
Sui Zhi, you'll have a wife eventually.

66
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,579
And I'm the most suitable choice.

67
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,930
Xue Xi.

68
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,530
I'll always be your elder brother.

69
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,520
But I won't marry you.

70
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,340
I don't want to ruin your lifetime of happiness.

71
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,319
I toast to you with this cup.

72
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,479
Happy Birthday.

73
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,100
May you soon find someone to love mutually,

74
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,000
and that you'll never be separated.

75
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:01,130

76
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,699
I've said it many times.

77
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,380
The Royal Princess's orders have no authority over my residence.

78
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,980
There is absolutely no possibility of renovating the backyard.

79
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,419
Vice Minister Jiang, the Royal Princess insists on doing this for Miss Xiao.

80
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:22,020
With you like this, it makes it really hard for me to report back.

81
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Please report back to the Royal Princess

82
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,020
and say that I stayed in the Jiang Residence earlier to catch up with an old friend.

83
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,220
Today, I'm leaving the residence to relax.

84
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,740
When I return, I'll stay with the Royal Princess to keep her company.

85
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,880
Yes, thank you very much, Miss Xiao.

86
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,660
Excuse us.

87
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,968
You're leaving?

88
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:00,380
Now that I've come to Chang'an, I want to stroll around,

89
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,539
visit famous mountains and temples, soak in the hot springs.

90
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,679
It's better than being trapped in this square residence.

91
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,819
I don't want to be an extra person.

92
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,230
Sui Zhi.

93
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,459
May you also discern your feelings.

94
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,308
Don't miss out.

95
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:55,224

96
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,340
- Xue Xi.
 - Mu Dan.

97
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,220
Are you going on a long journey?

98
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,819
I'm going to Mount Li to soak in the hot springs.

99
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:18,459
Sui Zhi has some important matters to handle.

100
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,779
I hope everything will be resolved by the time I return.

101
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,079
But no matter what, it won't affect our friendship.

102
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,324
Of course.

103
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:31,860
Rest assured. He's one thing, and our friendship is another.

104
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,220
I would never let you be concerned or troubled.

105
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Nor will I develop feelings of rivalry or jealousy.

106
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

107
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,340
Do you like Sui Zhi?

108
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,679
Xue Xi, please do not misunderstand.

109
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,740
Jiang Chang Yang and I are only in a cooperative relationship.

110
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,900
There's nothing more beyond that.

111
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:05,819
Floral Haven has just developed some new bath beans and incense.

112
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,659
You can use them while soaking in the hot springs.

113
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,179
Before leaving the city, come with me to Floral Haven to pick some.

114
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,779
- It's on the house.
- Okay.

115
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,140
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

116
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,500
When I received this broken hairpin, I should have understood her intentions.

117
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,419
But I think Young Madam treats you well.

118
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,559
She treats me as a confidant.

119
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:45,688
She didn't say it out loud

120
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:49,920
because she's worried we can get along like we did before.

121
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,920
Why should I unnecessarily cause her more trouble?

122
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,090
You're here?

123
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,670
Have a seat.

124
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:03,719
It's our last time having a late-night snack, so we should drink to our heart's content.

125
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,479
Nothing happened, so why is this the last time?

126
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,199
With Fragrance Garden under renovation, there's a lot of things to do.

127
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,520
I've been running back and forth all day and I'm really tired.

128
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,299
It's more relaxing to live there.

129
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,408
Okay.

130
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:35,319
But this room will be empty anyway.

131
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,100
If you're not busy... you can come back anytime.

132
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,908
I won't come back.

133
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:54,459
Thank you, Master Jiang for taking care of me during this time.

134
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,240
Our marriage was originally a stopgap measure.

135
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,659
We cannot delay our proper lives because of the pretense.

136
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,000
Since I'm moving out,

137
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,079
Jiang Chang Yang, write the divorce document.

138
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,072
Okay.

139
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,340
♫  Should my heart have frost, would the past remain forever frozen?  ♫

140
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,604
♫  Falling into your gaze, melting and flowing with you  ♫

141
00:18:55,604 --> 00:19:02,344
♫  If love were like frost, can these countless miles of stormy weather  ♫

142
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:09,624
♫  See clear skies again?  ♫

143
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:17,300
♫  Clouds hidden by the night  ♫

144
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:24,040
♫  Oh, how they drift  ♫
♫  Searching for a place to rest  ♫

145
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,079
In the future, if you need any help, just let me know.

146
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:37,968
Okay.

147
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,992
♫  If the heart were like frost, what's a lifetime of solitude?  ♫

148
00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:49,196
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

149
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:56,072
♫  If love were like frost, there would be a candle flickering in the wind  ♫

150
00:19:56,072 --> 00:20:02,520
♫  Never saying a word, but always moving towards you  ♫

151
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,240

152
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:31,459
Jiang Chang Yang, I'm afraid you're going to lose.

153
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,900

154
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,760
Jiang Chang Yang.

155
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,680
From now on, I'll give this bright moon back to you.

156
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,459
The oil merchants from the Western Regions say this is Tokhara black fire oil.

157
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,919
This type of fire oil is dark and vigorous, mostly used on the battlefield.

158
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,780
It's never sold in Chang'an's two markets.

159
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,979
Ordinary people can't recognize it at all.

160
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,079
Since it's used in warfare, it must be a prohibited item.

161
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,559
Those who can obtain this item aren't ordinary people.

162
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,760
But we haven't offended any officials recently.

163
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,000
I remembered something.

164
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,979
Days ago, Liu Chang came to Fragrance Garden and bought several boxes of cosmetics.

165
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,680
It must have angered Li You Zhen again.

166
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,780
Her again? Is she ever going to stop?

167
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,939
How can she, a dignified County Princess, harm others all day long?

168
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:19,359
The boxes delivered that day were tied with sailors' knots.

169
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,979
I've heard a group of water bandits has been hired in Chang'an recently.

170
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:25,720
They'll commit any evil act for money.

171
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,620
We can start from there.

172
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,620
First, catch the arsonist.

173
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:38,179
In any case, this time, I must make Li You Zhen admit her crime and be punished.

174
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,620
Young Master, if you don't want to write the divorce document just say so.

175
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,480
She and I were once employer and employee. Now we're allies.

176
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,599
Our relationship is quite deep. So, I must be very cautious.

177
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,079
Otherwise, if she isn't satisfied with it, I'll have to revise it.

178
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,659
Wouldn't that be more trouble?

179
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,899
Miss He is busy restoring Fragrance Garden. Da Fu told me.

180
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:20,939
When the divorce document is written, just send it to Fragrance Garden.

181
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,064
There's no need to meet again.

182
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,608
Young Master.

183
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,520
The water bandits caught this quickly?

184
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,079
When I got there, someone else beat me to it, so I loosened my grip.

185
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,480
The water bandits are now in the backyard.

186
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,159
Since we captured you, we aren't so easily fooled.

187
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,580
If you don't speak up, watch out for my fists!

188
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,440
You must know the crime you've committed won't escape the death penalty.

189
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,100
That's why you think speaking up is futile.

190
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,079
But what if I tell you that there's a way out?

191
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,280
If you're willing to testify and identify the mastermind,

192
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,340
I can appeal on your behalf to reduce your sentence.

193
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:24,659
Let me, the Floral Envoy, handle the interrogation of prisoners.

194
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,639
Chuan Yu will ensure their honest cooperation.

195
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,559
Thank you for your kindness, Master Jiang.

196
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,639
But I'd prefer to investigate these matters myself.

197
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,728
You've already helped me a lot.

198
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,800
I can no longer trouble you.

199
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,079
- Da Fu.
 - Let's go.

200
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,140
- Let's go.
 - Move.

201
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,000
I didn't expect you to catch the water bandits before me.

202
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,359
How could the County Princess, who's always indoors, know about prohibited oil?

203
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,499
There's only one way she could've obtained it.

204
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,324
Prince Ning.

205
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,580
You're here for Prince Ning.

206
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:38,699
Prince Ning's private possession of military goods is a grave matter.

207
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:42,780
Those investigating may easily implicate themselves with the slightest mistake.

208
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,939
Hand them over to me.

209
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,939
I can hand them over to you.

210
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,760
But Li You Zhen was willing to ruin all of Fragrance Garden just to kill me.

211
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
She injured so many innocent people.

212
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,419
Now, the most severely injured floriculturist still can't get out of bed.

213
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,919
Everyone's hard work was destroyed overnight.

214
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,860
I must give everyone an explanation.

215
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Even if someone intimidating is behind it,

216
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:16,499
do you still want to get revenge?

217
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:20,419
Yes, I already have the witnesses.

218
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,484
As for the physical evidence,

219
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:26,240
I think you've already found where the remaining oil is hidden.

220
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:33,520
Do you think finding the oil will make the County Princess surrender to the law?

221
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,200
As long as Prince Ning is powerful, she'll remain unharmed.

222
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,079
She's royalty, and I'm a merchant.

223
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,480
So I've been compromising all along.

224
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,780
But this time, she not only burned my garden, but everyone's home.

225
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,840
Whether it's presenting evidence and filing a complaint, or setting a trap for her to yield,

226
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,319
I must make her pay for her actions.

227
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,760
Even if everything is destroyed, I'll have no regrets.

228
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,620
I knew that would be your choice.

229
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,159
So you're not here to stop me.

230
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,440
You want to punish Li You Zhen,

231
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,540
and I want to get rid of Prince Ning's fire oil.

232
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:40,839
Actually, we share the same goal.

233
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,939
In that the case, let's cooperate again like we did in the millet case.

234
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,759
 Prince Ning's private warehouse is located in the city's east side.

235
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,720
 It stores all kinds of rare treasures and secretive items.

236
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,000
 Privately made weapons and the fire oil are also hidden here.

237
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,839
 The private warehouse is heavily guarded.

238
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,440
 No matter how agile you are, it's difficult to sneak in.

239
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,000
 However, I've already planted people among the servants delivering military equipment.

240
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,100
 Right now, they can be used.

241
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,660
Yes, Sir.

242
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,356
Up.

243
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,376
Slow down, slow down.

244
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,200
Wait a minute.

245
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,419
Warehouse Head.

246
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:55,219
- All of this has been checked?
 - Yes.

247
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,739
This batch of weapons is even better in quality than the last batch.

248
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,316
Yes.

249
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,636
Not bad.

250
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,344
Warehouse Head, these are specially made weapons, very precious.

251
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:36,319
Be careful not to damage them.

252
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,540
This crossbow, though light, can penetrate copper and pierce iron.

253
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,159
Indeed, it's a good weapon.

254
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
I wonder when I'll be able to use it.

255
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,480
Let them pass!

256
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,280
Prince Ning is truly bold.

257
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,159
He put these weapons in a warehouse,

258
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,659
and isn't afraid of being discovered.

259
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,580
Who dares inspect his private warehouse?

260
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,520
Hiding in plain sight is actually the safest.

261
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:59,019
- Wait a minute.
 - What's wrong?

262
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:01,959
- I've lost my bracelet.
 - This place is dangerous, and the room is dim.

263
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,024
If the lost item won't reveal your identity, don't look for it anymore.

264
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:07,200
- You might hurt your hand.
 - No, it is a woman's item.

265
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,860
If it's discovered, it may raise suspicions.

266
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,100
Thank you.

267
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,980
During the guard changeover, we have the time of three incense sticks.

268
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,620
The private warehouse has over a hundred rooms, so we need to act separately.

269
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,419
That is the windward opening.

270
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,839
Fire oil is flammable, so it can't be stored there.

271
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,459
This is the only place with water tanks.

272
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,804
Let's go.

273
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,839
You're afraid of fire. Let me do it.

274
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,300
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

275
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,179
I thought you weren't afraid of fire anymore.

276
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,879
She burned your wife's garden,

277
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,240
so you burned her father's private warehouse.

278
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,120
Your two temperaments of not wanting to suffer losses

279
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,679
is truly a match made in heaven.

280
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:59,399
I did all this for you.

281
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,919
Prince Ning is hoarding oil and making secret weapons.

282
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,660
If I don't burn it down with fire,

283
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,720
tomorrow, the fire could burn down your Daming Palace.

284
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,728
They're here.

285
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,924
Your Majesty.

286
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,900
Your Majesty. Floral Envoy.

287
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,280
Your Majesty, there was an uproar in the court today.

288
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,240
Last night, Prince Ning's private warehouse caught fire and burned all night.

289
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,600
The fire wasn't extinguished until dawn.

290
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,660
The citizens are frightened.

291
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,619
They all gathered at the Jingzhao Prefecture to demand an explanation.

292
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,319
The Ministry of Revenue also sent people to inquire.

293
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:46,516
His private warehouse is tall and imposing.

294
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:49,700
As a separate household, how could it reach people's homes?

295
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,800
Your Majesty, although it hasn't harmed people,

296
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
there have been fires in two places within a month.

297
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,839
The people are concerned that the city's fire prevention is inadequate,

298
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,080
fearing that their own homes might catch fire one day.

299
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,099
The people are worrying unnecessarily, but why is the Ministry of Revenue involved?

300
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:11,860
They're so eager to work. Perhaps I've given them too much salary.

301
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,640
Jingzhao's Offical Ren handle it himself.

302
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,720
Your Majesty, this matter also involves... the Floral Envoy's wife.

303
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,439
She also went to the Jingzhao Prefecture,

304
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,760
saying that the last fire was in her garden.

305
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,160
Moreover, Consort Shu has also sent someone to deliver a message.

306
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,200
She said the sleep-inducing sachets ordered from Fragrance Garden were all burned.

307
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,260
She ordered Official Ren to thoroughly investigate the culprit.

308
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,399
- Ling Ge also inquired about it?
 - Yes.

309
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,059
Your Majesty, it's not a big deal that something happened in my garden,

310
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:56,680
but the consecutive burning of a minister's house, and the royal private warehouse,

311
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,399
and the destruction of Consort Shu's things,

312
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,220
it seems too coincidental.

313
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,280
Could it be that someone is dissatisfied with the royal family?

314
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,860
If it isn't properly investigated,

315
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,200
next time, we won't know where the fire will reach.

316
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,180
All the way to me?

317
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,519
- Bring them here. I'll personally investigate!
 - Yes.

318
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,359
Your Majesty, the Marshal went immediately.

319
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,080
But some of the goods in the storehouse were special, and the fire was slow to extinguish,

320
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,800
which caused such public outcry.

321
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,080
What goods can burn for an entire night?

322
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,359
Is this an excuse for your dereliction of duty?

323
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,439
I haven't even punished you yet, and you're already making excuses!

324
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:48,100
Your Majesty,

325
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,240
Official Ren isn't lying.

326
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,460
This fire didn't go out because it was burning black fire oil.

327
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,519
Why do you have such forbidden items in your warehouse?

328
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,959
My subordinate was on a mission,

329
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:15,160
unexpectedly discovered a foreign merchant illegally selling it and confiscated it.

330
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,019
I thought of temporarily storing it and reporting it to the Ministry of Revenue,

331
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,959
but unexpectedly, a fire broke out.

332
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,319
Is that so?

333
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:30,220
Fortunately, you discovered it in time. Otherwise, it would've caused a big disaster.

334
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,979
- Rise.
 - Thank you, Your Majesty.

335
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:43,260
Has all the black fire oil burned out now?

336
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,200
It hasn't.

337
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,280
I led the guards in a timely rescue and ultimately saved fifty barrels.

338
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Such dangerous items should quickly be stored in the inner treasury.

339
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,859
- Don't make my brother go through the trouble of delivering it again.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

340
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:05,439
Are you sure that all the fire oil was in the treasury and has never flowed out?

341
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:09,839
If it falls into the wrong hands, I'm afraid…

342
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,979
Right, right, Imperial Brother.

343
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:17,800
I can't help but worry if there's still such a fierce thing hidden in the city.

344
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,479
How can I sleep peacefully?

345
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,280
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

346
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,720
My private warehouse is tightly guarded, and no outsiders can enter.

347
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,999
The imperial city, Your Majesty, and the people can all sleep peacefully.

348
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:41,219
If that's the case, why was my wife's garden drenched with this black fire oil?

349
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,160
I don't think you've seen this oil before.

350
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,820
How can you determine that Fragrance Garden was burned by this oil?

351
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:00,240
I didn't believe it before either.

352
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,519
But the smell of fire oil on Official Ren's body

353
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,159
is exactly the same as what I smelled in Fragrance Garden that day.

354
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,499
Was the burning of your garden not an accident, but a man-made disaster?

355
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:15,120
But how is it connected with my brother's fire oil?

356
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,359
What exactly is going on here?

357
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,160
Your Majesty, someone sent a gift to the garden in my name.

358
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,740
But there was fire oil hidden in the boxes, and burned the garden down as a result.

359
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,720
Mu Dan is heartbroken and cries to me all day long.

360
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,380
She doesn't even have the heart to run the shops anymore.

361
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:39,039
She's my beloved, and also my cash cow.

362
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,939
If this continues, won't I be losing money every day?

363
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,879
Official Ren hasn't found the arsonist yet, so I had no choice but to investigate it myself.

364
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,776
I caught a few arsonist water bandits.

365
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:55,280
They confessed with their own mouths the use of black fire oil.

366
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,039
My private warehouse is guarded in three shifts day and night.

367
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:11,640
How could mere water bandits possibly sneak in and steal things?

368
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,760
Moreover, no one has reported any thefts previously.

369
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,039
It must be those water bandits spouting nonsense.

370
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,720
They said this fire oil was rare and hard to come by.

371
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,039
They secretly hid a jar before committing arson.

372
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,780
Let's bring them up in a moment. Compare the two oils, and it'll become clear.
