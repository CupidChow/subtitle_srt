The tea is for you.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can drink it.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Bai Wei is a global partner of the official cooperation.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He will take you to the heaven.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you are here now.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How can I leave you alone?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't interfere with your business.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I can help you to find the delivery man.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The enemy is trying to frame me.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will definitely prepare everything.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How can I let you find out the mistake?

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have my own way to solve this problem.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will go out.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You stay in Jiang's mansion.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't show yourself.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Be careful with Liu Chang and the county magistrate.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's Ning Wang again.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't worry.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will take care of myself.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But Ning Wang has always been good to you.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it because of me again?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I came here for you.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's none of your business.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't worry.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
These traps won't kill me.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They just want to trap me here.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They want to test me.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Put the flowers here.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't move them.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They look good.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not afraid of people.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Liu Chang can do whatever he wants.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm happy here for two days.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not afraid of people.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm happy here for two days.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm happy here for two days.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't worry about me.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I saw this man in Jiang's mansion.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He took Du Zhi Langzhen to the river.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
They are going west.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, no.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's Wan Guan Tang.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They are going to check Jiang Cheng Yang's private account.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You go tell Yun Yang.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll go to detain Liu Chang.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This way.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Move.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Move.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Move.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He Weifeng?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
General.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Are you hurt?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I fell down.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm afraid I can't walk.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know if you can take me back to the station.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is not the way to the Qin Shu village.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You learned to be nice to my brother for Jiang Cheng Yang.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You know that I'm not a good person.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know that I'm not a good person.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You know that I'm not a good person.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You already know.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why would you let me get in the car?

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's rare that you took the initiative to find me.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No matter what the reason is,

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm willing to stay with you.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Then can you tell me

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
where are you taking me now?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's windy and heavy.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm just taking you home.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Zhu Fu?

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I've already been sent to pick you up.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll be your companion.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Listen up.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Go.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother, look.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We have a deal.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If there's an accident or you find out

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that the King of Ning is acting strange,

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you can leave the city

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and go to the city at any time.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
My men will see you.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay. You're the best at this.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll listen to you.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The light of the palace is different.

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It can lead to different industries.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You just need to hang it

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and copy the painting.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The person who sends the message

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
will handle it.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This side is the garden.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This side is the temple.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is the garden.

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the flower.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Liu Jun,

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you've searched the house

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and checked the accounts.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's wrong?

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mister,

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the man appeared at the dock again.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He left the inn

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and came to the temple.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's been transferred to another inn.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He really learned to light things?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He got his lightings.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's a master who came from outside.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mister, I don't believe that the man

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is connected to Jiang Cheng Yong.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It doesn't matter whether I believe it or not.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not a genius.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I need to get the evidence

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
before I trap Jiang Cheng Yong.

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Open the door!

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Open the door!

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Open the door!

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Open the door!

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Open the door!

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Open the door!

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Open the door!

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Open the door!

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Open the door!

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Oy!

150
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Why does the Boss cakes?

151
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,980
What are you doing,

152
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Miss?

153
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
What did you hide?

154
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,980
You care so much about me.

155
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,980
I must kill you today.

156
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
It's because the Jiang's family is so innocent

157
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
that I can't let a villain like you

158
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
to humiliate me.

159
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Stop!

160
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Sun Nanyu stabbed me.

161
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,980
The sharpness of the sword is like a saint's hand.

162
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
I'll see who dares to do it!

163
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Don't be so stubborn

164
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,980
and be careful not to get hurt.

165
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
I can't save you either.

166
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
Hou Weifeng!

167
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
If you dare to come any closer,

168
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,980
I'll make you pay with blood!

169
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:43,140
A

170
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,860
Okay, we have to go.

171
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,100
If they find us, then we will immediately go.

172
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,700
They will look for us.

173
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,280
Do you understand, Xiaodong?

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
We will look for her.

175
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,980
She shall look for her, and what if there is risk?

176
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,280
Is this what we should do?

177
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
If you don't talk, our son will be fine.

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
After all, she is the daughter of the governor.

179
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
She has already asked the princess to plead.

180
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
What crime can't be cleared?

181
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Young Mistress.

182
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Mother!

183
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's go back.

184
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Go back?

185
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Yes, yes, yes.

186
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Your husband didn't even come to the mansion.

187
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
How can you be so heartless?

188
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
And?

189
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
I always ran away from home.

190
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
A law Developer chocolate!

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Oh, wait.

192
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
So signed on February 26th.

193
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Wei Yuan!

194
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
Wait!

195
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I have not yet gotten used to withdrawal concrete.

196
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Not even in the problem of買 Кубы.

197
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
What are you doing?

198
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Cloud foundation came back.

199
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The witness of the crime is either killed or killed.

200
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
The Court of Justice cannot investigate it.

201
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Moreover, the case of the real murder of the concubine is not the first.

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,280
There are many such cases.

203
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
The King of Nihuang cannot find any evidence.

204
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
It's not easy to stop the Queen from pleading.

205
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
It's all thanks to Xue Xi.

206
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
You should thank her.

207
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,280
How can I thank you for your help?

208
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm not good enough compared to Xue Xi.

209
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,280
The owner of the He Palace is not a person who is self-righteous.

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm not self-righteous.

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I just feel a little powerless.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
You once said that I'm a cunning fox.

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,280
I can overcome any difficulties.

214
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,280
But a fox can only solve the case of the case.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,280
The doubt in the water is hurt.

216
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Even if I want to save it, I can't do it.

217
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm tired.

218
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I need to recharge.

219
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
But Xue Xi is different.

220
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
She is like you.

221
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,280
She can take care of you and help you.

222
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,280
You are living in the same lake.

223
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Mudan,

224
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,280
you can't decide your mood and feelings.

225
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You can't decide your mood and feelings.

226
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
How do you know I'm not another fox?

227
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
I accidentally fell into the water.

228
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Maybe I really need my companion to help me.

229
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,280
You've been working hard for me these days.

230
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
You've been running for me and sending a letter to Yun Niang.

231
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Liu Chang saw the fake account book I wanted him to see.

232
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
In order to stop Liu Chang from searching,

233
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,280
he used a jade sword like a general to hold his neck.

234
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,280
He forced his men to pull out their swords and swords.

235
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,280
They are all the helpers who helped me.

236
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,280
You have a thousand eyes.

237
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,280
You know so much about me.

238
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
I know.

239
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
So even if you don't tell me,

240
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
I know.

241
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,280
You don't care about your relationship.

242
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
You risked so much for me.

243
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Thank you.

244
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,280
You said we don't need to act.

245
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
You've already packed dinner, right?

246
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Hurry up.

247
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm going to the bathroom.

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Liu Chang only found out that the camera man is a gang of bandits.

249
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,280
He entered and left the temple to smuggle.

250
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Prince Ning failed to succeed.

251
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,280
He even asked us to eliminate the spy who was behind the princess.

252
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Wang Ri was very smart.

253
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,280
This time he used his left hand on Ling Ge.

254
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
If there is no Mudan,

255
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I will not be able to find the real murderer.

256
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
If there is no Mudan,

257
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Ling Ge will...

258
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm afraid he can't do it because of the crown prince.

259
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
For the safety of Ling Ge and Wang,

260
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,280
don't mention it for now.

261
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,280
The inner palace is not far away.

262
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
His Majesty can take this matter.

263
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
He will investigate the palace people.

264
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
I have a lot of evidence.

265
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I will not write it again.

266
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Although Prince Ning has not found anything,

267
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
he is suspicious.

268
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm afraid he can't solve it.

269
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
If Prince Ning is suspicious,

270
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
he will not be so easy.

271
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I have received a message from Prince Ning last night.

272
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
He said that his son-in-law is not sensible.

273
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
He was surprised by the people in my house.

274
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
He also said that Prince Ning was going to the palace that day.

275
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
He was robbed by someone else.

276
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
What a clever man!

277
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Luckily, Xue Xi invited the princess to the palace.

278
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I let you go.

279
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Otherwise, he would have sold you out.

280
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I don't know how you will pay me back.

281
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Liu Chang proposed to me

282
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,280
to solve the case.

283
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Since Prince Ning is suspicious,

284
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
he will not only do it to me.

285
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
If Liu Chang does not find any evidence,

286
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
he will not let it go.

287
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Prince Ning will only suspect him of me because of Mudan.

288
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Moreover,

289
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I just helped him to become the minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

290
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
It is a good thing.

291
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
It is more practical than Liu Chang's tricks.

292
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
How is the transport?

293
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Before General Yu came,

294
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,280
the Ministry of Revenue had to clean up the place completely.

295
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
The government has found out about Prince Ning's stolen items.

296
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Now we are looking for where these things were transported.

297
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
What is so mysterious?

298
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:25,160
The

299
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Consort of Shu has returned to the palace.

300
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
After this incident,

301
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
we must strengthen the guard.

302
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
It will be difficult to do it again.

303
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I am afraid that the Flower Bird Envoy

304
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280
will be suspicious of me.

305
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Liu Zishu,

306
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
you are really my good son-in-law.

307
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Your Majesty,

308
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
the Jiang's house has not been searched.

309
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
There is no conclusion

310
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
whether Jiang Changyang is suspicious.

311
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
What do you think?

312
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Your Majesty,

313
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
the military secretaries of the Pingkang's

314
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
are all the same.

315
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
The Flower Bird Envoy

316
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
has been in the city for a long time.

317
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,280
He has been to the official banquet of the Jiang's house.

318
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Have you seen the life of the Jiang's house?

319
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I don't believe that

320
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
a greedy and greedy person like him

321
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
would be so heartless.

322
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I am very interested in fighting these days.

323
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I found that

324
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
all the goods and goods

325
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
were searched by Jiang Changyang.

326
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
The saint chose several people to go to Yangji.

327
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
They have been like this

328
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
for a long time.

329
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Have they been pretending

330
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
all these years?

331
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
It is because of the many years

332
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
that we should find out

333
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
whether Jiang Changyang is suspicious.

334
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
If Jiang Changyang is really ambitious,

335
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
why not choose a person

336
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
who can help his own daughter?

337
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
It is not more important

338
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
to do something.

339
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
With the current situation,

340
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I am afraid that Xue Xi

341
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
has already lost Jiang Changyang.

342
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Hurry up.

343
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
You must take down Xiao's family.

344
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Yes.

345
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Your Majesty, are you sure?

346
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
How come Jiang Changyang was released

347
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
before I searched the house?

348
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
How could a shaman

349
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
block the way

350
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
of the court

351
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
outside the house of the Jiang's?

352
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Do you really think

353
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
that the shaman

354
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
is a shaman?

355
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I am sure that

356
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
the shaman is a shaman.

357
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Do you really think

358
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
that I do not know your mind?

359
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I have no feelings

360
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
for the king or the shaman.

361
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
If there is a lie,

362
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
I will punish you.

363
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Jiang Changyang

364
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
is a smart man.

365
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
He can please the people,

366
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,280
and help me

367
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
when I need it.

368
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
But because he is a smart man,

369
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
if he is my enemy,

370
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I will not be able to find out the truth.

371
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
I will let you investigate.

372
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
But you

373
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
will return empty-handed.

374
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I will go to the palace to comfort him.

375
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

376
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I am not capable enough.

377
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I will not

378
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
act rashly next time.

379
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
You should cherish your food.

380
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Use the money I gave you.

381
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Wake up.

382
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Do your job well.

383
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Do not get hurt again.

384
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
You are useless.

385
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I feel sorry for you.

386
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I understand.

387
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
I will not disappoint you.

388
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
This is the goose

389
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
that the princess gave to me.

390
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Take it.

391
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
It is the best soup for you.

392
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Xue Xin is too kind.

393
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
You are my husband's old friend.

394
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
You helped him to leave the Dali Temple.

395
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
We should thank you.

396
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
You should not do this.

397
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
I am helping you

398
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
because of the princess.

399
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I hope you will not mind.

400
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Of course not.

401
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
You are my savior.

402
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
If I was not too small,

403
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
I would have asked you to live with me.

404
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Xue Xin,

405
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
if you are not used to it,

406
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
tell Jiang Changyang

407
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
that I have everything you need.

408
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Mudan is like a legend.

409
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
It is different from other women.

410
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
These are the new powder.

411
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Xue Xin, look.

412
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Take it away.

413
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
We have the soup.

414
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
We have the soup.

415
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Try it.

416
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
It smells good.

417
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
What is this?

418
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
This is the medicine for the conch.

419
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
The flower is full of conch.

420
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
It is the green plant.

421
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
It is sold in the village.

422
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
We have the medicine for burns and burns.

423
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
The one you are holding

424
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,280
is the scar left by the conch.

425
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
The scar is about half a month old.

426
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
It can be removed.

427
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
So strong.

428
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Can you remove the scar

429
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
from the old scar

430
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
for more than ten years?

431
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
More than ten years?

432
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,280
We have not tried it.

433
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
The scar is the best

434
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
when it is just left.

435
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
The scar is the best when it is just left.

436
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
The scar is the best when it is just left.

437
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Xue Xin, do you have the scar?

438
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Do you have the scar?

439
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
You can try it.

440
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
If you can't,

441
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
I will ask Xiaochun to come and see it.

442
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
But you have reminded me.

443
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
We can make another medicine

444
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
to remove the scar.

445
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Did your father tell you

446
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
about the conch?

447
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Father knew Pei Zhong's identity.

448
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
He wanted to push the marriage.

449
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
But he was afraid

450
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
that Prince Ning would offend him.

451
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
Prince Ning wanted to be friends with the Xiao family.

452
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Even if there was no Pei Zhong,

453
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
there would be someone else.

454
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Father often said

455
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
that the court is a cloud of clouds.

456
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
If you can get along with each other,

457
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
it is best to be alone.

458
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
If not,

459
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
you should have less fights.

460
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
It is difficult to do.

461
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
You need to think about it.

462
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Fine.

463
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
You live with me.

464
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
I can stop Pei Zhong from harassing you.

465
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You were close to Prince Ning.

466
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
Why did he send someone

467
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
to investigate your private property?

468
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
How did you offend him?

469
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
You should have heard.

470
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Mudan was Liu Chang's wife.

471
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Since I took her,

472
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Liu Chang has been targeting

473
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
and provoking me and Prince Ning.

474
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I am sorry.

475
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
I didn't mean to offend you.

476
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I was just trying to help you.

477
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
With respect to Liu Chang,

478
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Jimmy at one morgue

479
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
was about to share

480
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
extra money with a woman.

481
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
At first he said

482
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,280
the money would be enough to

483
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
arrange some contributions

484
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
to his wife's private property.

485
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Thoseigning letter

486
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
called her father.

487
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
The letter reminded him

488
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
of a flower Please do help my mother.

489
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,280
My mother was the one who applied the medicine and comforted you.

490
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Why did you mention this?

491
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
My wife said that the scar was hidden under the coat.

492
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
No one could see it except the family.

493
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I was crying.

494
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,280
But I didn't know you had such a scar.

495
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
You two were married.

496
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
I was afraid that you would be in danger.

497
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,280
I was so worried that you would see it.

498
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Why did you do this?

499
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
Mudan Mountain was in danger.

500
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
I had no choice but to save her life.

501
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,280
Now that I have a wife, I can avoid the inevitable.

502
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
It's not easy.

503
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
I see.

504
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Please keep your mouth shut.

505
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Don't worry.

506
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
No one will know.

507
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
In the fifth year of the Duanwu family,

508
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,280
the family of flowers lived in the square of the special building.

509
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
All the goods were sold out.

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Fifty items were sold out every day.

511
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Get in line.

512
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Before closing the garden, the flowers will collect the remaining goods

513
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
and put them in a mysterious bag.

514
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Don't miss it.

515
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,280
The flowers will record the cost of the guests.

516
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

517
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
the first-time buyers of flowers

518
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,280
can choose the best flowers of the winter.

519
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Please buy them.

520
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Okay.

521
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,280
The flowers of the winter are all different.

522
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
What's the difference between the fresh flowers and the fresh ones?

523
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
You don't know.

524
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
When we rebuilt the square,

525
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,280
we put up a row of tiles and put them in the warm room.

526
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
We used them to cultivate the rare mudan.

527
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
We've been studying this for a long time.

528
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,280
We've also cultivated the flowers of the mudan that can bloom in the winter.

529
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
How can there be such a rare flower?

530
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Please help me check if my flowers are in the right time.

531
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Okay.

532
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
We've picked a lot of them today.

533
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Okay.

534
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,280
The ladies need to spend a lot of money on makeup every day.

535
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,280
The men should be able to do it.

536
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
This one. I want this one.

537
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
And that one.

538
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
How is the fragrance? Do you like it?

539
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Yes.

540
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Please try it.

541
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Look at the flowers. They are so beautiful.

542
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Please come again.

543
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Okay.

544
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,280
The owner of the shop, three boxes of soy milk, three boxes of fragrance, two hundred dollars.

545
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Liu Cheng, run.

546
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
This is the best.

547
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
This is our new product.

548
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Is He Weifang here?

549
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
No.

550
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Please go back.

551
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
It doesn't matter.

552
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm here to take care of the business.

553
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Please go back.

554
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
My lady, please do it tomorrow.

555
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
You might hurt your eyes.

556
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
My lady.

557
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Today, my husband bought a lot of perfumes.

558
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
The ladies need them.

559
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Okay.

560
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
The owner of the shop.

561
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
It's He Weifang again.

562
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
The owner of the shop.

563
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
The woman on your left.

564
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
It's the same woman.

565
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
As if she was my wife.

566
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
She would do her work for living

567
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
if she had a husband.

568
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Make my partner clean for me.

569
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I'll make this woman queen.

570
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Accept for her.

571
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Did you lit this pendant or not?

572
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
No.

573
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Everyone in the mansion will want to play with me

574
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
You are not even trying to get pregnant

575
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
How dare you to care about your reputation?

576
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
You can't go! I said you can't go!

577
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
You can't go!

578
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
You bitch!

579
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Pingzhi, how are you?

580
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
How are you?

581
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I'll help you to scare them

582
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm going to kill you

583
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Go!

584
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
What's the matter?

585
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
The sky is dry

586
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
and the dawn is coming

587
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
The fire is burning

588
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
and nothing will remain

589
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Here, Xiaochun

590
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Thank you, uncle

591
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Thank you

592
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Everyone

593
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
The festival is over

594
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
and the business is booming

595
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Everyone, tonight

596
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
we'll drink to our heart's content

597
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
and have a good rest

598
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I'll drink to you

599
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Thank you, uncle

600
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Come

601
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Uncle

602
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Uncle, the prize is here

603
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Come, come, come

604
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Put it on the table

605
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
So much

606
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
It's so delicious

607
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Madam, the man

608
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
is sorry for your hard work

609
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
He went to the rich house

610
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
and picked the best wine

611
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Please enjoy

612
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Madam, there are many more

613
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I'll leave now

614
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
Thank you

615
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Thank you

616
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
It's so good

617
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
It's so good

618
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
It's so good

619
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Come and try it

620
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
It's so good

621
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
It's so good

622
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Madam, you're so polite

623
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
It's so hard to have such a good husband

624
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
You should go back to your home

625
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
You're right

626
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I promised you to live with you

627
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
I'm still young

628
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Madam, you've been in the garden

629
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
and you miss your wife

630
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Go back

631
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
I'll visit the peony

632
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
in the warm room

633
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Father has come

634
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
The peony is so good

635
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
It's not bad

636
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Chuan, come

637
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Why so many food?

638
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
It's from Jiang Jun

639
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
Liulang, go and eat

640
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay

641
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Come, come, come

642
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Peony, you don't go

643
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Xin Yi will give it to you

644
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
I have an appointment with Chuan Yu

645
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
and I'll be back in a minute

646
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
What do you want to say to him?

647
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
I'll tell him

648
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Come, come, come

649
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Drink, drink

650
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Okay

651
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Come, come, eat

652
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Eat

653
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
The four kings are like the grass

654
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
One is a drop of milk

655
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
The owner of the house

656
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
reminds me of myself

657
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
He sent me a snack

658
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
This is a gift for Jiang Jun

659
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
He asked the people of the garden

660
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
to eat the food of the rich

661
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
This is the gift

662
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
for the rich

663
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
from the peony

664
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
He also wrote a poem

665
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
The four kings are like the grass

666
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
What?

667
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
What?

668
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Why are you lying?

669
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Why are you lying?

670
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
When did I invite his people

671
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
to eat food from the peony?

672
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Well, Jiang Jun sent the peonies

673
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
to give them food

674
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Everyone has a share

675
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
of ten boxes

676
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I didn't do anything

677
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Have you seen the peonies

678
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
in the present?

679
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Did you check the things in the boxes?

680
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
They are all food

681
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I and Peony only saw two boxes

682
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
The rest were sent to the guest house

683
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,280
What? You didn't send it?

684
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
No.

685
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Let's go.

686
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,640
Starking

687
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
They send me to send to spy felt in secret.

688
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Even if you know I didn't see the peon,

689
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
you still want to kill him.

690
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
You're really a fool.

691
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I was so worried before.

692
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
I didn't even have time to change my uniform to save people.

693
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Why didn't I go in?

694
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
God's good plan

695
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
made me a hero.

696
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I shouldn't have waited for this fire to burn more.

697
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Fire!

698
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Fire!

699
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Stop!

700
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Don't go.

701
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I've had enough of this life.

702
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Only when he dies, you'll look back at me.

703
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
You asked for this life.

704
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
If you don't set this fire,

705
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
I won't come here.

706
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
You're my husband.

707
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I won't let you in.

708
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
You can't go in there.

709
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
I can't let you in.

710
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
You're here just in time.

711
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Look at him with me.

712
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
He's burning in the fire.

713
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
He's burning to ashes.

714
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
You'll give up on him.

715
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
You'll be with me forever.

716
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Fire!

717
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Hurry!

718
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Master!

719
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Get out!

720
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Master, get out!

721
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Master, get out!

722
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Master, get out!

723
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Fire!

724
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Fire!

725
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
Fire!

726
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
THE END
