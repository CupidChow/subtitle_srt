00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,940
On the horse.

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,800
Yes!

19
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,360
Excuse me! Excuse me!

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Well done!

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Commander Pei looks down on me too much.

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
He is in the palace with the lady and the princess.

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Why would he come for me?

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,640
To be honest, in his eyes, I'm just a lowly concubine who earns money for him.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
After death, the property will be returned to the family.

26
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,640
He can cry for me for a day, it's a great love.

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
You are wrong.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,640
I'm afraid that you won't find out that I didn't come back to the house tomorrow after you wake up.

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,640
You poured me wine and tied my hands. How can I drink?

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Instead of crying with me until tomorrow, why don't you tie me up first?

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
I'll accompany you to enjoy the wine.

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,640
It seems that I was right.

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:56,640
If Jiang Changyang died in front of you, I wonder how long he would cry.

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Jiang Changyang!

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Don't move!

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Put down the knife and let your people out.

38
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Hurry!

39
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I know that you love your wife so much.

40
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,640
But you should understand that if you are loved by others, you will feel so painful.

41
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Xuexi and I are just brothers.

42
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
She didn't see you.

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,640
It's just that the last time she saw you, she was so angry that she couldn't calm down.

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
She couldn't fulfill the king's orders, so she put the anger on me.

45
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It's not right.

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
You're right!

47
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
She was the one who went out with him on the first day of the wedding.

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,640
She was beautiful and beautiful, but she couldn't bear to part with her beloved.

49
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
She was so romantic, but she couldn't be Xuexi.

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
But I'm different!

51
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
You're so heartless!

52
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,640
If it wasn't for me, Xuexi wouldn't marry you.

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,640
She did it for the sake of the Xiao family, for the sake of protecting the king's reputation.

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Why didn't she see the old hand?

55
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
She didn't see the old hand.

56
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
But if it was for the Xiao family, it would be a disaster for the

57
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Wei family.

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Even if she couldn't fulfill the king's orders, she would have many chances to serve the king.

59
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
But if it was for the Xiao family, it would be a disaster for the Wei family.

60
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Aren't you afraid of making a scene?

61
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm not trying to be your enemy.

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,640
It's just that I have no other choice.

63
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
If you really want to share the king's worries,

64
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,640
you should help me persuade Xuexi.

65
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Xuexi seems to be weak, but she is very determined.

66
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
She thinks it's hard to turn back.

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I can't control her.

68
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
How can I stop her?

69
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
She's not a woman.

70
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
It's hard to turn back.

71
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I can't control her.

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Forget it.

73
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Thank you for your advice.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I was wrong today.

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
You took her away.

76
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,640
Xuexi?

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Shanghai.

78
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Go!

79
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:37,740
Feel afraid with

80
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,460
Disappeared

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Your

82
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,620
Give the orderly the wrong side back.

83
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
Give the orderly the right side!

84
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,360
Get serious!

85
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
Someone like you who is in the dark

86
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
would die for you.

87
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,440
What a joke!

88
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,560
Open the chamber.

89
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
Or I'll kill you now.

90
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm a member of King Ning.

91
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
How dare you kill me?

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
Come on.

93
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,720
Come on!

94
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,520
Jiang Cheng Yang!

95
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
This is a sword from the Yut.

96
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
How dare you!

97
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
Open it!

98
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
Shake hands.

99
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Where is the antidote?

100
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,360
To do this without the antidote,

101
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
dead or alive,

102
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,200
if you're dead,

103
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,920
Even if there's a antidote,

104
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Zhiban can't live.

105
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,560
If he dies,

106
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
you'll die with him.

107
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,560
The antidote!

108
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Go get the antidote.

109
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,920
Yes.

110
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,600
Jiang Changyang,

111
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
you're a master of the sword.

112
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
You're a master of the sword.

113
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Do you think those noble ladies

114
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,760
will marry you?

115
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,040
Only a lowly merchant

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
would want to die with you.

117
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,440
I won't kill you

118
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,440
because her safety is more important than yours.

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
If you dare to touch me again,

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,040
I'll kill you.

121
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,200
A true lover gets life.

122
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,080
Who can tube- 201

123
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,680
than me?

124
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Every slave must have herierungs,

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,120
eaten to the bone and

126
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
almotic virtual body behind.

127
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:20,640
The Chinese are destined to be separated from their family and friends for the rest of their lives.

128
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Shut up!

129
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Attention!

130
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Attention!

131
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Attention!

132
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Attention!

133
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
How is it?

134
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
This poison will leave a mark. When will he wake up?

135
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,640
According to the order of the V-Mobile, he can completely remove the poison within three days and he will be fine.

136
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
He will wake up in an hour.

137
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
But he is forced to prepare some soft porridge.

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Chanyu.

139
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I was the one who did not do the right thing.

140
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
That's why I dragged Mudan here.

141
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Pei Zhong came for me.

142
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
I caused him to die.

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Sixth Brother!

144
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Since you can't protect her, why didn't you let her go?

145
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,640
I was following you, so I was in danger.

146
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Sixth Brother.

147
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
It's all my fault. Don't blame her.

148
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,640
You risked your life for your own marriage.

149
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
What did you do wrong? Why did you suffer such a terrible loss?

150
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Sixth Brother, Mudan is fine now. Calm down.

151
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,640
She is fine now. What about next time?

152
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
I only have one sister.

153
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I don't want to lose her too.

154
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:15,640
You are destined to be separated from your family for the rest of your life.

155
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Mudan, you are awake.

156
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Doctor.

157
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Sister.

158
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I am here.

159
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Where is Mudan?

160
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
He is in the hospital.

161
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
I am here.

162
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I am here.

163
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I am here.

164
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I am here.

165
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
I am here.

166
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
I am here.

167
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I am here.

168
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I am here.

169
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Sixth Brother.

170
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Be careful.

171
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Where is Jiang Changyang?

172
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
He is dead.

173
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
What are you talking about?

174
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Don't listen to him.

175
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
He is fine.

176
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Then why is he not here?

177
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
He is not here.

178
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
He is not here.

179
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I don't want to watch this.

180
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
It's not his fault.

181
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
You are right.

182
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
If he were not here,

183
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I would be here now.

184
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
You are right.

185
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
He is not here.

186
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
I don't want to watch this.

187
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
He's not here.

188
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,960
You care about him so much.

189
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,080
Only me and Da Fu are here.

190
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,880
You're disappointed.

191
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,240
You know...

192
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,240
You know I didn't mean that.

193
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
Since the situation is critical,

194
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I feel uneasy

195
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,040
if I don't see him.

196
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,280
And you're protecting him from guards.

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
What's the danger?

198
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,840
Enough, Liu Lang.

199
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,120
Jiang Jun is fine.

200
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
He's back.

201
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
He sent Chuan Yu to eat just now.

202
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:55,820
And he sent a

203
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
He's back!

204
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,760
You're back now!

205
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,760
Pah!

206
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,680
I thought he would die so soon.

207
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:28,680
I thought he would die

208
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I don't know if he asked himself if he knew me.

209
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I only know that I can die for my soul.

210
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,760
I don't know if he knows me.

211
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Jiang Changyang.

212
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
It's late. You should rest.

213
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm here to see the funeral.

214
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,760
If the Sixth Wolf beats you, I can't afford to move overnight.

215
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Go to the Yuanjie.

216
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,760
If you're involved, you won't see the moon.

217
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Don't blame yourself. You helped me a lot before.

218
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
This time I'll repay you.

219
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I helped you because I have the ability.

220
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
What about you?

221
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,760
What do you mean?

222
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Our marriage is a disguise.

223
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,760
It's not a good thing to pretend to be a stranger.

224
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
You don't have to be so serious.

225
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,760
From now on, don't put me in danger.

226
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm not in danger.

227
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
I'm here to see you.

228
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
And you're telling me this?

229
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Jiang Changyang, what's wrong with you?

230
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm just afraid of what happened today.

231
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Mudan.

232
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I'm glad to have taught you this.

233
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,760
That day in front of Ning Wang, you helped me to hide the secret.

234
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm very grateful.

235
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,760
But today, you even gave up your life to save me.

236
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,760
This is a great honor for me.

237
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I don't even want my own life.

238
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:56,760
This is a burden for me.

239
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
A burden?

240
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Mudan.

241
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,760
You are He Weifang, the leader of the flower shop.

242
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
You are the owner of the big shop.

243
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
You don't help others.

244
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
You fight for a world of chaos with your own hands.

245
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
You should live a free life.

246
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
You shouldn't feel wronged for anything.

247
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,760
You shouldn't put yourself in danger for anyone.

248
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Yes.

249
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,760
I should be free.

250
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
You're right.

251
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I've heard what you said.

252
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
From now on, we are not in a relationship.

253
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
It's a secret.

254
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
I'm sorry.

256
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
I'm sorry.

261
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm sorry.

262
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm sorry.

266
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sorry.

267
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
I'm sorry.

269
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I'm sorry.

270
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I shouldn't have put you in danger.

271
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Who are you?

272
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Take him away.

273
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
You witch!

274
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Any possibility could get into our shop.

275
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Back ship!

276
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
You oppose

277
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
me?

278
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
You want to lure anyone?

279
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Of course, I do.

280
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I liked our market and I gave you the town.

281
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,360
After this incident, I woke up.

282
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,360
I'm used to Wan Qian's danger.

283
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,280
But how can I ask her to get used to it?

284
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,160
I shouldn't have tied her up for my own personal reasons.

285
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,720
All these...

286
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
...leave now.

287
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,720
I don't think you should.

288
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,000
Let her live in state of deformity.

289
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,080
I shouldn't have tied her up here,

290
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,400
and made her to get used to it.

291
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,400
It's lucky to have the bright moon that we all look forward to

292
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Why do we have to turn this bright moon into a lantern?

293
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
If the big banquet doesn't happen in the future

294
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,400
It's because we are forced to die together

295
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
But people think that the wife is your beloved wife

296
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,400
But if you are together, it's no different from the present situation

297
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
If this situation is not resolved

298
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
If it's a crisis

299
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I can persuade her to leave as a friend

300
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
If she knows my feelings

301
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
She will not leave me

302
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
No matter what danger she faces

303
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
She will not leave me

304
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm not afraid to die

305
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,400
But I'm afraid that she will die because of me

306
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
But I...

307
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't want to die

308
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
What about Pei Zhong?

309
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,400
I will order the banquet to be held in accordance with the old rules

310
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Sir, the weapons that King Ning hid in Chang'an are all under Pei Zhong's control

311
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
If the banquet follows this line, we can immediately find out all the weapons of King Ning

312
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
If we kill Pei Zhong now

313
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
King Ning will change his army and it will be difficult to track down

314
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
The banquet has not yet been successful

315
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Please think twice

316
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
It's okay to spare his life

317
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
But we must avenge Mudan

318
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
A gentleman can endure 10 years of revenge

319
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,400
But a flower bird can only ask for his own happiness

320
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes

321
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Zhang Changyang

322
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
You bastard

323
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Zhang Changyang

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
He is so cowardly

325
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
He not only hurt me but also spread the news about Chang'an

326
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Now the outsiders are laughing at me

327
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
He is so...

328
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
He is so ungrateful

329
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Please help me, Your Majesty

330
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Please help me, Your Majesty

331
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Duan An is not a man of his word

332
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
He didn't leave any evidence

333
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
How can you judge him with just one word?

334
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I saw it with my own eyes

335
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,400
The man who hurt me was his bodyguard

336
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Are there any other witnesses besides you?

337
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
You framed him

338
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
He hit you with two knives

339
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
It's already a disgrace to me

340
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Xuexi came here the other day

341
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Guess what he said to me

342
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
I don't know

343
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
You two are jealous of him

344
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,400
But Xuexi is defending Zhang Changyang

345
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,400
You should learn from him to win his heart

346
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Your Majesty, he is a coward

347
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
It's fine

348
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,400
If he has the guts, he can take back the city

349
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Xuexi's love is not important

350
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
The important thing is that the Xiao family is not to be disobeyed

351
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Yes

352
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Mudan! Mudan!

353
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Mudan!

354
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Mudan! Mudan!

355
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
What's wrong?

356
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
We finally got to the port

357
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
But the merchant ship in the south was stopped

358
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Why?

359
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I asked around

360
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
The people at the dock were quiet

361
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
They were talking in a hurry

362
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
They said it was the order from the superior

363
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Why did you take over my merchant ship?

364
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
What's your purpose?

365
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I was promoted to the official today

366
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
My father is gone

367
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
And today...

368
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
It's nothing

369
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
I just want to see you

370
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Drink with me and watch the sunset

371
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Your merchant ship will leave tomorrow

372
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Now my merchant ship is not only this one

373
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Please take it back

374
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
I will take it away

375
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
The shop is busy

376
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm sorry

377
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Take this

378
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
It will be a good trip

379
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm sorry

380
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
I just want you to accompany me today

381
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Just a little bit

382
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
You don't expect me to do this?

383
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm not forcing you

384
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
The superior was fired and confiscated

385
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
If you keep bothering me

386
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I will lose my life

387
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
That's because you are Jiang Changyang's man

388
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
He fought with Pei Zhong

389
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
But you were poisoned

390
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
You will not be safe with such a stubborn man

391
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
in the future

392
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I heard that a man with a broken leg

393
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
is the most difficult to deal with when he is cold

394
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
When he was transported, he burned two fire pots

395
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
It's obvious that the old wound is still hurting

396
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Don't forget

397
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm the daughter of Prince Ning

398
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Prince Ning is wise

399
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
He has the ability to tolerate people

400
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
If you can serve the king

401
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
The whole country's trade will be at your disposal

402
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I will help you

403
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I will be able to travel the whole country in three years

404
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
You forced me to come here

405
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
just for money

406
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Why are you here

407
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
and acting like a man?

408
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I'm willing to help you

409
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
That's to clear the obstacles

410
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
in the future

411
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
I don't have any doubts

412
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
about you

413
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't you like peony?

414
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
When the flower is in full bloom

415
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
we will go to the south

416
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
to live

417
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I can let you

418
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
have peony forever

419
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Liu Chang

420
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
You really

421
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
make me laugh

422
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
We used to be like swords

423
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Now you pretend to be kind to me

424
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Your various desires

425
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
are just for your own ambitions

426
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
and your own personal desires

427
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
This is not love at all

428
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
This is not love

429
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
But I know

430
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
If you marry Jiang Cheng Yang

431
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I will be like a scourge

432
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
trapped in this dirty dungeon

433
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
That's my heartache

434
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
far more painful than the pain of cutting off a foot

435
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Isn't this love?

436
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Do you know what love is?

437
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
True love is

438
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
love for what you love

439
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
pain for what you love

440
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,400
But it's not about the love

441
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
Love is a sword that can hurt people

442
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
It's a moon that can be seen

443
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
It's a long-lost love

444
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
You really

445
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
like Jiang Cheng Yang?

446
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Yes

447
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Impossible

448
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Jiang Cheng Yang is greedy for the royal law

449
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
and he is reckless

450
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Why should he wait for you to clear the obstacles?

451
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
I didn't understand what love was

452
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Jiang Cheng Yang made me understand

453
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
what love is

454
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
But you

455
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
are the opposite

456
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
You don't care about the county governor

457
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
and keep pestering me

458
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
You are the one who made him

459
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
jealous and set fire to the square

460
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
and hurt everyone

461
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Lu Chang

462
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I am the one you married to now

463
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
But we have no relationship

464
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
between us

465
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Don't be so stubborn

466
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
with the county governor

467
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
No relationship?

468
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
What are you doing?

469
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Go away

470
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Don't come over

471
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You are so mean

472
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Give it to me

473
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I hurt you

474
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
You are thinking too much

475
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
How could I hurt myself

476
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
because of you?

477
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Don't move

478
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Lu Chang

479
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I am warning you one last time

480
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
If you hurt me and the one I love again

481
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I will not stop

482
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
and kill you

483
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
I am sorry

484
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Why are you back so late?

485
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Today is your birthday

486
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Why did you go drinking alone?

487
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
It's a good night

488
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I will drink with you

489
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
for a few more days

490
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Drink

491
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Don't worry

492
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
I am not a man

493
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
who loves a woman

494
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
for a birthday

495
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I am not a man

496
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
who loves a woman

497
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I am not a man

498
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
who loves a woman

499
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Why do you do this?

500
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
I am sorry

501
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
It's a miracle

502
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
I prepared this jade button

503
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
on the day of my birthday

504
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
I want to give it a try

505
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
No need

506
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Why did you tell me

507
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I should take it away?

508
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Why did you destroy it?

509
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,980
Why do you refuse to take this load?

510
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,160
I can build one by myself.

511
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
You didn't keep me safe from all this.

512
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,000
Yes.

513
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,800
We're a family.

514
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,480
But we lack nothing.

515
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
It's the Log de la M�i fighter.

516
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's not a wild dragon.

517
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,960
It's called Jaguar Jade.

518
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I'll go to the palace and ask for your permission.

519
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
General, you're so careless.

520
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
If I come back late,

521
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,960
you're afraid that you won't kill me with a sword, right?

522
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,960
You're not afraid that King Ning and the County Lord will kill you.

523
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,960
If I really go, I'll prepare a speech.

524
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
I won't kill King Ning.

525
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
You're right.

526
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
General, you're very thoughtful.

527
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,960
But why did you do this for someone else?

528
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
You're going to ruin your status as the Flower-Horse Envoy.

529
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I...

530
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Liu Chang took over Cao Yun.

531
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
He's not only your business partner.

532
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
If there's no way to help King Ning,

533
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
he'll go to the capital.

534
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,960
And those ships are all private goods.

535
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
They sell the goods.

536
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Liu Chang has been in the hands of many people.

537
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
I'm afraid you'll be involved in his business.

538
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I'm not a person who's broken.

539
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Today, when I saw Liu Chang,

540
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,960
I said everything I should.

541
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I shouldn't have any thoughts.

542
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
They're all broken.

543
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Please rest assured.

544
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
That's good.

545
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm the owner of the Flower-Horse Envoy.

546
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
I'll solve everything that happens in the shop.

547
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I have my own reason to solve it.

548
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I hope you can trust me.

549
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Don't worry about me anymore.

550
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,960
If there's nothing else, I'll go.

551
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Good luck.

552
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Warren.

553
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Okay.

554
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,960
I've problems with Oriole.

555
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,960
Put off any 그�� volta.

556
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Bye-bye.

557
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
No problem.

558
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I don't want you to go in about my business.

559
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm the one who should suffer.

560
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
You don't have to say anything in front of him.

561
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Yes.
