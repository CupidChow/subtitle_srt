Jingxiu Fanghua

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why did the car stop?

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the way of the government.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You dare to fight here?

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't talk nonsense with me.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, no, there are bandits.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go, go, go.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go.

Jingxiu Fanghua

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you in charge of this?

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, my dear friends.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is a good thing.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't hurt my people and flowers.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't even eat.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You all take away all the flowers.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Take away.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Go, go, go.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Minister Zheng, you are a minister.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Even the king sent people to congratulate you.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It can be seen that the minister is really

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
favored by the people.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The king gave me a few points of honor.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I am also very proud.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In the future, I will work more for the court.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To help the saints.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Minister Zheng is a high-ranking minister.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I admire him.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I hope you can remind me.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Of course, of course.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why hasn't the general returned yet?

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Did he get lost after drinking too much?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think the flowers are very good.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They are very drunk.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm afraid he's hiding in the arms of some beauty.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's sober.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Come on, come on.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's drink.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's drink.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The banquet saw that the gifts and the accounts

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
were hidden in the secret compartment of the study.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Minister Zheng.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
General.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I came to give you a toast.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
General, you are drunk.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Am I drunk?

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Where am I?

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sir.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sir.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sir.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why are you here?

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Minister Zheng is looking for you.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Today is the birthday of Minister Zheng.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How can I be so rude?

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please forgive me.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not very good at drinking.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll go first.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sir, please be careful.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not very good at drinking.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's dangerous.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The new town is very cautious.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There are also traps in the study.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Trap? Are you not hurt?

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I...

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Badaclaire worshipped the god so the god went to look for it.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's amedimcomeอ

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I coughed out so CIA came,

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but he couldn't look for his mother

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did you hear?

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
I knew it was all się

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
If they take the money and don't let go...

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Your body can't stand the night machine.

90
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
The front management is scared.

91
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
No, if you let me go, I'll go to my sister.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Don't worry, I won't make trouble when I get there.

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
If I meet any danger, I'll hide.

94
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
I'll hide and don't let anyone know.

95
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
If you don't want to go, go ahead.

96
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
You're hurt.

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
It's a small wound.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It's okay.

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
The bandits are supposed to meet at the first bridge.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Why are they here?

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
The city of Shenxian is not far from Chang'an.

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
There are no bandits from Chenqi.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
They are likely to be local farmers and hunters.

104
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,800
The place of the meeting is not far from where they are.

105
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
This is the only settlement in the city.

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
The city of Shenxian

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Someone!

108
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
No, no, no.

109
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Put the knife down.

110
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Put it down.

111
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Why are you here?

112
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Didn't you receive my second letter?

113
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Didn't you get kidnapped by the bandits?

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
What's going on?

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
It's a misunderstanding. They are not bandits.

116
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Why did you scream and shout?

117
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I was burning there.

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I got a cold.

119
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
What if the blood is back?

120
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Let Xiaochun check it for you.

121
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm fine.

122
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
But Jiang Jun...

123
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
If he doesn't save her, the blood will be drained.

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Why did you bleed so much?

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
You...

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I thought I would never see you again.

127
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm fine.

128
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm fine now.

129
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
You've been talking so much.

130
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Let me see your wound first.

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Okay?

132
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm fine.

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm fine.

134
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I'm fine.

135
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm fine.

136
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm fine.

137
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
You said before...

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
If you are in danger...

139
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
You will send me to Chang'an.

140
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
But a person...

141
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
No matter where he is...

142
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
He may be in danger.

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
It seems...

144
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I will stay by your side.

145
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I will be more at ease.

146
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Right?

147
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm going to Chang'an.

148
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay?

149
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Okay.

150
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I'm going to Chang'an.

151
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Okay.

152
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Okay.

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Bye.

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Bye.

155
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Bye.

156
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Bye.

157
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Bye.

158
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Bye.

159
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Bye.

160
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Bye.

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Bye.

162
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Bye.

163
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Bye.

164
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Bye.

165
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Bye.

166
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Bye.

167
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,320
But I'll be better after this treatment.

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,000
And in that time you'll get better health.

169
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,480
I just knew a person

170
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
who works in a bar

171
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,400
has such a MKV va firmly.

172
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,920
But if I'm not lucky that I'm a good caller looking for someone,

173
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,040
I may not be a more courtship than a horse.

174
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
I'll go back.

175
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Xiaochun,

177
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
there are many patients waiting for you in the village.

178
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Go back to your work after you've healed.

179
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I'll take care of this.

180
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Okay.

181
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Jia Zhenhui,

182
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
why?

183
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I just want to help you to get out of the heat

184
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
so that you won't regret it.

185
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
I'll go back.

186
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

187
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

188
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

189
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

190
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

191
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

192
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

193
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

194
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

195
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

196
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

197
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

198
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

199
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

200
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

201
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

202
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

203
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

204
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

205
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

206
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

207
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

208
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

209
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

210
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

211
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

212
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

213
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
I'll be safe in this coffin.

214
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,380
Sounds like rain said,

215
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:41,120
Like I've heard a dance and became coachman of replied assigns

216
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,120
One, two, who didn't see me in my dreams?

217
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,680
My love is too strong,

218
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Too hard to reach.

219
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:12,120
I would rather be aliveQUEEN?

220
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
Well, can't we just stop?

221
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm in love, you know.

222
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,640
I've never thought of leaving you.

223
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,840
That was a very diligent baby.

224
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,280
To work diligently Sponge articulation.

225
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,240
Her익 tämä möny 썸 Holz kisses 더 oh seventy one twenty three times.

226
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
You should be careful.

227
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Even if you recover, you'll be faster than others.

228
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,240
I've told you, I don't mind.

229
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
It's high fever, but it will last for a few days.

230
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
You must be careful.

231
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,240
You must wait until the fever is completely gone.

232
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Then you can move.

233
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Listen to Xiaochun.

234
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Give it to me.

235
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
I'll do it myself.

236
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Listen to Xiaochun.

237
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
If the wound is torn again,

238
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I'll trouble Xiaochun.

239
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Now Xiaochun has to take care of many patients.

240
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
She can't be tired anymore.

241
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Patients?

242
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Yes.

243
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Don't you want to know

244
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
what happened after we were robbed?

245
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I want to say that you can't make a mistake.

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
You keep it.

247
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Last night,

248
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
the two you ran into

249
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
were the bandits who robbed us.

250
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
That day,

251
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
after we were robbed,

252
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
they threatened me

253
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
and forced me to write to Fang Yuan

254
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
for ransom.

255
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,640
Come.

256
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Uncle.

257
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
Oh my god.

258
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Xiaochun?

259
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Constable, I told you

260
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
that we are not the bandits

261
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
зар given away before we escaped.

262
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
These bandits

263
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
are not real bandits.

264
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,500
And got sick before.

265
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
They are hollowed out.

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
In order to survive,

267
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,380
they only brought thorns to work on the road.

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
But I saw those kids

269
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,700
with blue masks and Psalm рубах.

270
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,180
I really couldn't 한ed up to them.

271
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,400
So,

272
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
we decided not to run.

273
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,920
To stay here.

274
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,280
To be treated about this.

275
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Villagers are a tower of vigor.

276
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,440
I'm grateful that you knew our decision.

277
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,240
So I added the second letter

278
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,680
to inform the police.

279
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
Who knew that the rafting was so fast

280
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,120
that you came here first

281
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,560
before the letter arrived?

282
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
Luckily, the bandits are fake.

283
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
If we really get into the trap,

284
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
if my sister runs away,

285
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,280
if she gets caught,

286
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm afraid we'll be caught.

287
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,240
The real bandits are also rich.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
How to make money is your sister's job.

289
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Her three-inch tongue

290
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
will not be cut off by the bandits.

291
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,040
Have some porridge.

292
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,440
Anyway,

293
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,440
Da Fu and them are not friends.

294
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,920
They are already sworn enemies.

295
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
You've been here for so long.

296
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,280
Why didn't you see Sister Da Fu?

297
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,000
I found out from Xiao Chen

298
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
that the disease of the patient here

299
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,360
is very similar to the plague

300
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,000
that happened four years ago.

301
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,840
The medicine needs to be fed.

302
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,640
So I sent Da Fu

303
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,400
to pick flowers in the square overnight.

304
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,720
He should be back by today.

305
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,560
You haven't told me about you.

306
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,760
What happened to your wound?

307
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm just doing something for the Third Master.

308
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,920
I'm just being polite.

309
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Don't you have a golden armor?

310
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
It's hard to find a good partner in the family.

311
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,160
It's not good if you find out.

312
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,800
It seems that General has a deep interest

313
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,000
in the show.

314
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
It's because I didn't tell you.

315
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,320
I'm the only one who dares to go to the show.

316
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,040
What's wrong?

317
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
Is your wound torn?

318
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Let me see.

319
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,360
Don't get too excited.

320
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,160
Mudan.

321
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,640
When did you leave last night?

322
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,880
You were so confused.

323
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,880
You didn't say anything, did you?

324
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,120
I put on a few handkerchiefs.

325
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,000
You just got hot and left.

326
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,120
Before I left,

327
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,800
you were sleeping.

328
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
What's wrong?

329
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,560
Did you have a nightmare?

330
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,160
Nothing.

331
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,920
I just remembered the ice on my handkerchief last night.

332
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,240
I just said it.

333
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,240
Come and play store.

334
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
Mom will give you a good towel.

335
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,720
Here.

336
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
那,那.

337
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,200
Aren't you going to General O sir's room to take a rest?

338
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,680
Why do you come out?

339
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
When did you care so much about me?

340
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,800
I listened to your orders.

341
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,660
Did you see

342
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
I went to the village to pick up Sister Da Fu.

343
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,380
Go and have a look.

344
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
I have something to say.

345
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,180
I folded the jade hairpin you gave me.

346
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,500
After the fire in the garden,

347
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,740
I saw you with my own eyes.

348
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,700
I was wrong.

349
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,100
I'm sorry.

350
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,220
Why did you tell me this today?

351
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,460
You were injured and bled so much to save Sister.

352
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,500
You were so late that you didn't even frown.

353
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,020
You were unconscious all night.

354
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,380
The first word you said to me

355
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,580
was to wipe the blood off your face.

356
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,340
I don't want you to feel guilty.

357
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,540
You are sincere to Sister.

358
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,500
And you have the ability to protect her.

359
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,260
I don't want you to feel guilty because of me.

360
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,660
I didn't love you for nothing.

361
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,740
You've always been sincere to her.

362
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,900
Don't worry.

363
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,620
I won't tell her about this.

00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,140
It's more discounted.

377
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,140
The air conditioner doesn't work.

378
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,140
Taobao Shankou, order takeout.

379
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,020
It's more discounted.

380
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,860
Taobao Shankou, order takeout.

381
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,660
It's more discounted.

382
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,420
Taobao Shankou, order takeout.

383
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,140
It's more discounted.

384
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Don't you mind about my sister's feelings?

385
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,780
Muta taught you the Chinese characters to cure your disease.

386
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,980
She treated you well and didn't want to return your kindness.

387
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,500
You showed her a desire to gain the love of her own.

388
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
That's why you are such a good girl.

389
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
But it's not about love between men and women.

390
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,180
It's about the love between family.

391
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
Mudan is your brother.

392
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Even if you make a mistake,

393
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,180
he will teach you and never leave you.

394
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
If you change your mind,

395
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Fang Yuan will always be your home.

396
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,180
And Mudan will always be your sister.

397
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Yes.

398
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
Come on, Zhao.

399
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
I met a big man on my way here.

400
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
I know the reason.

401
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Compared to the former country,

402
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
the village needs food and medicine more.

403
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,180
So I brought all the things in the house.

404
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
Good, Chang Yu.

405
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
They will definitely bow to you.

406
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Let's go and see my brother.

407
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,180
I don't bow to your brother.

408
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
I…

409
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
You are taller than me.

410
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,180
No.

411
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
You have big eyes.

412
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
You don't like them.

413
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
I…

414
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
Chang Yu, your husband is injured.

415
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
You should go and see him.

416
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Yes.

417
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
I will take you to see him later.

418
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Did you send someone to the house of the owner?

419
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
I have sent the man to send the money and the mudan.

420
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,180
Good.

421
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Is it good?

422
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Yes.

423
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
Who are you?

424
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,180
What is this?

425
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Your Excellency,

426
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
we are the flower merchants passing by.

427
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
We happened to find out that there were four women

428
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
and one man was missing.

429
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,180
So we brought some food and medicine to help.

430
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
The valley is heavily polluted.

431
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
You are not related to the people of the holy county.

432
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Why are you so kind?

433
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Do you want to seduce children and sell them to the people?

434
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Come on.

435
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Tie them up.

436
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Yes.

437
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Why are you still here?

438
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Why are you still here?

439
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Your Excellency,

440
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,180
if I really want to seduce children,

441
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
I should take the family name and the name of the fruit.

442
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Your Excellency,

443
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,180
you can check the goods on the carriage in person.

444
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
If there are no people,

445
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
they will take the mudan and these things to control people.

446
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
Hide the goods.

447
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
Yes.

448
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
Your Excellency.

449
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
Your Excellency.

450
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
Village head.

451
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Village head.

452
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Village head.

453
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,180
He shopkeeper really came to give us medicine.

454
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Chao Chao's mother is well.

455
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Chao Chao, right?

456
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
A female shopkeeper is so well-known.

457
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
Our family is very famous in Chang'an.

458
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Saint.

459
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,180
Do you know why the name of the fruit is so important?

460
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
The leader of the country.

461
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
He even wrote the four characters of the country.

462
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
It's hanging in our garden.

463
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
Take you to see.

464
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Have you seen the saint?

465
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Your Excellency.

466
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
We have no bad intentions.

467
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,180
You ask me why I want to save these villagers.

468
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Women are not easy to deal with.

469
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
All the way,

470
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,180
there are many people who are not relatives,

471
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
who help each other.

472
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
They are not relatives,

473
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
they are good people.

474
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
Your Excellency is a scholar.

475
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,180
And a parent.

476
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I believe you can understand.

477
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Of course I can understand.

478
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,180
I can understand.

479
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I was just a loving and caring person.

480
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
You are kind, there is no problem.

481
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
But you have to tell me in advance.

482
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,180
The treatment of the disease is related to the life.

483
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
If you call someone,

484
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
you will be in the court.

485
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
You will not be able to wait for me.

486
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
If I really am a loving and caring person,

487
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
we won't stand here today.

488
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
What do you mean?

489
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
You are mocking my negligence.

490
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Yes.

491
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
The negligence of the official is not allowed to speak to the people.

492
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
You.

493
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
We have a little tongue.

494
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Don't argue with him.

495
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
He is so big,

496
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
and still young.

497
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
Take him away.

498
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Yes.

499
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Look, what kind of official I am.

500
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Your Excellency,

501
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
I want to be like the lady.

502
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
Your Excellency,

503
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,180
although he is so big,

504
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,180
he is very confused.

505
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,180
He doesn't understand what you are talking about.

506
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
I will go with you.

507
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
You can't go.

508
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
I scolded him.

509
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,180
Kill or beat me.

510
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Come on.

511
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Take him away.

512
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
Yes.

513
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Your Excellency.

514
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Come back.

515
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Your Excellency.

516
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,180
Your Excellency.

517
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Your Excellency.

518
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
Your Excellency.

519
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Come back.

520
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
Zhao Zhou, take your father and sister back.

521
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Your Excellency,

522
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
you take these goods in first.

523
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
We will be back soon.

524
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Don't worry.

525
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Okay.

526
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Your Excellency.

527
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Look.

528
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Look.

529
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Don't say that you are buying medicine for money.

530
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
The granary in the county

531
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
has been empty for a mouse.

532
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
I have a good one.

533
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
You think I don't want to be a good official?

534
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,180
I didn't hear that the county had a flood last year.

535
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Where is the money?

536
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
The granary is in a bad condition.

537
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,180
The money and the grain are probably

538
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
all gone.

539
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
I am also a poor man.

540
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
I thought I could make a living

541
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,180
by doing this.

542
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
Who knows?

543
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,180
I am not as good as you women.

544
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,180
I used to think that

545
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,180
officials are very powerful.

546
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,180
I didn't expect that

547
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
when the officials were

548
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
pressuring us,

549
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,180
we would not be able to do anything.

550
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
In this world,

551
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,180
it is not easy to be a citizen,

552
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,180
a businessman or an official.

553
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,180
If we want to be fair and peaceful,

554
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,180
we cannot do it.

555
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,180
Neither can we.

556
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Then,

557
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
we have no hope.

558
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
I think

559
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,180
we have no hope.

560
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,180
No.

561
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
There must be a group of people

562
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
who are willing

563
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
to create a great world

564
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
for the people.

565
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,180
The water is clear and the moon is bright.

566
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,180
The river flows into the city.

567
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,180
The moon is bright and the flowers are beautiful.

568
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,180
The river flows into the city.

569
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:04,180
The river flows into the city.

570
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,180
The flowers are Canvasucca and in the fifth place

571
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,180
the haze fall into the sea.

572
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,180
Also what must happen

573
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,180
the flowers are Duck.

574
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Don't listen to him.

575
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
What?

576
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Ahhh,

577
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
I see.

578
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
There is.

579
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
It's so lucky.

580
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,180
There are other kinds of flowers in the garden.

581
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Come back!

582
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
This is the same flower.

583
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Yes.

584
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Pick it up.

585
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Done.

586
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Let's go.

587
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
One!

588
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Two!

589
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Three!

590
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Four!

591
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Five!

592
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Four!

593
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
Welcome to the garden.

594
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Let me help you.

595
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Can you do it?

596
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Come on.

597
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Come on.

598
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Who is it?

599
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Who is playing tricks there?

600
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Come out!

601
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Who?

602
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Jiang Changyang?

603
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
I've been busy all day.

604
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
I'm here to help you.

605
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
You haven't recovered for a long time.

606
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Why are you scaring me?

607
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
Why are you still wearing this clothes?

608
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
It's going to rain.

609
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Everyone is busy.

610
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
I'm the only one who can help you.

611
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,180
Only this one is found in the village.

612
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
How can we take care of both of us

613
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
with this clothes?

614
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Besides, even if it rains later,

615
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
you have to wear this clothes.

616
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
Let's go.

617
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
My wound is almost healed.

618
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
If you're sick and delay the rescue,

619
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,180
I'll be in big trouble.

620
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
Enough.

621
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,180
If you keep talking,

622
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
it will rain.

623
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
I'm much stronger than you.

624
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
This way.

625
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Okay.

626
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,180
The stars are out.

627
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
It seems that it won't rain tonight.

628
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Let's take a break.

629
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Okay.

630
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Come on.

631
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Before you left Chang'an,

632
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
people were very happy.

633
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,180
When I folded a single peony,

634
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,180
and saved lives,

635
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,180
I figured it out.

636
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,180
When I first learned about my mother,

637
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,180
I was really disappointed.

638
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
I thought I had no future.

639
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,180
But who knew that I came to the holy land,

640
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
and I changed my mind.

641
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
Good and evil are not in one mind.

642
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
Peony used to be a poison,

643
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
but now it can be a antidote.

644
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,180
My mother didn't save the refugees

645
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
and died of a severe cold.

646
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,180
I'll make up for her.

647
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I'll use my experience

648
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
to save more people.

649
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
What about Wu Bo?

650
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
I...

651
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
During this time,

652
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
I've heard two voices in the forest.

653
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,180
One told me that

654
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
evil must be repaid.

655
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,180
I hope Wu Bo will never

656
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
leave this shadow.

657
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,180
But another voice kept telling me

658
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
that Wu Bo is a victim.

659
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Sometimes it's hard to make a choice

660
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
between punishment and forgiveness.

661
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
I can only say that

662
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,180
everything is connected to the disaster of the world.

663
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
It's unfair.

664
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,180
I can't hate him,

665
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,180
but I can't forgive him either.

666
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,180
But since my mother chose to let him go,

667
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,180
I won't go against my mother's will.

668
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,180
I don't think she wants to see me

669
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,180
punishing herself like this.

670
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
All I can do

671
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,180
is to figure out how to go on

672
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
the next road.

673
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
You won't be in the court

674
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
if you cure the villagers and return to Chang'an, right?

675
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
The villagers despise the merchants

676
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
and think they're easy to deal with.

677
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
I want to use my father as an example

678
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,180
and do my best

679
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,180
to change the people's prejudice against merchants.

680
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I want to let everyone know

681
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
that not only can we learn from the lessons,

682
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
but we can also learn from the merchants.

683
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Do you know

684
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
that this is a very difficult road?

685
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,940
The migrant catinse

686
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
is in the mountain.

687
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,220
It creates problems in the country.

688
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,820
When I saw when the saint Latin

689
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,180
herb worked fatherNG having nothing to eat 기대

690
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
this always happened.

691
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,180
Char Leaving a scrumper

692
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
The inverter has the same energy as the full- 1944 manhiel

693
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
.

694
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
A 물�Á

695
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
and the whole world is in danger.

696
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
We can't afford to be in danger.

697
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,580
The ants are close to everything.

698
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,300
The one who can save them is always in danger.

699
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,380
Only those who have the power

700
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,740
can really know the lives of the people.

701
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,220
Only then can we not be ants,

702
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,260
but humans,

703
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
and live in peace.

704
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,660
Jiang Changyang,

705
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
your dream has become my wish

706
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,340
from today.

707
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm doing this because I don't want to be a part of it.

708
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,940
I want to support the saints who love the people.

709
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,500
Only by saying the word of peace

710
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,500
can the people of the world live in peace.

711
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,140
Only then can ordinary people

712
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,380
be able to enjoy the beauty of the peonies.

713
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,220
Look.

714
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,180
These are the three-leaf clover.

715
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,380
Because you're seriously injured and lost your blood,

716
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,060
Xiaochun accidentally found them in the sacred forest.

717
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,380
You want the villagers to live on this?

718
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,900
There are many herbs in the sacred forest.

719
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,580
As long as you can separate them one by one,

720
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,180
you can get them and sell them.

721
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,500
This can slow down the survival of the villagers.

722
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,420
But

723
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,540
the people who have the power

724
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,860
have a harder life.

725
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,700
I must think

726
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,020
what is the outcome

727
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,500
of our lives

728
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,380
will be.

729
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,340
Due to the illness

730
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,180
you've to run,

731
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,580
train and do everything right

732
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,980
so that at some point

733
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,020
the enemy won't even know

734
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,220
how long it will be.

735
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,860
How much women

736
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,620
have you killed?

737
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,400
Montage

738
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
I want to put her back in the temple.

739
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,540
I hope you will be safe.

740
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,540
I also hope you will bless her with no more illness.

741
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,540
ZhaoZhao, did you ever pray to the gods when she was sick?

742
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,540
Yes.

743
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
How is her illness?

744
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,540
No. But the sisters came.

745
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,540
ZhaoZhao, the gods are in the sky, high and far away.

746
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
And there are many people praying to them every day.

747
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
But they can't hear you.

748
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,540
The sisters have their own home.

749
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,540
They can't stay here forever.

750
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,540
So, it's better to pray to the gods.

751
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
Pray to the gods?

752
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
But I can't do anything.

753
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,540
As long as you study hard, you will learn something.

754
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,540
ZhaoZhao, you have to be strong.

755
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
Then you can protect yourself and your family forever.

756
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
Do you understand?

757
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,540
I will be a shopkeeper like Wudan.

758
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,540
I will earn a lot of money and help many people.

759
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Good girl.

760
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,540
The End

761
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
The End

762
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,540
The End

763
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,540
The End

764
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
The End

765
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
The End

766
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
The End
