2
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,016

3
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:11,030

4
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,100
My private warehouse is guarded in three shifts day and night.

5
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,719
How could mere water bandits possibly sneak in and steal things?

6
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,859
Moreover, no one has reported any thefts previously.

7
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:32,100
It must be those water bandits spouting nonsense.

8
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,780
They said this fire oil was rare and hard to come by.

9
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,080
They secretly hid a jar before committing arson.

10
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,839
Let's bring them up in a moment. Compare the two oils, and it'll become clear.

11
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,580
Why would these water bandits burn your garden for no reason?

12
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,300
They were hired by someone, paid to do the job.

13
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,779
Who has the audacity to harm my Floral Envoy?!

14
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:05,490
Your Majesty, the water bandits confessed that it was

15
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,510
County Princess Ji An.

16
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:25,800
Your Majesty, I've never met this person. This is slander.

17
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,580
You Zhen is a lady of the inner chambers. What would she know about fire oil?

18
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,780
There must be some misunderstanding.

19
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,020
If the County Princess says no, I certainly believe it.

20
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,580
What truth could possibly come from the mouths of water bandits?

21
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,160
They probably stole the fire oil and wanted to frame the County Princess.

22
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,239
However, the oil has burned down to just 50 barrels. There's no further evidence.

23
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,059
We don't know how much they actually stole at the beginning.

24
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:02,859
What if they hid more than one jar? What if they have other accomplices?

25
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:06,059
Wouldn't that mean Chang'an is in grave danger?

26
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,700
Jingzhao Prefecture stop overseeing this matter. Leave it to Ministry of Justice.

27
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,019
On what date was the fire oil confiscated? How long did it remain in the treasury?

28
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,200
Through whose hands did it pass? Do the water bandits have accomplices?

29
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,460
Have they hidden any other dangerous items?

30
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,260
You must investigate all this thoroughly.

31
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,379
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,339
No need to investigate further. I'm the one who did it.

33
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,420
Your Majesty, I was dissatisfied because my husband cared for his ex-wife.

34
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,339
This drove me to irrationality and I sought revenge.

35
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,140
I stole fire oil from my father's treasury and had Fragrance Garden set on fire.

36
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,060
You Zhen, you're so muddled!

37
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,099
This now involves the Ministry of Justice.

38
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:08,299
I don't wish my mistake to tarnish my father's reputation, bringing him trouble.

39
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,739
I'm terrified and full of regret.

40
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,820
I beg Your Majesty for forgiveness.

41
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:22,480
Previously, Liu Chang searched my store, and now you set fire to my garden.

42
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,979
You two are taking turns targeting me.

43
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,339
Is it because you're jealous Mu Dan and I are in love and wealth is pouring in for us?

44
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,400
Your Highness, you must stand up for me.

45
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,020
Otherwise, I'll never dare to set foot in your mansion again.

46
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:49,380
Rest assured, Sui Zhi. I'll give you a proper explanation.

47
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,539
A prince who commits a crime is subject to the same punishment as a commoner.

48
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,390
This is You Zhen's fault.

49
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,380
Without punishment, it won't appease the public's anger.

50
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,399
Official Ren handle this according to the law.

51
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,579
For intentional arson, it warrants...

52
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,299
three years of penal servitude and exile of 2,000 li.

53
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,199
Okay.

54
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,260
However, considering her voluntary confession,

55
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,060
the punishment can be reduced.

56
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,650
Why not...

57
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,060
Why not impose a light punishment as a warning? Your Majesty, what do you think?

58
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,179
Your righteous stand against personal ties truly sets an example for all ministers.

59
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:58,339
No matter what, You Zhen is my niece.

60
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,539
Receiving punishment in public would be disgraceful to the royal family's dignity.

61
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,659
Just punish her privately in the palace and give the people an explanation.

62
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,779
Yes, Your Majesty.

63
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,620
The one who suffered from this is Sui Zhi. Does this handling of it satisfy you?

64
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,380
Your Majesty is wise, I'm certainly satisfied.

65
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,940
Public grievances are appeased, but funds for repairing the garden are still needed.

66
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:32,260
I'll have the money for repairing Fragrance Garden sent to your residence tomorrow.

67
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

68
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:03,639
Your Highness, it's time.

69
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:55,800
♫  The Luo River cleanses the ridges of the moonlight  ♫

70
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,603
♫  Flowing into a scorching, endless river  ♫

71
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:08,015
♫  A beauty refuses the temptation of the mortal world  ♫

72
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:15,428
♫  Youthful splendor charts its own wandering course  ♫

73
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:20,303
♫  Do not let the mundane world bind you,  ♫

74
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:23,371
nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you ♫

75
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:29,967
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

76
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:35,818
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

77
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,719
♫  And never withering  ♫

78
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:44,919
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

79
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,760
Did the fire in Fragrance Garden burn vigorously?

80
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:33,240
Is appreciating flowers under the glow of the fire unique?

81
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,200
Thanks to you, the great fire created a new type of peony, Burnt Bone Red Jade.

82
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,240
It also burned you, Li You Zhen.

83
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,140
It seems the karmic cycle of the world is indeed interesting.

84
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,620
A mere merchant, and you dare speak to me like this.

85
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,819
Even if I suffered a punishment, so what?

86
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,340
I'm the County Princess of the current dynasty.

87
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:19,280
In the future, as long as I wish, do you think you can stay alive?

88
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,740
When we joined forces in Luoyang, you knew I had no feelings for Liu Chang.

89
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,779
Why still repeatedly plot against me?

90
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,520
Because of you, I'm unable to bear children.

91
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,120
Because of you, Zi Shu won't even spare me a glance.

92
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,659
Do you know the worse than death feeling of being torn apart in marriage?

93
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,690
Each day Zi Shu can't let go of you,

94
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,900
you living is a sin.

95
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,820
But I'm not the only one you harmed.

96
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,039
What wrong have those innocent people in Fragrance Garden done?

97
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,579
Those ants are only fit to be in your company.

98
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,900
What does their life or death have to do with me?

99
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,179
In your eyes, common people are all ants.

100
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,740
But isn't your luxurious lifestyle

101
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,380
built on the grain and bricks laid down by these ants?

102
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,099
Being so obsessed over someone who doesn't love you,

103
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:38,340
turning into a bloodstained monster, doesn't it make you feel sorrow?

104
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,220
Without obsession, how can one speak of love?

105
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,900
You don't even know what I've been through before.

106
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,699
As women, it isn't easy for us to establish ourselves and make a living.

107
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,179
Some are treated as pawns in the struggle for power and profit.

108
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,640
While others can only serve as playthings for men's amusement.

109
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,519
There are even women who can't be called human, discarded like worn-out shoes.

110
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:24,260
Many times, we have no choice.

111
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:31,299
Since this is the case, why not live for ourselves when we have the choice?

112
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,800
Why make things difficult for each other?

113
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,179
Being rigid leads to breakage, holding on leads to delusion.

114
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,140
There isn't only one person to love, nor only one thing to seek in this vast world.

115
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,790
I hope you take care of yourself

116
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,340
and not harm others and yourself anymore.

117
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,500
Mu Dan.

118
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,579
Only these are left to be moved.

119
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,620
Da Fu, you've worked hard these days. Thank you for helping me move.

120
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,420
It's nothing.

121
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,319
When you got married, Master Jiang said sweet words, like he couldn't live without you.

122
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:38,619
How long was it before he got engaged to someone else?

123
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,539
You worked so hard to earn so much money for him.

124
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,040
He didn't treat you well and even drove you away, so heartless.

125
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,299
You misunderstood. Jiang Chang Yang didn't drive me away.

126
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:51,179
I wanted to leave myself. It has nothing to do with him.

127
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,020
At this point, you're still speaking up for that heartless man.

128
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,639
It's true, Jiang Chang Yang isn't like that.

129
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,419
He said peonies are useless.

130
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,020
A person who was so afraid of fire risked his life to save the flowers for me.

131
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:12,020
There are many things between him and me that only we know about.

132
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,240
In short, he's a very good person.

133
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,740
The world has misunderstood him far too much.

134
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,779
Don't blame him.

135
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,659
The feelings between men and women are really hard to understand.

136
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,980
But since you said so, I believe you.

137
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,140
I just hope you won't be too sad and treat yourself a little better.

138
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,880
Rest assured, I'm fine.

139
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:17,500

140
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,840

141
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,050

142
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:50,419
Does Master Jiang regret it and want to keep you?

143
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,040
Da Fu, give that to me.

144
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,500
Go inside and see if anything was left behind, go on.

145
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:17,480
I'm back to pack up things, and return these back to their owner.

146
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,220

147
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,599
I'll the divorce letter.

148
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,519
It only counts once the names are filled in.

149
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,359
I'll fill it in now. Where's the brush and ink?

150
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,580
I haven't prepared them.

151
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,860
What do you mean by this?

152
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,019
You're about to get married. It's not appropriate for me to stay here any longer.

153
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:51,470
Rest assured, I'll explain to Xue Xi.

154
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,380
- I won't let her misunderstand us.
 - When was I marrying Xue Xi?

155
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,739
I have only sibling feelings for her.

156
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,939
Are you leaving because of this?

157
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,919
It's... not just because of this matter.

158
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,879
No matter what the cause is, this is all a misunderstanding.

159
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:22,019
The Royal Princess didn't decree the marriage, and I won't marry Xue Xi.

160
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,720
I've already driven away the people the Imperial Workshop.

161
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,060
As long as the Jiang Residence stands for a day, this courtyard will always be yours.

162
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,480
You already know.

163
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,820
I vow to live alone for life, not marrying anyone.

164
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,079
Do you truly... have no one you admire?

165
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,900
No.

166
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,119
Isn't it good to be free and unrestrained?

167
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,040
Indeed.

168
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,739
Being carefree is quite good.

169
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,699
Regarding the matter of the oil, Prince Ning and Li You Zhen must bear a grudge.

170
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:41,179
If you move away now, it'll not only arouse their suspicion,

171
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,620
but your safety might also be at risk.

172
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:50,739
I know, this is a temporary measure.

173
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:53,340
You can only bear with it for a while longer.

174
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,319
Keep this divorce letter safe for now.

175
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:04,079
Once you're safe, you can fill in the date at any time

176
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,079
and disengage and leave.

177
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:13,390

178
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:24,259
With you being so righteous, how could I feel wronged?

179
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,619
At this critical moment, if anything happens at the Jiang Residence,

180
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,499
Prince Ning will seize upon it, bringing us trouble.

181
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,319
We should be more cautious and careful.

182
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:43,820
Since the act must continue,
how can this evidence remain?

183
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,299
How is You Zhen's injury?

184
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,839
The royal medicine was applied, and it has scabbed over already.

185
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,399
The physician said it won't scar.

186
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:30,399
You Zhen's punishment this time was quite unjust.

187
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:35,919
Only you can soothe this grievance.

188
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,419
I understand. I'll surely accompany You Zhen well.

189
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,419
Your Highness, You Zhen was punished, and the fire oil confiscated.

190
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:57,100
Even the military arsenal outside the city has temporarily ceased operations.

191
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,820
Do you still believe Jiang Chang Yang is innocent?

192
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,979

193
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:10,380
His Highness has sent me to investigate secretly.

194
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,699
The hidden losses we've suffered over the years weren't caused by him.

195
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:21,019
When I came to the capital to take office, I specifically visited the Jiang Residence.

196
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:26,319
Jiang Chang Yang was subtly asking me for favors.

197
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,540
In my view, he doesn't care who holds the reins of power.

198
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,960
He only cares about how much gold he has.

199
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,860
Better to judge a person's intent than their outward appearance.

200
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,280
But judging intent isn't as good as choosing the means.

201
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,960
Jiang Chang Yang repeatedly claims to desire wealth and women.

202
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,519
It's seemingly flawless, but in reality,

203
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,900
this outcome caused Your Highness considerable loss.

204
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,280
Zi Shu's words are indeed true.

205
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:07,699
Whether intentional or not, this person must be investigated.

206
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,699
Your Highness is wise.

207
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,100
Master Jiang indulged in pleasure for years, and everyone's guard is down.

208
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,900
If it was all an act,

209
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,340
seeing his close relationship with His Majesty, how could one not be afraid?

210
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:30,459
The wild goose leaves its mark as it passes. Where do you think his mark lies?

211
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:36,759
Because of the Royal Princess's guarantee, we weren't able to search his residence.

212
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,799
I wanted to insert new spies inside but it's never been successful.

213
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:47,639
Currently, the only person who understands the Jiang Residence the best is her.

214
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:56,100
Lian Zhou volunteered to serve at Captain Pei's mansion to make amends for past wrongs.

215
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:00,040
The valuable rewards that were obtained have all been taken away.

216
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,104
Only these are left.

217
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:08,219
Lian Zhou wasn't favored, spending all day withering at the Jiang Residence.

218
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,380
When idle, she copied garden scenes and painted fan surfaces.

219
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,200
How have Consort Shu's sleep and meals been lately?

220
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,459
Your Majesty,

221
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,800
after using Miss He's sachet, she can sleep for eight hours every night.

222
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,119
The meals tastes much better as well.

223
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,300
I can rest assured then. After giving birth, her stomach is weak and she's fatigued.

224
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,499
Even though it's hot, she must not indulge in coldness.

225
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:03,499
Eat fewer chilled lychees and have her soak her feet in hot water before bed.

226
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:05,320
I'll return now.

227
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,830

228
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,500

229
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:50,699
This game was played beautifully.

230
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,179
Someone is getting restless and is about to make a move.

231
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,380
Are you playing chess or exchanging riddles here?

232
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,780
So profound and unfathomable.

233
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,219
You aren't only handsome, but possess extraordinary chess skills.

234
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:15,699
Truly an elite among men.

235
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,259
Your words are so sweet today.

236
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,379
Are you trying to sell something you made to Third Young Master again?

237
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,699
Why can't Mu Dan praise me?

238
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:27,499
Exactly, I've always thought Third Young Master has extraordinary presence.

239
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:30,600
Not like your group of riff-raff friends.

240
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:36,699
You'll surely become a famous scholar. Could you write a calligraphy piece for me?

241
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:39,380
I want to hang it at Floral Haven to decorate the place.

242
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,699
Could you write The Best in the World for me?

243
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,879
What's so difficult about that? Don't you have several shops?

244
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,499
- Yes.
 - I'll write one for each shop.

245
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,319
- Good, very good.
 - Wait.

246
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,100
Wait a minute, you seem very strange today.

247
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,340
Did something happen just now when you entered the palace?

248
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,179
Speaking of entering the palace, it causes such a headache.

249
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,580
Consort Shu's illness truly worries me.

250
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
What's wrong with Consort Shu?

251
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,820
She has contracted a strange illness.

252
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,259
It's tricky and easy to treat at the same time.

253
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:19,319
It's just lacking a medicinal guide, but this guide is hard to find.

254
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,079
What medicinal guide?

255
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,739
This is the medicinal guide.

256
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:10,639
Master Jiang, His Highness is here.

257
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,900
Your Highness,

258
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,159
kill me. If I don't die,

259
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:33,860
the blood of Prince Qin will be tainted.

260
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:42,900
I'm willing to die to prove Your Highness's innocence.

261
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:52,219
Your Highness, the Prime Minister's achievements are so great and mustn't be killed.

262
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:56,100
Think through it, Your Highness.

263
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,110
All these years,

264
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,060
you've governed the nation and authored books.

265
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,580
Sui Zhi, I toast you.

266
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,140
You Zhen and Zi Shu are foolish and disturbed your peace.

267
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,620
The good wine, good food, and this good show,

268
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,856
I hope can dispel your resentment.

269
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:24,780
Please don't harbor any animosity towards me.

270
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,620
Your Highness is overthinking it.

271
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,319
You always think of me. How could I blame Your Highness?

272
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,140
Let's not mention these unhappy things. Let's drink this cup to the fullest.

273
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,040
Drink to the fullest.

274
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,139
Just now, I heard you said you had prepared a gift for Sui Zhi.

275
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:50,659
So many chests were brought in. I thought a beauty would come out of them.

276
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:54,660
But who knew it was just a few puppets.

277
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:59,100
I heard that Sui Zhi loves to watch this.

278
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,939
I just got a new show, so I brought it to Jiang Residence to enjoy together.

279
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,860
Do you like it, Sui Zhi?

280
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,459
Your Highness is thoughtful.

281
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:12,659
But I prefer plays about talented scholars and beautiful women.

282
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,219
A group of men scheming against each other isn't interesting.

283
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,580
The Prime Minister has passed away.

284
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,300
Prime Minister Lu served as the imperial regent under the First Emperor.

285
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:53,499
He rendered great service to the Qin Dynasty, yet ended up with such a fate.

286
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:57,219
What a pity!

287
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,939
I really dislike the First Emperor.

288
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:03,860
Brutal and unkind, repays kindness with enmity.

289
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:11,159
Seeing Prime Minister Lu makes me sigh deeply.

290
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:18,940
I'm getting old, I should... retire and live in seclusion.

291
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,100
Your Highness thinks too much.

292
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,240
His Majesty and Your Highness are brothers.

293
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,200
How can the First Emperor compare to Prime Minister Lu?

294
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,499
My brother.

295
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,050
Your Majesty.

296
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,939
These years, it's thanks to you for sharing my worries.

297
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:50,340
The civil and military officials in the court make my head ache with their quarrels.

298
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,240
The officials in the prefectures are never at peace for a day.

299
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,659
I can't do without you.

300
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,480
We're blood-connected. You must help me.

301
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:14,060
Your Majesty, the court affairs occur frequently, the household is hard to keep stable.

302
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,860
I'm exhausted. A solitary tree cannot support itself.

303
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:27,900
It's been a long time since we've spoken like this.

304
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,979
My brother.

305
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:39,780
Sui Zhi, I heard there is good wine hidden in the mansion.

306
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:45,019
I just acquired ten jars of top-quality Frozen Spring.

307
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:47,960
I'll go fetch them. Today, we drink till we're merry.

308
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,939
- Okay.
 - Sui Zhi.

309
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:54,639
There's no need for you to fetch it. I'll have a servant go get it.

310
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,620
No need to trouble Your Highness, I'll go myself.

311
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,659
Sui Zhi.

312
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,259
The Jiang Mansion isn't a fairy palace maze.

313
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:12,699
Is it possible my people can't even find a jar of wine?

314
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,780
Reward them!

315
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

316
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,280
My brother.

317
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,040
You're drunk.

318
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,139
Vice Minister Liu, well…

319
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:56,280
Invited by His Highness, we're entering the mansion to seek wine.

320
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,420
Yes.

321
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:11,380
Today's wine is good, the play is good.

322
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,300
I'll play a piece for Your Majesty and Your Highness.

323
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,979
With music to accompany the wine, is that not wonderful?

324
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:21,780
- Good.
 - Bring my zither.

325
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,580
Yes.

326
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,680

327
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,300
 The fan depicts a house from the Jiang Residence.

328
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,499
 Both sides should have equal structure and uniform layout.

329
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:16,780
 But the west courtyard has a window, while the east becomes a wall.

330
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,860
 The stone foundation underneath is also somewhat different.

331
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,839
 I'm afraid there might be a secret chamber hidden underneath this wall.

332
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:29,839
 Please allow me to investigate the Jiang Residence.

333
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,380
Vice Minister Liu it has two doors and four windows like the west courtyard.

334
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,800
- Guest room, one door and two windows.
 - Vice Minister Liu,

335
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,799
all the fine wines of the Jiang Residence are here. You may select at will.

336
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,979
There's no need to mobilize so many people.

337
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:50,820
Aged fine wine has been stored too long. I'm afraid you might miss some.

338
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,479
Let me go and look for it myself.

339
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,879
This place is near Young Madam's courtyard.

340
00:37:56,879 --> 00:38:00,280
In recent days, she's troubled by headaches due to Fragrance Garden's renovations.

341
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,380
She can't bear the noise.

342
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,059
How about you sit in the side hall while I invite Young Madam...?

343
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,680
Miss He is unwell and should rest properly.

344
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,280
The social matters between gentlemen shouldn't trouble the women.

345
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:41,180
Sui Zhi has already nodded. Are you disrespecting your master?

346
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:46,860
Or do you not respect His Highness?

347
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,220
I dare not.

348
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,860
Since there are many imperial gifts in the mansion,

349
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,199
I'm afraid you might damage something that can't be compensated.

350
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,799
- How about I lead the way for you?
 - No need, search.

351
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:13,059
Sui Zhi's zither skills have truly improved.

352
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,120
Brother, don't just focus on the music, drink.

353
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,039
- Your Majesty.
 - My brother, sit.

354
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:16,059
My brother, there's no more wine. When will it arrive?

355
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,590
Your Majesty, don't worry.

356
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,030
Good wine will take some time.

357
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:37,619
Okay now.

358
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,680
This piece is your specialty, how did you play the wrong note?

359
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,959
Have your skills dulled or is something on your mind?

360
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:17,940

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining

362
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:34,870
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

363
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:43,384
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

364
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:51,476
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

365
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:59,728
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

366
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:08,125
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

367
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:16,312
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

368
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:24,628
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

369
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:32,628
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

370
00:43:52,596 --> 00:44:00,780
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

371
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,231
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

372
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:16,317
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

373
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:24,526
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

374
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:32,888
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

375
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:41,044
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

376
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:49,572
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

377
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:57,672
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
