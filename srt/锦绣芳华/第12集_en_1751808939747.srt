1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
But anything stands to reason.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,440
CINEMACOLOGY

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,560
PP

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,060
such as Lu Wenzhui and Li Zhjakhigall

5
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,400
and so many others

6
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:27,960
The

7
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
money

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Leader of the generates an order to findREOS and Singapore

9
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:47,400
Police department

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
They ate the fat meat that was sent to them.

11
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
But they didn't know that it would be stuck in their throats.

12
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
After tonight, Prince Ning's fortune was completely ruined.

13
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
It's not just about fortune.

14
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Shui Yue didn't tell you what goods they were carrying?

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
You don't know about him. He's a talkative man.

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
He doesn't even talk in dreams.

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Prince Ning is very ambitious.

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
If he wants to hold the military power, he needs to be equipped with a weapon.

19
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,400
What kind of private weapon did you use before he was killed?

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Liu Chang even dared to carry copper and iron mines.

21
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Why wouldn't he dare to carry the eggs of Prince Ning?

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
You're too fishy. I can't eat it.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Take it to feed the wild cat.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
The flower bird is still in the air.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
It's the first fish in spring.

26
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
It's not good for the cold.

27
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The fish caught a cold.

28
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
It's only worth the price tomorrow.

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I can't see it with my own eyes.

30
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
It's a big deal.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You've been planning for a long time.

32
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
You should write something.

33
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,400
And don't let Prince Ning burn innocent people.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
It's time to go.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll be back in a moment.

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Prince Ning.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
You've been talking about the war.

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I'm in charge of the ship.

46
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
The ship has been loaded.

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Why do you say that?

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm afraid you'll have to go there for nothing.

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
So you're the one who loaded the ship.

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
So the person who picked it up

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
was a rumor.

52
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Exactly.

53
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I've been on board.

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
There's no cargo on the ship.

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I'll check it out.

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
If it's true,

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
I'll make sure you're sorry.

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Search!

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes!

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Wait!

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Mr. Lu, have you thought it through?

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Behind me

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
is Prince Ning.

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
You've been so rude today.

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Are you going to be enemies with Prince Ning?

66
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Liu Jun.

67
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Don't make things difficult for me.

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm in charge.

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
If the ship is really clean,

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I'll go to Prince Ning's house tomorrow

71
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
to ask for forgiveness.

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Search!

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Yes!

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
The fourth day has passed.

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Why did Mr. Lu suddenly board the ship?

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Your Majesty,

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Liu Jun's arrangement for the cargo

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
was very secretive.

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I don't know when it was revealed.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
They've all boarded the ship.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
And they said it was very secretive.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
If they find

83
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
what's on the ship,

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
the saint will definitely find out

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
that we're secretly setting up the weapons room.

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Your Majesty, don't worry.

87
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Liu Jun's plan is well thought out.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Although our cargo ship has been robbed,

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
our big plan

90
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
is not exposed.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Liu Jun!

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
What did you do?

93
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I...

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
You know your crime.

95
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
You know your crime.

96
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Tell me

97
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
what happened

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
to the statue

99
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
that was made of iron.

100
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
What did you do?

101
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I...

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I...

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I...

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I...

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Your Majesty,

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
my father used to be a fan of the ghost god.

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
And it was the Yujia Chiming

108
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
who died a few years ago.

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
After he was removed from the post,

110
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
he was ill and was praying for godly blessings.

111
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
So, he listened to his teacher

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
and invited 99 gods to his house

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
to heal.

114
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
The sinned god wasn't filial,

115
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
so he made his body

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
in the shape of a statue

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
for his father.

118
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
So,

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,960
So, I have to praise you for being a filial son?

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,240
To all the officials!

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,200
You've been working in the warehouse all the time.

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
The people saw it.

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Now the news is spreading everywhere.

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
What's wrong with my reputation?

125
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,640
You used your power to do illegal things.

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,200
Who dares to believe the officials?

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
Believe me!

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,960
Your Majesty, you're right.

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
As far as I know,

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
Minister Zheng has been working in the warehouse since he took office.

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
He's been transporting the tribute.

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,320
He's been selling a lot of foreign goods.

133
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
He's also been collecting bribes.

134
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,960
He's been covering up the evil.

135
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,600
So, the people are afraid to talk about it.

136
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,800
Minister Zheng, you dare to talk about bribes?

137
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,960
You have to investigate it.

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,840
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

139
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Your Majesty, I've known him for many years.

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
I know him very well.

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,640
I can't be suspicious of him.

142
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,680
There must be some misunderstanding.

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,040
I believe that Prince Ning will guarantee the safety of Minister Zheng.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
Of course I believe in him.

146
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
But what do you think

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,080
shouldn't be questioned?

148
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Liappe!

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
The centipede is amazing.

150
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,080
but you don't know how grateful you are.

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,560
You even used your power to kill yourself.

152
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,880
You deserve a severe punishment.

153
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,880
Please, Your Majesty,

154
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,080
dismiss him and send him away.

155
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
Brother,

156
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,280
this is your way of showing your respect.

157
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,680
I dare not

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,200
to care about private affairs.

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,400
On the contrary,

160
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,920
Liu Chang has failed me and my mistress.

161
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,240
He deserves a severe punishment.

162
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,840
No.

163
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,920
What a sad story!

164
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,720
Prince of Ning beat you even worse!

165
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,600
Liu Chang,

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,040
what do you want to say?

167
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,480
Look, his brother-in-law's varieties are getting worse怎

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
so, the grand garden-져 whatnot

169
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:46,020
would have to go to the

170
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,740
You've done a great job, Mr. Lu.

171
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,020
You'll be in charge of the transfer.

172
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,820
Take good care of it.

173
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,820
You must stop the corruption of the private sector.

174
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,900
I accept the order.

175
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,780
Come on.

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,300
Do you feel displeased?

177
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,140
No.

178
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,620
It's an order.

179
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,540
We don't want any promise of failure.

180
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,860
And I feel sorry for you.

181
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,980
I understand, sir.

182
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,980
You've done a great job.

183
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,180
Though the subirasлег öncek figure of Tung Tie is out of the rush,

184
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,180
many officials know about your father's travelers

185
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,140
who follow the diachallah ideas.

186
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,740
Therefore, I think you're right.

187
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,740
If you really found out the situation,

188
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
it would be a big trouble.

189
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,740
This case has caused a lot of confusion.

190
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
The businessmen feel that they have lost face,

191
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
so they ask for a thorough investigation.

192
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,740
But it's just the way it is.

193
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,740
When he has new fun in the future,

194
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,740
he will let go of this matter.

195
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,740
By then, I will have a chance to let you return to the court.

196
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Thank you for your advice.

197
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
You should be more careful with your work.

198
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,740
The military and military affairs are temporarily disbanded.

199
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
You should be more careful.

200
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Yes.

201
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
By the way,

202
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
since you are away from home,

203
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,740
it's good to spend more time with your master.

204
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
I understand.

205
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Okay, let's leave it here.

206
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Put the things away.

207
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Master He,

208
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,740
you have a lot of precious herbs in your shop.

209
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
Now the He family is in a bad situation,

210
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
I don't want to kill them.

211
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,740
But if you still can't pay the bill next May,

212
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,740
these two boxes won't be enough.

213
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Yes, yes.

214
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Thank you for your consideration.

215
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Your daughter is in a bad situation in Chang'an.

216
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I don't know how to respect you.

217
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,740
If I didn't see you crying in your home,

218
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I would have thought you were crying on purpose.

219
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
I'm leaving.

220
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,740
Goodbye, Master Ding.

221
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,740
Ding Tianzhu is so greedy.

222
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
He gave me two boxes of calligraphy.

223
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
I gave it to him for free.

224
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
He didn't say he would give me more.

225
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,740
How can I pay the bill next May?

226
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Ma'er, what's wrong?

227
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
What's wrong, Ma'er?

228
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
You are injured again.

229
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
Ma'er,

230
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
you can't go back to your home.

231
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
I can't go back to my home.

233
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,740
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,740
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Ma'er, why did you drop the plate?

242
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,740
It's not tasty.

243
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,740
If it's not tasty, then don't eat it.

244
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
I'll make you a new one.

245
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Everything is not tasty.

246
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I want to eat the snacks from the Bifang House.

247
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
Okay, okay.

248
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
I'll ask someone to buy it for you.

249
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
What do you want to buy?

250
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Now everyone in the house is against food.

251
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
You are the best.

252
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Do you think you are a father?

253
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Why are you telling him this?

254
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
He is still a child.

255
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,740
How can he understand this?

256
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
He is still a child.

257
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
When I was his age,

258
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I was able to calculate the accounts

259
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
without any trouble.

260
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I was never bothered.

261
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Then why are you saying this?

262
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
No matter how good he is,

263
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
he should think about you.

264
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Since he went to Chang'an,

265
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,740
he has been borrowing some family books.

266
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Does he want to come back and visit his relatives?

267
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
He is the head of the flower business.

268
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
He is using the mountains in the square.

269
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Does he want to come back

270
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,740
and help us?

271
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
He wants to help us.

272
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
That square

273
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
was left by his mother.

274
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Back then,

275
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
we sold the garden for business.

276
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
We were sorry for her.

277
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
She suffered a lot in Chang'an.

278
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Now,

279
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
she has become a flower shop owner

280
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
with her own skills.

281
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
How can she

282
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
ask for help?

283
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
She is a woman of honor.

284
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
You two know that.

285
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Is she a good woman

286
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
or a good doctor?

287
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Look at

288
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
our family.

289
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
We have been defeated.

290
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
If he is a good man,

291
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,740
he should come back

292
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
with a thousand books

293
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
to apologize to us.

294
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
You...

295
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
You are unreasonable!

296
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Mother,

297
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
why is father so angry?

298
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
It has nothing to do with you.

299
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Your father is a sister in the family.

300
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,740
He is not loyal.

301
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,740
What's the use of being angry?

302
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
My sister is from the He family.

303
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,740
If she does something wrong, she will be punished.

304
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
She is not from the He family.

305
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
You are right.

306
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
You are right.

307
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
Your sister

308
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
is from the He family.

309
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
She should not be

310
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
separated from us.

311
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Let's go.

312
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
I will take you to eat some snacks.

313
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Let's go.

314
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Let's go.

315
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Let's go.

316
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
Let's go.

317
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Let's go.

318
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Let's go.

319
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Let's go.

320
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Let's go.

321
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Where is this?

322
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
This is our

323
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
future brother.

324
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Mother.

325
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
Come.

326
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
How is father?

327
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
He is fine.

328
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Seeing you

329
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
in Chang'an,

330
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
I am very glad.

331
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Your father is in Luoyang

332
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
missing you.

333
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
He asked me

334
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
to bring you these pancakes.

335
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Why did he not come personally?

336
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
You do not know.

337
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
The He family

338
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
has been losing

339
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
for a year.

340
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Now

341
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
they are all gone.

342
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Your father is

343
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
running around

344
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
to pay the debt.

345
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
How can he still be alive?

346
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
How could this happen?

347
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
Father

348
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
was a merchant.

349
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
How could he be in such a situation?

350
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
You are not a fool.

351
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
You and Liu Chang

352
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
were so close

353
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
that the He family

354
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
did not support you.

355
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Later you escaped from the Liu family.

356
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Everyone thought you were dead.

357
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
The Liu family

358
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
did not help us.

359
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,740
They made it difficult for us.

360
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,740
We could not get through.

361
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
The others

362
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
were just like you.

363
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,740
How could we do business?

364
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Mu Dan

365
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
you are

366
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
so happy

367
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
because of the whole

368
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
He family.

369
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,740
I understand.

370
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
I will pack up the stuff

371
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
and go back to Luoyang

372
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
to discuss with my father.

373
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
You...

374
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
You know your father's temper.

375
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
He did not want to see you

376
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,740
so he asked me to come to you.

377
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
Even if you go back

378
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
he will not see you.

379
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,740
But if I do not go back

380
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,740
how can I help

381
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
my father to do business?

382
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,740
You are right.

383
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,740
You two

384
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I know you care about each other.

385
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Your father

386
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
is always talking about you

387
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
in the family.

388
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,740
He feels guilty.

389
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
And you...

390
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
When Man Er was a kid

391
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,740
you helped him

392
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
to settle the accounts.

393
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Now my father is in trouble.

394
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Even if he does not see me

395
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
I will not leave him alone.

396
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
I will send someone to

397
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
take care of the jade and silk.

398
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
You can take it back.

399
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
I will contact

400
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,740
the medicine shop in Chang'an

401
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,740
and find a way to get it back.

402
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
So that my father can do business again.

403
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
Good.

404
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
You are so filial.

405
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I am glad.

406
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
But the way you said

407
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,740
he cannot solve

408
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,740
the problem of the He family.

409
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
What do you mean?

410
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I have been with your father

411
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,740
for so many years.

412
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
I know a little about business.

413
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
Why do you keep it from me?

414
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
No one knows about Chang'an.

415
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
The square

416
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,740
is the foundation of your body.

417
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
It was not my father

418
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
who asked you to come.

419
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Why do you say that?

420
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
It was your father

421
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
who asked me to come.

422
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
I know my father's character.

423
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
He loves me very much.

424
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
The square is what my mother cherished the most.

425
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
How could my father

426
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
ask me to come?

427
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
You came to Chang'an

428
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
without telling your father.

429
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,740
You are so kind.

430
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,740
But it is a pity

431
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
that you cannot get a single cent from me.

432
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
You cannot get the square.

433
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,740
Guards!

434
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
Send the guest out.

435
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Please.

436
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Mudan, you misunderstood.

437
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
Mudan,

438
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,740
the He family needs your help.

439
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Look at Ma'er.

440
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Look at your brother.

441
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
He is still young.

442
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Do you want to see him

443
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
suffer from hunger and hunger with us?

444
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
You are so rude.

445
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
I don't want to see you.

446
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
Don't say that.

447
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Father,

448
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
I am right.

449
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
When I was eight,

450
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
I went to the shop with him.

451
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
He was faster than Mr. Zhang Fang.

452
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,740
If your son could do that,

453
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
he would not let you suffer from hunger and hunger.

454
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
After all,

455
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,740
he is loyal and filial.

456
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
He is a good man.

457
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
Ma'er is

458
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
your father's only child.

459
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
He will inherit

460
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
the He family business.

461
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
You are so biased against him.

462
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
When he becomes

463
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
the He family's owner,

464
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
you will kneel and kowtow

465
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
to him.

466
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
What a joke!

467
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,740
I have built my own family.

468
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,740
What does it have to do with me?

469
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
The one standing in front of you

470
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
is the owner of the shop.

471
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,740
You want him to kneel?

472
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Look at the words on the wall.

473
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
It was written by the merchant himself.

474
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
I advise you to be polite.

475
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
You are a little whore.

476
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Whom are you talking about?

477
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
We are not whores.

478
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
If you don't leave,

479
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,740
I will not be polite.

480
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,740
He Weifang,

481
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
are you being cheated?

482
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
If you didn't take away

483
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,740
a precious peony from the He family

484
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,740
when you fled,

485
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
you would be a whore.

486
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
What?

487
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
You are crazy now?

488
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
You want to turn a blind eye?

489
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
I am telling you,

490
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
you should have

491
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
the He family's share

492
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
of the wealth

493
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
you have now.

494
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I started my family in Chang'an

495
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
and prayed for the disaster.

496
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
I never begged anyone of you.

497
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Now,

498
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
you want to share the burden?

499
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
You are the one who is the most important.

500
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
He left me the peony.

501
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I will discuss with him

502
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
if he is in trouble.

503
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
But it has nothing to do with you.

504
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
Guards, send the guest away.

505
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I won't leave.

506
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Don't touch me.

507
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Don't touch me.

508
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
He Weifang's mother is not sick.

509
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Wait.

510
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,740
What did you say?

511
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
Your mother

512
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
was not infected with the disease.

513
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,740
She was poisoned.

514
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,740
Go.

515
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Go.

516
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
Go on.

517
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
The person who poisoned her

518
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
is her enemy.

519
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
The poison is incurable.

520
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Only the Zixi Pellet can test it.

521
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
That's why your father

522
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,740
went to find the poison.

523
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
Do you think I will believe

524
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
your words?

525
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
Your mother

526
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
was a good person.

527
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
She was good at all things.

528
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,740
How can she be her enemy?

529
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,740
You don't know the truth.

530
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,740
She is not only her enemy.

531
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,740
Lord Qian hates her.

532
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
She knows she is guilty.

533
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
That's why

534
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,740
she didn't tell you.

535
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
Think about it.

536
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
What kind of evil

537
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
will happen suddenly?

538
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,740
You will be in trouble

539
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
in a few months.

540
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
You have been in contact with the medicine since you were a child.

541
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Have you ever seen

542
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
such a strange disease?

543
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,740
How can you prove that you are telling the truth?

544
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,740
I know who he is.

545
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Give me five thousand pages of paper.

546
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
I will tell you his name.

547
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,740
You will know

548
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,740
if it's true or not.

549
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Okay.

550
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I promise you.

551
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Wu Hong is from Luoyang.

552
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,740
He was a servant of a lady in Chang'an.

553
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
He went back to his hometown to visit his family a few years ago.

554
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,740
It was during the time when Mrs. He was sick.

555
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,740
The time is right.

556
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,740
Before he went back to Luoyang to visit his family,

557
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,740
he lived in Chang'an.

558
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
He should have no grudges with his mother.

559
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
Why did he hurt his mother?

560
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
I didn't find out.

561
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,740
But he is very strange.

562
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
He went back to Chang'an and disappeared for a while.

563
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,740
He even changed his name and left the city.

564
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
If he didn't have a ghost in his heart,

565
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,740
why would he do that?

566
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Where is he now?

567
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
What is he doing?

568
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
He is managing a nursing home outside the city.

569
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,740
He is not strange.

570
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Everyone around him praises him.

571
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
He is kind and kind.

572
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
He is very kind to children.

573
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
Do you have his portrait?

574
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
I don't have.

575
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
I don't have.

576
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
I don't have.

577
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
I don't have.

578
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I don't have.

579
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
I don't have.

580
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
Where is he?

581
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
He is in the city.

582
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,740
He has gone to the city.

583
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
It's cold outside.

584
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Come in and warm yourself.

585
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,740
No need.

586
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,740
I have something to ask you.

587
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
Please come out.

588
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,740
A Kang,

589
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,740
take them to the ship.

590
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
Okay.

591
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
I will go.

592
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Your name is Wu Hong.

593
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,740
Is that right?

594
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Yes.

595
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
Do you know

596
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
the owner of the drugstore in Luoyang He?

597
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
I do.

598
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
You killed my mother.

599
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Right?

600
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,740
It was me.

601
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,740
Why?

602
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
That year

603
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
I died

604
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
not only because of your mother.

605
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
I was also killed

606
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
by my mother.

607
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
That year

608
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
I found out that

609
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
my family was in a flood.

610
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
So I hurried back to Luoyang.

611
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
I was very worried.

612
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
I watched

613
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
my parents

614
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
and my wife and children

615
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
die in front of me.

616
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Did you ever

617
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
feel the despair

618
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
of thousands of people?

619
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
What does it have to do with my mother?

620
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
The water was destroyed

621
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
by our poor family.

622
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
The disease was destroyed

623
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
by our poor family.

624
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
The officials

625
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
and the rich

626
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
were all hiding in the house.

627
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
They were not afraid of money

628
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
and we were not.

629
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
We

630
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
could only wait

631
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
for death.

632
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
How could I not hate it?

633
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Do you know

634
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
the last person

635
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,740
who died in my arms

636
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
was my

637
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
first child.

638
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
He had big eyes

639
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
and could not die.

640
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I hated him

641
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
and I was afraid of him.

642
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
I wanted to find someone

643
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
to bury my family.

644
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
But I could not enter

645
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
the house of the rich.

646
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
I wandered around

647
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
and finally found a chance

648
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
to enter a house.

649
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Your mother

650
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
was not a farmer

651
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
who gave them food.

652
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I told her

653
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
that my family had died

654
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
and had no money to bury them.

655
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
I found this job

656
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
and she gave me two pieces of money.

657
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
I did not need her body

658
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,740
or her money.

659
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,740
I just wanted

660
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
to bury my family.

661
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,740
The division was finalized.

662
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
How could I not

663
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,740
do it?

664
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,040
Iillions

665
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
have beenλι limit

666
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,740
I've never hurt a single person.

667
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
But your family is happy.

668
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,740
But I've destroyed my family.

669
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Why should I blame you?

670
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,740
You can only blame your mother for her misfortune.

671
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,740
Your mother was so unhappy

672
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,740
that you ruined her chance.

673
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
It's you who didn't want to part.

674
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,740
I am not guilty.

675
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,740
Since you've found me,

676
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,740
it's my fate.

677
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,740
I'll kill you.

678
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
I'll kill you.

679
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
I'll kill you.

680
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Wu Dan.

681
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
Zui Zhi.

682
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
It's a private matter.

683
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
What's the point of killing Wu Bo?

684
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
You know...

685
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Why did you lie to me?

686
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Why did you lie to me?

687
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,740
When will you stop blaming me?

688
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Even if you kill her,

689
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,740
your mother will not come back.

690
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
Jiang Chaoyang.

691
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,740
We are both lost mothers.

692
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,740
I thought you were my friend.

693
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,740
I thought you were my friend.

694
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,740
Get out of my way.

695
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,740
I said, get out of my way!

696
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Zui Zhi!

697
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Are you crazy?

698
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Are you crazy, Mo Jiang Chaoyang?

699
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,740
Let the past be the past.

700
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,740
Wu Bo is also a poor man.

701
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Wu Dan.

702
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,740
Let it go.

703
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,740
Poor man?

704
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Isn't my mother a poor man?

705
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,740
My mother values me.

706
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,740
She told me to be a good servant.

707
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Especially Wu Bo.

708
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
These years,

709
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Wu Bo has been suffering.

710
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,740
He has been paying for his sins.

711
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Paying for his sins?

712
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,740
Can he make my mother come back to life?

713
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Can he change the fact that he is the murderer?

714
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
My mother was a good person.

715
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,740
She made so many medicine bags.

716
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,740
She sent them to the victims of her illness.

717
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Now the murderer who killed my mother is here.

718
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,740
But you told me to let it go.

719
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,740
I can't let it go.

720
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,740
I can't let it go!

721
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Zui Zhi!

722
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
These years,

723
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Wu Bo watched me grow up.

724
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
He accompanied me to send my mother away.

725
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Now he is like my family.

726
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,740
I can't let you hurt him.

727
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Little lady.

728
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Wu Bo!

729
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,740
Don't say that.

730
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Jia Chang Yang.

731
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Now I know

732
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,740
you are a person who is unchangeable.

733
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
You are a person who is unchangeable.

734
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,740
I was wrong about you.

735
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,740
The city is full of wishes

736
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Why do you have to leave?

737
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,740
I don't want to remember

738
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,740
I don't want to leave

739
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,740
The flowers are in full bloom

740
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,740
The heart is silent

741
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,740
I only wish to grow up

742
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:35,740
To bloom and grow up with you

743
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,740
The flowers are in full bloom

744
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,740
The heart is silent

745
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I only wish to grow up

746
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,740
To bloom and grow up with you

747
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,740
I only wish to grow up

748
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,740
To bloom and grow up with you

749
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
With you

750
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,740
With you

751
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
Mister.

752
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Little lady has left the house.

753
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Bye bye.

754
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,740
Mother.

755
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,740
The pharmacy is definitely short of people.

756
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,740
I want to help.

757
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
After the flood,

758
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
there are many people in the city.

759
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Your father told us not to go out these days.

760
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
But there are so many sick people.

761
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
There must be someone to take care of.

762
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,740
But I feel very uneasy to hide in the house.

763
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,740
Now there are many patients and few medicines.

764
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,740
If you get sick and take more medicines,

765
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,740
then other patients will be less.

766
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,740
Besides, we have to pay for the medicine.

767
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
It's also a benefit for the people who are sick.

768
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
Mother is right.

769
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,740
Mother, is the disease so fierce this time?

770
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,740
Usually, we just need to use ordinary peonies.

771
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,740
This time we use ice crystal peonies.

772
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,740
The flowers in the yard are almost all picked up.

773
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,740
The skin of this flower can cool the cold blood and relieve the pain of the pig.

774
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
It can be used to treat the mother, the mother-in-law, the baby, the baby.

775
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,740
It can relieve the heat of the lungs.

776
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,740
It is the most necessary medicine for this purpose.

777
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,740
The ice crystal peonies we plant are very rare.

778
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,740
They are the most expensive.

779
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,740
When the disaster happened, a pearl was worth a thousand jin.

780
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Mother, you give such a valuable medicine to the people who are sick.

781
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Mother is so kind.

782
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,740
The clouds in the sky are printed on the medicine bag.

783
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
It also has the meaning of prayer.

784
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:33,740
I hope that all the people who want this medicine can be healthy and safely through this disaster.

785
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,740
I will definitely do it.

786
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,740
The moon is shining.

787
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
The moon is shining.

788
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,740
The moon is shining.

789
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,740
The moon is shining.

790
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,740
The moon is shining.

791
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,740
The moon is shining.

792
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,740
The moon is shining.

793
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,740
The moon is shining.

794
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,740
The moon is shining.

795
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,740
The moon is shining.

796
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,740
The moon is shining.

797
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,740
The moon is shining.

798
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,740
The moon is shining.

799
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,740
The moon is shining.

800
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,740
The moon is shining.

801
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
The moon is shining.

802
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,740
The moon is shining.

803
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,740
The moon is shining.

804
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,740
The moon is shining.

805
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,740
The moon is shining.

806
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,740
The moon is shining.

807
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,740
The moon is shining.

808
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,740
The moon is shining.

809
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,740
The moon is shining.

810
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
The moon is shining.

811
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
The moon is shining.

812
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,740
The moon is shining.

813
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,740
