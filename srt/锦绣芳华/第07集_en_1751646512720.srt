Yup

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That is our place

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,000
What's happening

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Are you Jiang Zuo Jian from the palace?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,440
Is the Jiang Mansion going to have a meal?

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Yes.

22
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,640
Lady Xiao likes the pavilion.

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,360
Her Highness sent us here to have a look.

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
She said she would dig up the two shabby houses

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
next to the garden

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
and build a water pavilion for Lady Xiao.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
This is the mansion of the flower bird.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,720
It's not her house.

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,440
What's going on in the Jiang Mansion?

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,200
They are both from the same family.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
And they are both under the same roof.

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,160
Since they sent us here,

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,280
I think we should go.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
Excuse us.

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
It seems that our house is going to be a water pavilion.

36
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,880
Mudan, stop digging.

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,640
It's a big deal.

38
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,000
Go and ask Jiang Changyang.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Sister, it's okay.

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,440
We'll go back to the garden.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
There are many houses in the garden.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,680
It's not a beautiful view.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,000
And I...

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm fine.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Don't worry.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,240
I'll ask them after they finish their birthday.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,120
Let's finish these things first.

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,720
Go.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
They paid us.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
Hurry up.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
Sister, you're so good at it.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,360
Let's go.

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,280
Wait.

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,600
Dad.

55
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Zhezhe.

57
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900

58
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,500

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,620

61
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,200

62
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,180
go

63
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,260
co

64
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
u

65
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,400
Why should I do this to an inhaler?

66
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
It doesn't cost me.

67
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,240
Everyone needs one.

68
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
Oh dear!

69
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,000
I have to bibantize new books!

70
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Some spécializing letters have arrived.

71
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,360
Let's go, let's check.

72
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
If I can get you anything else,

73
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,900
But I've always been fond of you.

74
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I thought we would never meet again.

75
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
I've lost my hope.

76
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,900
But who knew I'd meet you again in Chang'an?

77
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,900
I've thought about following my parents' orders and living with them.

78
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,900
But the closer I get to others, the more I realize I can't do it.

79
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,900
You've always been the one in my heart.

80
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
You've always been the one in my heart.

81
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I've always wanted a daughter.

82
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I treated you like a daughter.

83
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,900
I've always treated you as my own daughter.

84
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I know you don't love me.

85
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,900
But if you want to marry me, I'd rather marry you.

86
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,900
We haven't met for years, but we're old friends.

87
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,900
I feel at ease when I'm with you.

88
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I believe you feel the same way.

89
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Suizhi, you'll marry me sooner or later.

90
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm the most suspicious person.

91
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Xuexi, I'll always be your brother.

92
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,900
But I won't marry you.

93
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
I don't want to ruin your happiness.

94
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I'll drink to you.

95
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
I wish you a happy birthday.

96
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
I hope you'll find someone who loves you.

97
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,900
You'll be together forever.

98
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
I've told you many times.

99
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
You can't control my family.

100
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
You can't rebuild the back yard.

101
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Young Master Jiang, you're doing this for me.

102
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,900
I can't go back to work.

103
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Young Master, please.

104
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

105
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Young Master, please.

106
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm sorry for the old friend.

107
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I'll go to Li's Mansion today.

108
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,900
I'll come back and live with you.

109
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Yes, thank you.

110
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Goodbye.

111
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
You're leaving?

112
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
It's rare to come to Chang'an.

113
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
I want to go around.

114
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,900
I want to see the famous temple and the hot spring.

115
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,900
It's better than being trapped in the four-way house.

116
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
I don't want to be an extra person.

117
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Suizhi, I'm sorry.

118
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
I'm sorry.

119
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Suizhi, I hope you can prove your feelings.

120
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't miss it.

121
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Suizhi, I'm sorry.

122
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
I'm sorry.

123
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Once upon a time

124
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,680
There lived a Levitan freed a horse

125
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,900
To a promotion by his family

126
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Lifted his sword towardsations

127
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,460
We're ready.

128
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,840
rol

129
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,500
Did you go out any more?

130
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,540
No.

131
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Don't worry, we are each other.

132
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
I will never let you be in a dilemma.

133
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,540
And I will never make you fight for your love.

134
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

135
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
You like Suizhi.

136
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
Jingxiu Fanghua

137
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Xuexi

138
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Don't get me wrong.

139
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,540
Jiang Changyang and I are just partners.

140
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
There is nothing else.

141
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I just bought some beans and incense.

142
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
You can use it when you make soup.

143
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
Before you go out, go pick some flowers.

144
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
I'll send you.

145
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Okay, let's go.

146
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
Duan Zanshi

147
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I should understand his feelings when I received Duan Zanshi.

148
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
But I think that young lady treats him very well.

149
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
She thinks I'm her confidante.

150
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,540
She didn't say it clearly.

151
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,540
She is afraid that she will never be able to live as freely as before.

152
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Why should I bother her?

153
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Duan Zanshi

154
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Duan Zanshi

155
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
You're here.

156
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
Sit down.

157
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm so tired.

158
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Why am I running so much?

159
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Why am I running so many hours?

160
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
I overate.

161
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
So I don't have any appetite.

162
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
I had some iары.

163
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Ay exit

164
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
The last snack

165
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,540
should be something simple.

166
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,140
And schlek then

167
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,480
I think it's técn�

168
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,980
We are here

169
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,300
To say you're back

170
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,220
She'd be looking at your shrimps,

171
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,820
wondering if Anya was there or not.

172
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,540
When you married someone,

173
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,100
Let's go find him.

174
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,860
Yeah.

175
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,740
Okay.

176
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,260
Guys, promise me that...

177
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,920
...you will do whatever I say!

178
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,780
It is special.

179
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,540
Like punishment.

180
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,980
Then how can I help you?

181
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Whatever you need.

182
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,580
Okay.

183
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:34,540
The flowers never bloom, but for you, but for me.

184
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Jiang Changyang, I'm afraid you're going to lose.

185
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:36,540
Jiang Changyang, I'll return this moon to you.

186
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:04,540
The oil merchants in Tongxi Yu said that this is the black oil produced by Tuho Luo.

187
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,540
This kind of oil is very strong and is used in the battlefield.

188
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,540
There are no such things in Chang'an.

189
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Ordinary people can't afford it.

190
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Since it's used in the battlefield, it's a forbidden thing.

191
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,540
It's not common for ordinary people to get it.

192
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,540
But we haven't offended any officials recently.

193
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I remember.

194
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,540
A few days ago, Liu Chang came to the square and bought a few boxes of clothes.

195
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,540
I think he's been fooling Li Youzhen again.

196
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
It's him again.

197
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Is he finished?

198
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,540
He's a rich county, how can he do harm to people all day?

199
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,540
The box of goods sent that day was hit by a water beast.

200
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,540
I heard that recently there was a group of water bandits who were in Chang'an.

201
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,540
They just had to pay for it.

202
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,540
We can start with this and catch the murderer of the fire.

203
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Anyway, this time I must make Li Youzhen confess.

204
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:48,760
That day, I was with

205
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Da Fu told me that you have written your letter of resignation.

206
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,960
You can send it to the square.

207
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
No need to see me again.

208
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,160
General.

209
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
The bandits were caught so quickly.

210
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,920
When I went there, someone set a trap.

211
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
I let go of my hand.

212
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,840
The bandits are in the backyard.

213
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,360
We couldn't simply release confident andOS-fahrtìe simply because we've grabbed their hands.

214
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Unfortunately,it's not easy for contractors to Heights Boats simply to release their hands

215
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
They are supposed to allow the enemy to make a chance

216
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,080
within the Ready to sing station.

217
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,880
I don't think you know

218
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,120
that we won't get away with it just because

219
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
we prepared our Tamil escapes.

220
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
So let's not get ahead of ourselves.

221
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Is there any other way?

222
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,120
If you are willing to be the witness

223
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
and the mastermind behind the scenes

224
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I can be the victim

225
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,120
and help you to reduce your punishment

226
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Let the judge

227
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
or the maid of the flower house

228
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
The means of the fish

229
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
will make them cooperate with each other

230
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Our peony is hurt

231
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
There is no wine here

232
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I can only think of you

233
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
You!

234
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Don't worry, my lady

235
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
You need to take some medicine

236
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
It will make you feel better

237
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Thank you for your kindness, General

238
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
But I'll find out about it myself

239
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
You have helped me a lot

240
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
I can't bother you anymore

241
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
General, let's go

242
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Go, go

243
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I didn't expect

244
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
you would take me to the water

245
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
You live in the capital

246
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,120
How can you know the reason for the fire?

247
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
There is only one possibility

248
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
for him to get it

249
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Prince Ning

250
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
You came for Prince Ning

251
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Prince Ning has a lot of military supplies

252
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
He is a big man

253
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
He will get involved in the case

254
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
if he is not careful

255
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Leave him to me

256
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
I can leave him to you

257
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
But the reason is to kill me alone

258
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I don't want to die in the whole area

259
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
I don't want so many innocent people to get hurt

260
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
The most serious injury in the world

261
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
can't be cured

262
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
I have to explain to you

263
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
how I feel

264
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
after the bloodshed

265
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
in the morning and in the evening

266
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Even if there are people

267
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
who can't be bothered

268
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
you still decide to take revenge

269
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Yes

270
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
I have the witness

271
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
As for the evidence

272
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I think you have found

273
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
where the other fire is

274
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
You think you can make the county

275
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
admit the crime by finding the fire?

276
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
As long as Prince Ning is here

277
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
he will be safe

278
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,120
He is the royal family

279
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
I am the valley

280
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
So all the way

281
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
I have been begging for help

282
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
But this time

283
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
he burned not only

284
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
my yard but also everyone's house

285
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
No matter who took the evidence

286
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
to knock on the Deng Wengu and report to the county

287
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
or the county's right-hand man killed himself

288
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
I have to make his actions

289
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,120
pay the price

290
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Even if I have to kill myself

291
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I have no regrets

292
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
I knew

293
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
you would make this choice

294
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,120
So you are not here to stop me

295
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
You want to kill Li Youzhen?

296
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I want to kill Prince Ning

297
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Actually our purpose

298
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
is the same

299
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
If so

300
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
we will do it like Su Min

301
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Let's cooperate again

302
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Prince Ning's private warehouse

303
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
is in the east of the city

304
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
It is a safe place

305
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,120
and it is hidden from the public

306
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,120
There are weapons and oil

307
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
in the private warehouse

308
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
It is hard to sneak in

309
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
But

310
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
I have already installed

311
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
my own people in the private warehouse

312
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
It is good to use now

313
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Yes

314
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Stand up

315
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Slow down

316
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Wait

317
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Officer

318
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I have checked

319
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Checked

320
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Checked

321
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Those soldiers

322
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
are better than the previous ones

323
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Yes

324
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Good

325
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,880
Commander, these are specialty knapps. They are very valuable.

326
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,140
Be careful.

327
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,840
Avonus has been destroyed.

328
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,160
We leap into Class 1, trying to silver plated, but it defaults.

329
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Yes, they are the best.

330
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,720
I wonder when can I use them.

331
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,680
terminate!

332
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I see

333
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,000
I won't raise an impact

334
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:36,820
As they say, if you are not from the

335
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,860
Why are you in this clothes?

336
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
Wait a minute.

337
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,440
What's wrong?

338
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,580
My hands noticed person.

339
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,840
It's dangerous out here.

340
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,660
There're crime in the room.

341
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Don't you come here,

342
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,260
or they might hurt our lives.

343
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,980
Thank you

344
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,420
The defense of the room is in exchange.

345
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,060
We have three boxes of time.

346
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,700
There are more than a hundred warehouse in the warehouse.

347
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,020
We need to act separately.

348
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
The defense of the room is in exchange.

349
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,260
We have three boxes of time.

350
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
We need to act separately.

351
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
We need to act separately.

352
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260
We have three boxes of time.

353
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
We need to act separately.

354
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260
We have three boxes of time.

355
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
We need to act separately.

356
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
We have three boxes of time.

357
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
We need to act separately.

358
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
We have three boxes of time.

359
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
We need to act separately.

360
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
We have three boxes of time.

361
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
We need to act separately.

362
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
That's the upper door.

363
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
The fire is still in there.

364
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Only here is the water tank.

365
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Let's go.

366
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
You're afraid of fire?

367
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Let me do it.

368
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
I'm fine.

369
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Okay.

370
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Let's go.

371
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
You're not afraid of fire?

372
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
A good man can't be a good man.

373
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Why are you so afraid of fire?

374
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
I'm afraid of fire.

375
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Why do you need fire?

376
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
I'm afraid of fire.

377
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Then let's go.

378
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Go.

379
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Let's go.

380
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
I'm afraid of fire.

381
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm afraid of fire.

382
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Let's go.

383
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Go.

384
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Let's go.

385
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Let's go.

386
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
I'm coming.

387
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Your Majesty!

388
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Your Majesty!

389
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,260
Mr. Huang.

390
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,260
Your Majesty, the court is in a mess today.

391
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Last night, His Majesty was walking in the water.

392
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,260
He was burnt for a night, and then he died.

393
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,260
The people were terrified.

394
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,260
They gathered at the gate of the Palace of the Great Zhao.

395
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
The Ministry of Revenue sent people to check.

396
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,260
The Palace of Revenue is a big and rich private bank.

397
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
People can get burnt there.

398
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Your Majesty, although it's for the people,

399
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,260
the fire has been burning for a month.

400
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,260
People are worried that the fire in the city will not be strong enough

401
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,260
and they are afraid that one day they will burn their own house.

402
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
People are in a hurry.

403
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
The house is not lively.

404
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
The people are so busy.

405
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,260
It's my fault.

406
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
I should have told you earlier.

407
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,260
But I gave too much.

408
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,260
Let people do what they want.

409
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,260
Your Majesty, this is...

410
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,260
This is also about the mistress of the Flower and Bird Division.

411
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,260
The mistress of the Flower and Bird Division also went to the Palace of Revenue.

412
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,260
She said that the fire was her house.

413
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,260
In addition, Consort Shu sent people to spread rumors.

414
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,260
She said that all the famous sachets in the Square were burnt.

415
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,260
She ordered the people to check.

416
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,260
Did you also check?

417
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Yes.

418
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Your Majesty,

419
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,260
my house was not a big deal.

420
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,260
But the courtiers' house and the Royal Treasury were all damaged.

421
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
And Consort Shu's house was destroyed.

422
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
What a coincidence!

423
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Did someone dissatisfied the royal family?

424
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
If we don't check,

425
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,260
we don't know what happened to the fire.

426
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
You want to burn my house?

427
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,260
Call someone to check.

428
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,260
I'll do it myself.

429
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Yes.

430
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Your Majesty, the Marquis of Wu went immediately.

431
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
Yes, but some of the special goods in the warehouse

432
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
were not destroyed.

433
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,260
So the people were in a hurry.

434
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,260
What goods can be burned for a whole night?

435
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:41,600
It's not a

436
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,260
There is no lie in the Book of People.

437
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
The fire is not extinguished.

438
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,260
It's just a black fire.

439
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Why is there such a forbidden thing in the Royal Treasury?

440
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,260
I accidentally found a merchant who was smuggling the oil.

441
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,260
So I took it.

442
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I thought I'd stay in the Treasury for a while.

443
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I'll inform the Ministry of Revenue.

444
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,260
I didn't expect the Marquis of Wu to be so reckless.

445
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
How could this happen?

446
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I hope you find the right time.

447
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

448
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
Get up.

449
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

450
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Is the black fire all burnt?

451
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Not yet.

452
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,260
I took the Marquis of Wu to rescue the right time.

453
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,260
But the Marquis of Wu protected the Marquis of Wu.

454
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Take the people to the Treasury.

455
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
Don't ask the Emperor to send them.

456
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,260
The King is sure that all the oil is in the Treasury.

458
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,260
It never leaked.

459
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,260
If it falls into the hands of someone,

460
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I'm afraid...

461
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Yes, yes, yes, Brother.

462
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I thought that there was such a fierce thing in the city.

463
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,260
How can I sleep in peace?

464
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

465
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm a private guard.

466
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,260
I'm not a stranger.

467
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,260
The people of the city can sleep in peace.

468
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,260
If so, why is the oil in the Treasury...

469
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,260
...poured on the black fire?

470
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,260
I think we haven't seen this oil.

471
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,260
How can we tell that the oil was burnt?

472
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm not sure.

473
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,260
But the smell of the oil is exactly the same as I smelled in the Square.

474
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Your garden was burnt.

475
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,260
It's impossible to find the oil.

476
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Your garden was burnt.

477
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,260
It's not an accident.

478
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,260
How can it be related to the fire oil?

479
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
What's going on?

480
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Your Majesty.

481
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Someone sent a gift to the Garden.

482
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,260
I didn't expect that there was a fire oil in the box.

483
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
That's why the Garden was burnt.

484
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Mudan was sad.

485
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
She cried with me all day.

486
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
She didn't even want to run the shop.

487
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,260
She's my sweetheart.

488
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,260
She's my ex-boyfriend.

489
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,260
If this goes on, I'll lose my job.

490
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,260
The people of the city can't find the person who set the fire.

491
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
I have to find it myself.

492
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,260
I caught some bandits who set the fire.

493
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,260
They admitted that the oil was used to pour on the black fire.

494
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
The fire is not a fire oil.

495
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
I'm a private guard.

496
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
I work three shifts a day.

497
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,260
How can these bandits sneak in and steal?

498
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Besides, I thought someone had reported the missing.

499
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,260
I think the bandits are lying.

500
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
The fire oil is rare.

501
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I hid it before I set the fire.

502
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
I'll bring them up.

503
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,260
The fire oil will be clear when they are compared.

504
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
The fire oil is rare.

505
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
I'll bring them up.

506
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
The fire oil is rare.

507
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
I'll bring them up.

508
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
The fire oil is rare.

509
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,260
I'll bring them up.

510
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
The fire oil is rare.

511
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
I'll bring them up.

512
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
The fire oil is rare.

513
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
I'll bring them up.

514
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
The fire oil is rare.

515
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
I'll bring them up.

516
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260

I'll bring them up.

518
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,260

I'll bring them up.

520
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,260

I'll bring them up.

522
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,260
The fire oil is rare.

523
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
I'll bring them up.

524
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
The fire oil is rare.

525
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
I'll bring them up.

526
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
The fire oil is rare.

527
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I'll bring them up.

00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,260

I'll bring them up.

I'll bring them up.

I'll bring them up.

I'll bring them up.
