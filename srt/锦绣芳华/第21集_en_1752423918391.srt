For the love of your life.

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,760
Love it Can be etc.

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
Having patience

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:21,160
To invite the bubbles

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
And now, in the rain outside the window,

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
a lot of workers are already standing here.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
As long as I drink,

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
I will shoot arrows and break through the window.

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
The person I want to kill is Liu Chang.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
As long as you leave,

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I won't involve the innocent.

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
You think I will believe you?

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Master Liu,

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
our people are all on the streets.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
The market is surrounded by the city.

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
But there is no blood.

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Bullshit.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Fine.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Since you want to stay and die with Liu Chang,

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
I will help you.

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Wait.

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Master Liu,

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
this is not the order of the king.

38
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
We can't die here without a reason.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Please forgive us.

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Let's go.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
Tell me.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
I'll see if you dare.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Liu Chang,

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
it seems you are really not afraid of death.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
If what you said is true,

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
I can't escape death today.

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Why not die with you?

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Even if I die underground,

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
I won't let you and Jiang Changyang live well.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
But if you are a fake,

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,160
I have to think about how to change your fate.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Liu Chang,

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
do you think I dare not kill you?

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Your legs are broken.

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Your heart is broken too.

56
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Now you are different from the king of Ning.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
You are a bad man.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
You are a bad man.

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
You are a bad man.

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
So what?

61
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
So what?

62
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Kou Weifeng,

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I won.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
You are the one who was asked.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
And I didn't hear the Jiang Changyang in the mud.

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
I gave you a chance.

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Don't force me.

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Liu Chang,

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
do you think you won?

70
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,160
You wanted to get away from me.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
But in the end,

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
you are just a dog with a bad temper.

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Shut up.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Even if you catch me today,

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I will kill you every moment in the future.

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I told you to shut up.

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Do you think I dare not?

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Liu Chang,

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
you can't take me away.

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Liu Chang,

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
stop.

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Ziya.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Xuexi,

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
this has nothing to do with you.

85
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I advise you not to interfere in the end.

86
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Mudan is my wife.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I don't want to see you.

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I will protect her.

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
This is the family of the traitor.

90
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
You are the one who did it.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Do you know the consequences?

92
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
You know he is the family of the traitor.

93
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I will tell the king about it in person.

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
But you,

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
you are a man of no value.

96
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
How dare you hide yourself from Mudan?

97
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
How dare you hide yourself from me?

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I will kill you.

99
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,160
I will tell the king about the secret of hiding Mudan and the transfer of troops.

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Go.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
The situation in Jin is very bad.

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Father didn't want me to come.

103
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
But I'm worried about your safety.

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
No one will hurt you again.

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
If you are sad,

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
cry.

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
There is no use in crying.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
I have more important things to do.

109
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Xuexi,

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
how did you know I was in Huanyun House?

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I was entrusted by my father.

112
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I lost my wife.

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
My wife was in trouble.

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I will die.

115
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Get up, Chuan Yu.

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm fine.

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Get up.

118
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
But I didn't...

119
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
But I didn't save you.

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
I didn't protect you.

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
I was in danger.

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
But I survived.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Get up.

124
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Get up and talk.

125
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Hurry up.

126
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Get up, everyone.

127
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Get up.

128
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Get up.

129
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Xuexi told me that

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
you gathered the secret guards

131
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
and hid in the city

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
to find me.

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
You saw the light in time.

134
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
That's why you told Xuexi to come to rescue you.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I will never forget

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
your kindness.

137
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
If Jiang Changyang has a job,

138
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
he will thank you.

139
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
You are a great man.

140
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
We have no one to blame.

141
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Chuan Yu will follow you

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
and take you to the police station.

143
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Chuan Yu will follow you and take you to the police station.

144
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Mudan,

145
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
the situation is not clear now.

146
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
It's too dangerous for you to stay in Chang'an.

147
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Why don't you come back with me?

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Your Majesty,

149
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
the He family is a very dangerous country.

150
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
We can't let them go.

151
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
A woman is a woman.

152
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
If she kills her husband,

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
what else can she do?

154
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
But those secret guards

155
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
are all old foxes.

156
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
They are all smart.

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Only the Xiao family

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
is willing to put a seal on the letter.

159
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I have to

160
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
make a contribution to the He family.

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
I will never offend you before the city is built.

162
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
But Your Majesty...

163
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Don't think I don't know

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
what you are thinking.

165
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
I dare not.

166
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
The most important thing now

167
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
is how to get to the throne.

168
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
The Ministry of Revenue and the Treasury are in control.

169
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
How to subdue those

170
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
unstable secret guards.

171
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't need to teach you.

172
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
I understand.

173
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
The pulse is stable and the internal and external are not injured.

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

175
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
It's good that you are fine.

176
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Look, you are in a hurry.

177
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I told you I'm fine.

178
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Are you all okay?

179
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Did you get any kind of involvement?

180
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Don't worry.

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
We are businessmen.

182
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
We don't like those powerful people.

183
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Liu Chang is just a巡-women.

184
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
He came to check on us.

185
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
But he didn't make it difficult for us.

186
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
But he didn't make it difficult for us.

189
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Where is my cousin?

190
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
How is he?

191
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Li Qing is struggling in the court now.

192
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
It's not easy to live.

193
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
But luckily, he is alive.

194
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
He heard that you are safe.

195
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
He told me to keep an eye on you.

196
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I'm fine as long as I'm safe.

197
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm fine as long as I'm safe.

198
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Mudan.

199
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Everything is done according to what you wrote in the letter.

200
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Liu Lang, Madam Tang, Madam Sun.

201
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
They are all staying in Chang'an to look after the store.

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
And the gardeners and the gardeners in the garden

203
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
are all working in the garden with my father.

204
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,160
As for us, we must go with you.

205
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Don't think that you can just leave us a letter.

206
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
It's your fate to live.

207
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
It's the fate of Mudan.

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
But it's a very dangerous trip.

209
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
We are still alive.

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
I don't want you to get involved.

211
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
We are not afraid.

212
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
We have been defeated.

213
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
We have agreed to live and die together.

214
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,160
And the more difficult it is, the more we have to live together.

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Now we are both free.

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
We have been talking for a long time, but we still can't say it.

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
If we don't go,

218
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
how can we be at ease if we stay in Chang'an?

219
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
That's right.

220
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Okay.

221
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Then we will go together.

222
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I will definitely protect you.

223
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
The three of us will go together.

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
We will come back together.

225
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
We can't miss any of them.

226
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Okay.

227
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
We must protect each other.

228
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
We must protect each other.

229
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
We will be together forever.

230
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
We will never separate.

231
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Never separate.

232
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Da Fu.

233
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,160
In fact, there is only one person in this trip, except the three of us.

234
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Look.

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Chunyu.

236
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Are you okay?

237
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm fine.

238
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Are you hurt?

239
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Mudan.

240
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Have you really thought it over?

241
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
If you come back to Hexi with me,

242
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
I will definitely protect you forever.

243
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
A person and a life,

244
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
only for misunderstanding.

245
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
And I want Xuexi to help me hide the truth.

246
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Don't worry.

247
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
In the future,

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I will make everyone think that you are going to stay with me in Hexi.

249
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Take care of yourself.

250
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Take care.

251
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I didn't expect that I would hide so many things from my heart.

252
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
But it's really too bitter.

253
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,160
It's not easy to have such a good wife like you.

254
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Now, you are so brave.

255
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Now, you are so brave.

256
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,160
And I haven't even seen her for the last year.

257
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Aunt.

258
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Although I'm trying to save myself,

259
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm still worried.

260
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I'm afraid that I will be more selfish.

261
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I don't want to see you cry because of her.

262
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Those traitors.

263
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
They killed her.

264
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
They killed her and her life.

265
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
What can I do?

266
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Aunt.

267
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I have a favor to ask.

268
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Mudan, get up and talk.

269
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Mudan, get up and talk.

271
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not here to ask for trouble.

272
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
I want to ask you to help me avenge Jiang Changyang.

273
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I want to take revenge on the King of Ning.

274
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I want to make all the dead people of the King of Ning suffer.

275
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
The two of you will get 50% off.

276
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
The two of you will get 50% off.

277
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
The two of you will get 50% off.

278
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,160
The little brother will take you to see the beautiful scenery.

279
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,160
A few weeks ago, I sent Chuan Yu to the East of the River to meet General Yu Zheng.

280
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
His father was ambushed by the Queen and killed in Chang'an.

281
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,160
He wanted to avenge his father and take revenge on the Emperor.

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
But General Yu didn't finish his work.

283
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,160
And the East of the River Army was already good at fighting.

284
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,160
So I want to use my business to help them to build their army.

285
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
I want to build a great army and gather good weapons.

286
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I want to get more powerful weapons.

287
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
When the time comes, I will come back to Chang'an.

288
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
I will take the King of Ning and the King of Qing.

289
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
The King of Qing will die in the end.

290
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Mudan, I know you don't want to risk your life for him.

291
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I'm not doing this for Jiang Changyang.

292
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,160
When I decided to open the Wu Yongtang, I understood one thing.

293
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
Only the Ming army can fight in this world.

294
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Only the valley can be independent and the people can live in peace.

295
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,160
And Jiang Changyang died to see the peace.

296
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I will go for him on the road he hasn't finished.

297
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,160
If I die on this road, I will not regret.

298
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Okay.

299
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I will be with you.

300
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Tell me what you need.

301
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Thank you.

302
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I have some gold bars with Suizhi.

303
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
But these are not enough.

304
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Aunt.

305
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,160
I heard from you that you were going to sell gold bars.

306
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,120
are not enough.

307
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,480
My lady,

308
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,060
I heard from you that

309
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,240
you have been to cárceas

310
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,980
and nobles for many years.

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,900
Could you go for a taste of it?

312
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,420
Old Hades water pours

313
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,680
As the dry yellow summer reacts

314
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,960
ission of the net

315
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,860
merges with the season

316
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,660
It turns out theide wine was used to be observed by the living people.

317
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,120
They asks for it.

318
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,740
and ask for it again.

319
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
I can't explain.

320
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,100
The world is full of the evil.

321
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,600
The world is full of introduces.

322
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Amazingly enough, in fact, it was actually me in the preferences.

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,440
You're TEspeaking to me...

324
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,560
I'll not do it again.

325
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,120
Mudan...

326
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm afraid it's a little bitter.

327
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
It's okay.

328
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
It won't be bitter if you drink some tea later.

329
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
How is it?

330
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,760
The wolf has been selling the

331
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
pit for five days.

332
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Have you not received your monthly salary?

333
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Go and tell the owner.

334
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
The tax is getting heavier.

335
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
There are not many companions in the account of the owner.

336
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
I went to their house a few days ago.

337
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Their female wolf is also selling the pit.

338
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
I've got it.

339
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I've got the rice.

340
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Really?

341
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Where is the rice?

342
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
At the dock.

343
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Go and see.

344
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
What's wrong with my son?

345
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
It's just a skin disease.

346
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Dear Hong Kong people,

347
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
the rice is sold out.

348
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
It's only 50 cents a bag.

349
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
We don't have money.

350
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
If you don't have money,

351
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
you can use the local clothes.

352
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
It's hard to find a full-fledged wheat here.

353
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Where did you get the local products?

354
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Yes.

355
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Madam, look.

356
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
The dragon-leaf grass you're wearing

357
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
is not only a decorative plant.

358
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
It's very good for your health.

359
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
It can help you to get rid of the disease.

360
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
It can help you to get rid of the disease.

361
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Please take it.

362
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Look here.

363
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
There are many kinds of fish.

364
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
There are many kinds of fish.

365
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
There are many kinds of fish.

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
There are many kinds of fish.

367
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
We've got them all.

368
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
If you need,

369
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
you can get them.

370
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
You can get them.

371
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Do you understand?

372
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Thank you.

373
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
It's okay.

374
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
We've got them all.

375
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
It's your turn.

376
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I want a bag of rice.

377
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Okay.

378
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
The fish is poorer than the porridge we ate.

379
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
The fish is poorer than the porridge we ate.

380
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
We gave them some money,

381
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
but it's not a loss.

382
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Now we need to prepare food for the He Dong Army.

383
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Now we need to prepare food for the He Dong Army.

384
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
We can't do nothing.

385
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
We can help a little.

386
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Come on.

387
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
Let's go.

388
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
What do you want to buy?

389
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Mom asked me to buy a bowl of oil.

390
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
It's good for the body.

391
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
But I...

392
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
You want to buy this handkerchief for mom?

393
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
You want to buy this handkerchief for mom?

394
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Mom asked me to find a good citizen.

395
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
It will be a good day.

396
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
I want to live a comfortable life with my father.

397
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I want to live a comfortable life with my father.

398
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
He gave me a bag of rice.

399
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I don't think I can break it.

400
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Take it.

401
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I can't break it.

402
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
I only have five cents.

403
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
It's the same as buying me a bowl of rice.

404
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Who said it was for free?

405
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
You bought this handkerchief.

406
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
The oil is equivalent to my money.

407
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
You can return it to me in the future.

408
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
You and I are not related.

409
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Why did you take it?

410
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Because I'm like your mother.

411
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I hope you can be a good citizen.

412
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I hope you can be a good citizen.

413
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I hope you can be a good citizen.

414
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
When you grow up,

415
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
You can pay me five cents.

416
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Take it.

417
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Thank you.

418
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
I will study hard.

419
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
I will study hard.

420
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I will pay you back in the future.

421
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
I will pay you back in the future.

422
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Thank you.

423
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I hope you can be a good citizen.

424
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
I hope you can be a good citizen.

425
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
I will remember.

426
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Thank you.

427
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Don't be afraid.

428
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,040
Don't be afraid.

429
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
The people are not treated in time.

430
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Fortunately, they didn't come to me.

431
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
The medicine is ready.

432
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Three times a day.

433
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Take it back quickly.

434
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
It's a good medicine.

435
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Thank you.

436
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Mr. Yang.

437
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Mr. Feng.

438
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I have no money.

439
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I bought your goods.

440
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
I'm sorry for letting you go.

441
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Mr. Yang.

443
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
What happened here?

444
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Just now,

445
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
The army of the Juebei Manzi came to rob.

446
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
They told the people in the city

447
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
that they would come again tomorrow.

448
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
They told us to put all the food and money

449
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
in the door.

450
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Isn't there a Hedong army here?

451
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
The Juebei army should be afraid.

452
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Didn't you report it?

453
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
We reported it.

454
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
But we are not familiar with the Juebei army.

455
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
The Manzi people

456
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
are like the wind.

457
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
When the Hedong army arrived,

458
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
they had already robbed and left.

459
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
The Hedong army

460
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
also bought goods.

461
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
But they were killed.

462
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
A few months ago,

463
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
another army came.

464
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Now we are also willing to die.

465
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
As long as we don't kill people,

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
we will rob.

467
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Mr. Feng,

468
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
you should go.

469
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
If they catch you,

470
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
they will rob your goods.

471
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,520
The Juebei Manzi

472
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Who are you?

473
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
I am a merchant.

474
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I want to make a big deal with you.

475
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
You look like

476
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
not the Juebei Iron Banner,

477
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,520
but the hunter.

478
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
What do you mean?

479
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I am a hunter.

480
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
What do you mean?

481
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
You look down on us.

482
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I didn't mean that.

483
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Tang is a country of etiquette.

484
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
It is more tolerant to other countries.

485
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
You only rob and don't hurt people.

486
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
It's not a murder.

487
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
I'm afraid it's because

488
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
there is no food in the family.

489
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I have to do this.

490
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
What do you want from us?

491
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
I know a Juebei woman.

492
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
She told me

493
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
that your land is not good for farming.

494
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
But cattle are raised very well.

495
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
And there are very good horses.

496
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
And in our country,

497
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
horses can be used to farm and transport goods.

498
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Sheep can be used to eat.

499
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Sheep can be used to make food.

500
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
The common food in your country

501
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
can be used for a very high profit.

502
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
And the cattle can be used to feed.

503
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
The sheep can be used to make food.

504
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
The common food in your country

505
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
can be used for a very high profit.

506
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
And the cattle can be used to feed.

507
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Why don't you trade with me?

508
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
With money,

509
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
can't you buy rice?

510
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
We can rob

511
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
and get food.

512
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Why do you have to buy it?

513
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
General Yuzheng is in charge of the contract.

514
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
How long do you have to rob?

515
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
And how many people have died

516
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
to rob food?

517
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
This city

518
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
will only get poorer and poorer.

519
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The food you get

520
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
will only get less and less.

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
This is not a long-term solution.

522
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If we trade well,

523
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
except for rice,

524
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
you can also bring

525
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
more good things to your family.

526
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
When you get sick,

527
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
we have medicine and food.

528
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We can meet and talk.

529
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Isn't it a great joy?

530
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's go back and discuss with the people.

531
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I'll give you the answer in three days.

532
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I'm waiting for your good news.

533
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
They are gone.

534
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Come out, everyone.

535
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
It's safe.

536
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Come out.

537
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Great.

538
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Master Feng is right.

539
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Please accept our bow.

540
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Thank you.

541
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Please get up.

542
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Thank you.

543
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
Thank you.

544
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Please get up.

545
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
Thank you.

546
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
If this is successful,

547
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
it's a good thing for me.

548
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
I just don't know

549
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
if they will agree.

550
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
But you don't have to worry too much.

551
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Yesterday I sent a message

552
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
to the Hedong Army.

553
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
If the people in the north are obsessed,

554
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
General Yu Zheng will talk to them in person.

555
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,320
He will solve this problem.

556
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Don't worry.

557
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Thank you, Master Feng.

558
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Thank you, Master Feng.

559
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Thank you.

560
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Congratulations.

561

Sister.

564
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
No need.

565
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Thank you.

566
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
You're welcome.

567
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Thank you.

568
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
I won't take it.

569
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
Thank you.

570
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
You're welcome.

571
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Thank you.

572
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
Thank you.

573
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Thank you, Master Feng.

574
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Go.

575
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,700

576
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,080

Und reader

579
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,740
Go.

580
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,780
Damn it.

581
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,780
cotton

582
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,780
start

583
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,120
It can't be.

584
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,320
It can't be combination.

585
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
What does it take?

586
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,000
Which division would occupy you?

587
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Each division.

588
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
from the place in siewir's palace

589
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,840
they don't,

590
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:05,040
they can't go to

591
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,280
his place.

592
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,440
The blue told her

593
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,880
they come to live with the excellency Life

594
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,720
Princess,

595
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,760
It's important.

596
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,040
Mudan asked me and my father to get it.

597
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,600
I haven't seen Chuan Yu for days.

598
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,400
Where is he?

599
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,480
Mudan asked Chuan Yu to do something.

600
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,160
He'll be back tomorrow.

601
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
Why do you send a post?

602
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,960
The drug store's head

603
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,840
thought it's good to work in our business.

604
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,440
He heard I have a capable niece.

605
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,160
He asked me to work with Mudan and his brother.

606
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm sorry, live lines are missing.

607
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,960
You look professional.

608
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,560
I'm eating like your brother.

609
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
Nice to meet you.

610
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm Baiげ Sheng ciento.

611
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,480
Give this to you, come figure.

612
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,040
They're my endlich parents.

613
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
They're all really nice.

614
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,640
Take the medicine quickly.

615
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,880
Yes, your highness.

616
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
Sit down on this chair.

617
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,760
Sit down.

618
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,960
If Mudan is really released,

619
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,200
Sister Han Yi won't stop us.

620
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,320
She will be the only one to remember.

621
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,160
The great Buddha and the川芋 have made an appointment.

622
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,160
They will be born as the dead.

623
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
The川芋 has finally opened its doors.

624
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I've made up my mind again.

625
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I will not let you go.

626
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I will not let you go.

627
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I will not let you go.

628
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
I've made up my mind again.

629
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
But who is Jiang Dashan?

630
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
I don't have such a bad name.

631
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Then why did you give me the name Jiang Xiaohua?

632
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You are now a traitor.

633
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
How can you use your real name?

634
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Just use it together.

635
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Your blood

636
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
has reached the ground of Han Yi and Chi Chi.

637
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Even the king of the king can't find them,

638
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
so he just divided them up.

639
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
You are a traitor.

640
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
How can you suffer like this?

641
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
You are the best at acting.

642
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,160
You just have to act again and lie to the king.

643
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
I can lie to the god of ghosts.

644
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
But you,

645
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
don't lie to yourself anymore.

646
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm not here anymore.

647
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
I should let go of the past

648
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
and start over.

649
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
I...

650
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I...

651
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I've changed my name.

652
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
I've traveled to all directions.

653
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
I've been to the north of the Jue.

654
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
I've seen many vast lands

655
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
that you have never seen before.

656
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Why don't you start over?

657
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm here tonight

658
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
because you are so stubborn

659
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
that you can't stop.

660
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Have you forgotten?

661
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
You said on the boat

662
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
that even if I'm not here,

663
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
you can still live a good life.

664
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I'm having a good time these days.

665
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I'm not making money

666
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
to save the people,

667
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
but to help the He Dong Army

668
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
buy military equipment.

669
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I've never let down my wish.

670
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
But at this moment,

671
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
you in front of me

672
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
is not good.

673
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
It's just that

674
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
I'm a little sad.

675
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
I'm just a little upset.

678
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm sorry you're not here.

679
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
You can't see what I've done.

680
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Mudan...

681
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Don't say it anymore.

682
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
You grew up in my heart.

683
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
I can't put my heart in one place.

684
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I promise you

685
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
to be together forever.

686
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Don't go.

687
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Don't go.

688
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Why can I touch you?

689
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Is it a boat?

690
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Zhichuan sent you back to me.

691
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Mudan...

692
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
This is in a dream.

693
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
The road is on the cute cloud.

694
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,880
The fire-graowaou

695
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,920
with the Stars in the sky

696
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,160
will eventually reach out to you.

697
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
But my secret is still hidden.

698
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Shush, ssh.

699
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Walk like a knife in your own eyes.

700
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
I'm sorry.

701
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Master, the goods are here.

702
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Coming.

703
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Mr. Du, this is Master Feng.

704
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
He came to deliver the goods.

705
00:39:50,160 --> 00:40:02,820
The

706
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
goods are here.

707
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Why don't you come in and talk?

708
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
You're so generous.

709
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Come on.

710
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Mr. Du, please.

711
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Master, you can take my men to deliver the goods.

712
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
Okay.

713
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Chunyu.

714
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Deliver the goods.

715
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Master Feng, you must know a lot of things.

716
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
No matter which merchant is in charge of the goods,

717
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
I must be filial.

718
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
I heard a little bit.

719
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,160
But I only brought two carts of goods today.

720
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
I can't afford to buy the goods you have.

721
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
After this order, you still have to go north.

722
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
The other goods are in the city.

723
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,160
The county magistrate is really well prepared.

724
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Let your men go.

725
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,160
No matter if you take the money or the goods,

726
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,160
you can't leave me without 500 yuan.

727
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Why bother the county magistrate?

728
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I've already prepared a gift for you.

729
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Chunyu, you can go.

730
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I'm going.

731
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Master Feng, you must be filial.

732
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Chunyu.

733
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,160
You have a new fish-trap?

734
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
I have a common business with the new fish-trap.

735
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I never touch any of the goods.

736
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,160
County magistrate, you don't look familiar with this fish-trap.

737
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
It came from your house.

738
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,160
You didn't recognize it.

739
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,160
How dare you steal from the official's house?

740
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,160
I'll tie you up.

741
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
The county magistrate is a fish-trap.

742
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Not only the fish-trap,

743
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,160
but also the poster on your body is a gold-trap.

744
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Of course, I have a lot of evidence.

745
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
If I can't leave the city today,

746
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,160
my men will hand over all of these.

747
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,160
