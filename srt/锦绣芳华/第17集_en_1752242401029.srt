We root for you to enter the Feature printed series.

10
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,240
Brother Mu!

11
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
The peace between us is your wish.

12
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,300
But why do you have to die for this?

13
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
I'm sorry for you.

14
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
And I'm sorry for them.

15
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,780
I can't remember you in a fair way.

16
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,420
I'm going to die for you.

17
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
It's my job.

18
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,780

Our Lord, theisha has men Maid Bell from Independence Suisse横INDISTINCT

20
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:48,720
The topic was succumbed to the cud grabs of the

21
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
Master, Master Lu is Master Lu. You are you.

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
The plan of the situation has been planned for a long time.

23
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
There will be no problems.

24
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Is Wudang in the manor?

25
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Master, have you thought it through?

26
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I have.

27
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I will go to the manor.

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I will go with you.

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I will go with you.

30
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I will go with you.

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I will go with you.

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I will go with you.

33
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
I will go with you.

34
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
I will go with you.

35
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Tu Niu, I came all this way not to see Wudang.

36
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Master, master.

37
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Lame guy.

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,680
This is not true.

39
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,880
When you are around,

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
you are really in the relationship with the Master Lu.

41
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,640
Mr. Lu veterans those initiative works.

42
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,040
It was really a gift for my master and I hope

43
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
You're not afraid of death, are you?

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
You're afraid that you'll die for nothing.

45
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
That's why you're forcing me to leave.

46
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,040
The husband said that he wishes you a happy and prosperous life.

47
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll take my leave.

48
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
You think so?

49
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
You don't know what life's like without me.

50
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
You're so popular with your boyfriend now.

51
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,040
The red peaches are not found in the southern mountains.

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Stop!

53
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Go on!

54
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Hurry up!

55
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Go!

56
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Master, we caught a strange beggar in the mountains.

57
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I don't know if he's a secret agent of the King of Ning.

58
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Take him away!

59
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Yes!

60
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Go!

61
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Young Mistress!

62
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Go!

63
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
There are no secret agents in the pass.

64
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
If they really take you as a spy of the King of Ning,

65
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
you will be killed right there.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
You will die too unjustly.

67
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Don't do such a dangerous thing again.

68
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm here today, Xing'er.

69
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Otherwise, I would never know.

70
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
The people in your yard are not secret agents.

71
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
They are dead.

72
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
They will die in peace.

73
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I...

74
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
I...

75
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I...

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
I...

77
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm not here to bother you.

78
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
I'm here to ask for an answer.

79
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,040
But after I saw all these,

80
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
I have already got the answer.

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Jiang Changyang,

82
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
I have never experienced your past.

83
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
I have never stood in your place.

84
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
I have never experienced the burden you carry.

85
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
But since I have a crush on you,

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
even if I don't agree with your decision,

87
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I will respect your choice.

88
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Don't worry.

89
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I will write the letter of apology.

90
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Just ask Chuan Yu to come and get it.

91
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Thank you.

92
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Thank you.

93
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Thank you.

94
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
And

95
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
It's not about your feelings.

96
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm the owner of the Wu Yongtang store.

97
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Okay.

98
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm leaving.

99
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I'm leaving.

100
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
When you just received this hairpin,

101
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
it was broken.

102
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Maybe at that time,

103
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
it was destined to end.

104
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Mudan.

105
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
The goods from Huazhou are ready.

106
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Let me see.

107
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Mudan.

108
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
The days of Huazhou are coming.

109
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,040
This is the big day of our store and Wu Yongtang.

110
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
There must be no mistakes.

111
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I have to take a good look.

112
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
After the trip,

113
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,040
the boat with Wu Yongtang and Hua Manzhu will go south.

114
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
The boat will be full of medicine.

115
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,040
The young lady will also go south with the boat

116
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
and set up a branch in the south.

117
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
This is what she wants to do most.

118
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
The waterway will stop.

119
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
When she comes back,

120
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
the court will be over.

121
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
But I heard the man say that

122
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
the young lady took all the goods.

123
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
She may not return.

124
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,040
She may stay in the south to look after the branch.

125
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
She may also go to the south after setting up the shop.

126
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Mister,

127
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
we may not see each other again.

128
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
The mountains are high and the water is long.

129
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
If you regret it in the future,

130
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
you may not find her.

131
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
If she stays in Chang'an,

132
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
I will be very worried.

133
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
If she stays in Chang'an,

134
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
I will not only regret it.

135
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
I can't bear it,

136
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
but I can't stand it.

137
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
If she can be free in the mountains and waters,

138
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
that's good.

139
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Then...

140
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I'll go get the letter of apology.

141
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll go get the letter of apology.

142
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
The snow white bottle of Maiji Lixue

143
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
invites you to continue watching.

144
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
The 96 times of the emerald gold

145
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
is the motherland of the snow.

146
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
It invites you to continue watching.

147
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
When the cruise ends,

148
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
I'll send a letter for her.

149
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I'll ask her myself.

150
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
The Lixue Flower Shop

151
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
thanks for your support.

152
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
May you have a better year.

153
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
May you have a better year.

154
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
Thanks for your support.

155
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Good!

156
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Good!

157
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Good!

158
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Good!

159
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
Good!

160
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Good!

161
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Good!

162
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Good!

163
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Good!

164
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Good!

165
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Thanks to your support,

166
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
the Lixue Flower Shop

167
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,040
can be established in Chang'an.

168
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
The new Wuyong Hall

169
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
is decorated with flowers

170
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
and the boat is ready to sail.

171
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Today, on this boat,

172
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
we have prepared

173
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
the sea-flowers with goji berries.

174
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Welcome to come and taste

175
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
the emerald gold!

176
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Good!

177
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Good!

178
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Please enjoy.

179
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Lixue Flower Shop

180
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
This is for you.

181
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Thank you.

182
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Goodbye.

183
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
The flower is beautiful.

184
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
The flower is beautiful.

185
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
The flower is beautiful.

186
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
The flower is beautiful.

187
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Sister, Jiang Changyang hasn't sent someone to get the cheongsam.

188
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,040
How about I go and give him some wine to cheer him up?

189
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,040
It's okay. After I leave, you can give it to him.

190
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Okay.

191
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
He, make a cake for father.

192
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Okay.

193
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Today, our cake and the honeycomb cake are cheap.

194
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I remember that you used this method before.

195
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
If you save some more today...

196
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Okay.

197
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I'll take five more of these.

198
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Okay.

199
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
You go and get the goods.

200
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Okay.

201
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Thank you.

202
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
The wine you want.

203
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Here.

204
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I want to see you.

205
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,040
You mean, when you're in danger next time,

206
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,040
you'll come to see me when you're in danger.

207
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Don't be sad.

208
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
At worst, you'll be in danger.

209
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I'll come back from the beginning.

210
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I'll be with you.

211
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Then I'll take it as a yes.

212
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
The moon in the water...

213
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
If you hold it in your hands,

214
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
it will slowly slip away.

215
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
You're drunk.

216
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
You'll get a lot of weight.

217
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Go back to your hometown.

218
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I've signed the letter of apology.

219
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,040
I wish you a safe and successful life.

220
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Tomorrow, I'll leave Chang'an.

221
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
I'll be waiting for you.

222
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Bye.

223
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
It's good to be in the south.

224
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,040
It's a great opportunity to change the world.

225
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
This is your dream.

226
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
You were my dream too.

227
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
So tonight,

228
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
I'll send you a letter.

229
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Okay.

230
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Since it's a letter,

231
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I'll drink a glass of wine before I leave.

232
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I've already prepared the wine.

233
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I'll be waiting for you.

234
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Bye.

235
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
After drinking this wine,

236
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
you'll make a grand achievement.

237
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'll go to the four seas.

238
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
We'll...

239
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
part ways.

240
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I'll go to the four seas.

241
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
I'll go to the four seas.

242
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
I'll go to the four seas.

243
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
I'll go to the four seas.

244
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll go to the four seas.

245
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
I'll go to the four seas.

246
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I'll go to the four seas.

247
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I'll go to the four seas.

248
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I'll go to the four seas.

249
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
I'll go to the four seas.

250
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I'll go to the four seas.

251
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'll go to the four seas.

252
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
I'll go to the four seas.

253
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I'll go to the four seas.

254
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
I'll go to the four seas.

255
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I'll go to the four seas.

256
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
I'll go to the four seas.

257
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I'll go to the four seas.

258
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
I'll go to the four seas.

259
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I'll go to the four seas.

260
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
I'll go to the four seas.

261
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
I'll go to the four seas.

262
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
I'll go to the four seas.

263
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I'll go to the four seas.

264
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I'll go to the four seas.

265
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I'll go to the four seas.

266
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I'll go to the four seas.

267
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'll go to the four seas.

268
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'll go to the four seas.

269
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I'll go to the four seas.

270
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
I'll go to the four seas.

271
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I'll go to the four seas.

272
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll go to the four seas.

273
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I'll go to the four seas.

274
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I'll go to the four seas.

275
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I'll go to the four seas.

276
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I'll go to the four seas.

277
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
I'll go to the four seas.

278
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I'll go to the four seas.

279
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I'll go to the four seas.

280
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I'll go to the four seas.

281
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I'll go to the four seas.

282
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I'll go to the four seas.

283
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll go to the four seas.

284
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll go to the four seas.

285
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,040
I've already come to know about Mr. Lu.

286
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,040
I won't let the same thing happen to you.

287
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,040
They say that he and Mrs. Lu are deeply in love.

288
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,040
But if Mrs. Lu knew about this,

289
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,040
would she still choose to marry Mr. Lu?

290
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,040
No one can decide this.

291
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Only Mrs. Lu knows it in her heart.

292
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
And you never asked me.

293
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I can't be so selfish.

294
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
But you can't make a choice for me.

295
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
When you were in Pei Zhong's villa,

296
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
you said that I was dead.

297
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Will you regret it?

298
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
You didn't tell me your feelings earlier.

299
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You let me die.

300
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
I was dead.

301
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
But if you didn't tell me your feelings earlier,

302
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
I would have died.

303
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
But if you didn't tell me your feelings before you died,

304
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
it would be a waste of time.

305
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
You know my feelings.

306
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
But I want you to tell me.

307
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Even if we parted tonight,

308
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
I don't want to see you again.

309
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I have no regrets.

310
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Yes.

311
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I love you.

312
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
I love you more than my life.

313
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
So I have to let you go.

314
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
I can't accept those feelings.

315
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
What if I die in front of you?

316
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
You will be in pain.

317
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
What if I can't protect you?

318
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I will be in trouble.

319
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Do you think I will die without my husband?

320
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
Or you think I can't protect myself?

321
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I tell you.

322
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
If I choose you,

323
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I can bear losing you one day.

324
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Wu Yongtang and Qingshu Villa

325
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
are in the south of the city.

326
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm not losing you in the decision to save the people.

327
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
I can be your weapon.

328
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
We can fight.

329
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Why do you give up the happiness we can have for the fear of unknown?

330
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I heard your sincere words tonight.

331
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
You can go.

332
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,040
I love you.

333
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Hai Liujiu.

334
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
You are here tonight.

335
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I will be here forever.

336
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,040
I will be here forever.

337
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,040
You finally got rid of your husband's doubts.

338
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
What?

339
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Your husband doesn't want to leave us.

340
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
What?

341
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I will take you to the ship.

342
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I have prepared the luggage.

343
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I will go with Sun Danyang.

344
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
We will have a good time.

345
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,040
You should take good care of her.

346
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Don't let her be bullied by Jiang Jun.

347
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Don't worry.

348
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Let's eat.

349
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Thank you for your hard work.

350
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Let's eat.

351
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
This is delicious.

352
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Let's eat more.

353
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Thank you.

354
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
See you.

355
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Zhang Chaoyang.

356
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,480
Gave Chang Yang

357
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,440
I feel a little bit cool under the salt.

358
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,040
I want to taste it for Mudan.

359
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,240
Vita Lemon Tea.

360
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
This color, right now.

361
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,640
Mudan!

362
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,240
Mudan!

363
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
I made you some purple ginseng wine.

364
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,640
Come on, try it.

365
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Hey, Da Fu!

366
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,840
Where is he?

367
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,040
He's...

368
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,840
If he doesn't use the air, I'll ruin his house!

369
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,840
Take it!

370
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,240
Sisters!

371
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Where is Jiang Haoran?

372
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
He's... he's back there.

373
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I've been trying to beat him for days.

374
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,040
Look at him!

375
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,840
Today I'll go and pinch his neck.

376
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,040
I'll pinch his neck.

377
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,440
I'll give him a new fat punch!

378
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,240
This...

379
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Jiang Changyang

380
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,440
didn't prepare the final product, did he?

381
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,240
How dare he!

382
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,040
What are you doing?

383
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
What are you doing?

384
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
It's said that the one who gets married first wins.

385
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Now I admit defeat.

386
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,840
I'll take the gold.

387
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,240
I hope you'll accept these gold.

388
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,840
So much money!

389
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,840
So much money!

390
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,840
It seems that he's married already.

391
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,440
Why did he send so many people?

392
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,840
Since he's here to take the money,

393
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
why didn't he tell me before leaving?

394
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,440
I was thinking that when you wake up,

396
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,840
you'll be happier

397
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,640
when you see so much money.

398
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
Don't talk nonsense.

399
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,240
He's here.

400
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Let's go back.

401
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,040
Let's go.

402
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Come on!

403
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,040
Stop looking!

404
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Let's go!

405
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,640
Didn't you get robbed before?

406
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,640
Where did you get so much money?

407
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,840
Which great corrupt official

408
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,240
doesn't have a foot to crawl?

409
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,440
You just came back to get the money?

410
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,840
I got up early and entered the hall.

411
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,440
I've made a deal with the Great Zang Long.

412
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
When Suqinning King comes,

413
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,440
my brother can be searched everywhere.

414
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,040
When the lady's shop is open,

415
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
I'll follow her.

416
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,640
In the future,

417
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,840
you can't avoid me.

418
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,640
Don't regret it.

419
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
For the money,

420
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,240
I won't regret it.

421
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,640
You were so angry just now

422
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
that you brought someone to the Jiang Mansion.

423
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Do you think

424
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,440
I regret it after I woke up?

425
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,840
I don't think so.

426
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Let me ask you.

427
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,040
You're trying to scare me, right?

428
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm not.

429
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,640
I've already lost all my money.

430
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,240
Jiang Qiao, what are you doing?

431
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Go away!

432
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Come on!

433
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Let me go!

434
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Let me go!

435
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I'll walk on my own.

436
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
What are you doing?

437
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,040
What?

438
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
What are you doing?

439
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm not afraid of you.

440
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm afraid of you.

441
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm afraid of you.

442
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I'm afraid of you.

443
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm afraid of you.

444
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
I'm afraid of you.

445
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
I'm afraid of you.

446
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm afraid of you.

447
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,440
If you get angry one day,

448
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
you'll be angry at her again.

449
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
There's another way.

450
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,440
In case you're upset,

451
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
you'll regret it.

452
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,640
If you're with me,

453
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
I'll help you get rid of your thoughts.

454
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,040
So that you won't be sad

455
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,840
about the disaster every night.

456
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Yes, yes, yes.

457
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,440
You're the most stubborn person.

458
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,240
How can I escape your hands?

459
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,840
You're not allowed to escape again.

460
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
You're not allowed to push me away.

461
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,640
You're not allowed to leave me.

462
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,840
I'm not drunk and impulsive.

463
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,440
I'll love my life more for you.

464
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
You look good.

465
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
How is it?

466
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
It's pretty.

467
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Nice.

468
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,720
Twenty thousandmeters apart,

469
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,600
apart from spring.

470
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,840
When we were together

471
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,640
for a long time we betrayed each other.

472
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,520
We never kept signfag алфа заδр Altogether up to the wind,

473
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,560
we never said go away.

474

475
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,740
In the departments he horses to gather

split twelveס artistes.

477
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,360
I and Weifang, whether in the future,

478
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,360
in trouble or in peace,

479
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,360
we will never regret what we have done today.

480
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Wait a minute, Uncle.

481
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
In the West, we are a married family.

482
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
You don't really have a wedding ring.

483
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Today, I specially drew a pair of three-dressed brides for you.

484
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Before the wedding ring is drawn,

485
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,360
we must not leave this house.

486
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
This is the place!

487
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
The old house.

488
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
We have finally arrived!

489
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Here we are.

490
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I am Zhang Qian, the相供 from Yangzhou.

491
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,360
This is Mady from Xuanzhong,

492
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
and Luo Ning from Taiyuan.

493
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
11 of the相供 from Luoyang have already left,

494
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
and have already settled in the base.

495
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
You are Zhang Qian?

496
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
I am lucky to have read your novel.

497
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
I am a really good poet.

498
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I am a poet.

499
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
I am a poet.

500
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
I am a poet.

501
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
I am a poet.

502
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
I am a poet.

503
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
I am a poet.

504
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
I am a poet.

505
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
I am a poet.

506
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
You are Zhang Qian.

507
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
I am lucky to have read your poem.

508
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
I am a really good poet.

509
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Let me take everyone inside.

510
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Come, this way.

511
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Please.

512
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Please.

513
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,360
Liu Jun, when will the King come back?

514
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Today, we must see the King to be at ease.

515
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Have you read the history books of the Han Gate?

516
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
If the King does not return,

517
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
the children of the Shi family

518
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,360
will not be able to make it.

519
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
The day of the death.

520
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Everyone,

521
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
everyone, please be patient.

522
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
The King is not in the mansion.

523
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,360
He is trying to find a way for everyone.

524
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
When will the King come back?

525
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
There are no opportunities for everyone.

526
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
Everyone,

527
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
you can't just look at the King.

528
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,360
After all, this concerns the future of the children of the Shi family.

529
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
The Duke is a private farmer.

530
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Isn't it easy to deal with a few poor scholars?

531
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,360
I am in charge of the property of the House of Cang Chu.

532
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
It's not their property.

533
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
The Spring is coming.

534
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
It's the time when the warm books are ready to be read.

535
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
It's just a pity.

536
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,360
The Spring is short and long.

537
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,360
When the dusk comes,

538
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
we have to light the lamps.

539
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Then...

540
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Then, what does Lord Liu mean?

541
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,360
Let father cut off the oil and oil from the lamps.

542
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,360
So that they can't read the warm books and prepare for the exam.

543
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,360
The Duke is supposed to check the Cang Chu regularly.

544
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Even if he finds out the method of the science,

545
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
it's not a big deal.

546
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
I have already told the people of Zhu Mu.

547
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
From today on,

548
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,360
all kinds of meat and meat must be checked.

549
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,360
If they can't get into the Eastern and Western regions,

550
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,360
they can't even practice oil.

551
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
The Spring is coming.

552
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,360
It's the time when the warm books are ready to be read.

553
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
When the dusk comes,

554
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
we have to light the lamps.

555
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Then, what does Lord Liu mean?

556
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Let father cut off the oil and oil from the lamps.

557
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Then, what does Lord Liu mean?

558
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Let father cut off the oil and oil from the lamps.

559
