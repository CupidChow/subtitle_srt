Hurry!

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Xiaochun, where is Mudan?

75
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
She is still in there saving people

76
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,740
The stairs are collapsed

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,740
There are people in the basement

78
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
Go with me to save people

79
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
Chanyu, Dafu, go to save people

80
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,740
Yes

81
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Do you want to die?

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,940
Who's scared?

83
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,020
Let's go, let's go.

84
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,620
Stay calm.

85
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740

88
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Zhe Liang!

89
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Zhe Liang!

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Mutan!

91
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
Mutan!

92
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
Zhe Liang!

93
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Zhe Liang!

94
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Wake up!

95
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
Wake up!

97
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Zhe Liang!

98
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Zhe Liang!

99
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Zhe Liang!

100
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Zhe Liang!

101
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Zhe Liang!

102
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Zhe Liang!

103
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
ерьмIsn't Zhe Liang here?!

104
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
What's wrong with you?

105
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Come with us, 촬영 crew.

106
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Though it's乐жин world,

107
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
we still need to worry.

108
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
And no one is about to leave.

109
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Here.

110
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
Wait for me.

111
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Wait for me.

112
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Wait for me.

113
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420

114
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Ania!

115
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Jiang Chaoyang!

116
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Jiang Chaoyang!

117
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
Jiang Chaoyang!

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,380
Wake up, Jiang Chaoyang!

119
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Jiang Chaoyang!

120
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Don't worry.

121
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,540
I'm here.

122
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
I won't hurt you.

123
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Let's go out together.

124
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Ania!

125
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Ania!

126
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,620
Let's fight!

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,280
It's

128
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,140
Everyone, cover!

129
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,060
Ready, get ready, everyone!

130
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,520
Ready, got it, in my face...

131
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,000
holding estás!

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ania!

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,520
Who would dare hit from a trap?

134
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,340
Come on, give me the peony.

135
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Peony!

136
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Peony!

137
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
Peony, give it to me.

138
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,340
Here, take it.

139
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
How are you, Your Highness?

140
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm fine.

141
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,540
How are the others?

142
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,340
The most dangerous place is the most dangerous.

143
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,740
There are also flower beds for peonies.

144
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Doctor, please.

145
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
Peony!

146
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,940
You just saved people, but you still go to save flowers?

147
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,140
No.

148
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,140
All the flowers in the capital are thanks to the peonies in that house.

149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,340
No matter how precious the peonies are, they are not as important as your life.

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,540
It's okay, Jiang Changyang.

151
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Let me go.

152
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,740
Let me go!

153
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,140
I said it's okay!

154
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Peony!

155
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Peony!

156
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Peony!

157
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Your Highness!

158
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Peony!

159
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Your Highness!

160
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
Peony,

161
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
you're awake.

162
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
How are you?

163
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
Are you feeling dizzy?

164
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Are you feeling okay?

165
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Xiaochun,

166
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
how are you?

167
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
I'm fine.

168
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
How about the garden?

169
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
How is the garden?

170
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
You're still hurt.

171
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Help me.

172
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Help me.

173
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
You...

174
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
How could this happen?

175
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
How could this happen?

176
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
The Imperial Household Department is investigating.

177
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
They will definitely tell us.

178
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,740
I'm worried about the investigation.

179
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
We must investigate it ourselves.

180
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Nuanfang,

181
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,740
Nuanfang, let's go, Xiaochun.

182
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
Go and check the garden.

183
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Okay.

184
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
Okay.

185
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Okay.

186
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Nuanfang, let's go, Xiaochun.

187
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Go and check the garden.

188
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Okay.

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Peony!

190
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Peony!

191
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Hurry up!

192
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Hurry up!

193
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Isn't the garden destroyed by the fire?

194
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,740
How did these flowers...

195
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
The garden was in chaos.

196
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Everyone was busy saving the injured and the trapped.

197
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
No one was taking care of the flowers.

198
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
But there was only one person.

199
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
He was in a hurry.

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Peony!

201
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Peony!

202
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
Your Highness!

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Your Highness!

204
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
Peony!

205
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Peony!

206
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Xiaochun,

207
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
take care of Peony for me.

208
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Okay.

209
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
The fire is very serious.

210
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
The general has invited the firemen outside.

211
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
They have secured the rootstock in time.

212
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
They just brought it back.

213
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Who was the one who scolded the others

214
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,740
for not taking care of the flowers?

215
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Are you okay?

216
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
You left the money for the firework

217
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
in the Eastern Mountains.

218
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Thank you.

219
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
The general has turned himself against the fire.

220
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
The firework was destroyed by the smoke.

221
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
It has caused a hole in the throat.

222
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
So you'd better keep your voice down.

223
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
You are afraid of fire.

224
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Now you risk your life to save the flowers.

225
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
I owe you so much.

226
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
How can I repay you?

227
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
The general means that

228
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
he is afraid of the fire.

229
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
He is afraid of the fire.

230
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
But he is afraid of his own love

231
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
and the death of his loved ones.

232
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
He is afraid that you will hurt yourself

233
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
for the sake of your hard work.

234
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
This is not a normal human nature.

235
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
This is...

236
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Go, go, go.

237
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Go, go, go.

238
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
I understand.

239
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Do you want to act in front of them?

240
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Go.

241
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
I want to see you.

242
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
You mean that

243
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
when you are in danger

244
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
and want to see the sky,

245
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
you will come here?

246
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't be sad.

247
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Don't be sad.

248
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,740
At the worst,

249
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
you can come from the beginning.

250
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
I will be with you.

251
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
I will take it seriously.

252
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
I will take it seriously.

253
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Are you done?

254
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm done.

255
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
You are like a child.

256
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
You will find another husband.

257
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Isn't it better?

258
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
You know.

259
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
So you think I'm vicious

260
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
and force me to be a snake, right?

261
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I can't take it off.

262
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
So I destroyed that dragon.

263
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,740
So I love you so much.

264
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
I can't take it.

265
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Why do you have to love me?

266
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I can feel freedom only when I love you.

267
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
You are everything I want.

268
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
But I can't take it off.

269
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I can't take it off.

270
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,740
I can't take it off.

271
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
But I want to see you

272
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
and think of He Weifang.

273
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
And think of He Weifang.

274
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
What else can I do?

275
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
What else can I do?

276
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,740
What else can I do?

277
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
What else can I do?

278
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Why don't you understand, Liu Zhen?

279
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Even if there is no He Weifang,

280
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
I can't trust you.

281
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
But if you want to kill him,

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,740
you are forcing me to hate you forever.

283
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
I don't understand.

284
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Didn't you say that you love each other

285
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
and swear to never leave each other?

286
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
Why can't you

287
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
put me in your heart

288
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
and try again?

289
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Love each other?

290
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,740
We have missed the time when we loved each other.

291
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Everything after that

292
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
is not worth it.

293
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Everything after that

294
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
is not worth it.

295
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
We are all young

296
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
and forced to do it.

297
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
If we keep fighting each other,

298
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,740
it's just a matter of getting old

299
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,740
and making a wish.

300
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
Why bother?

301
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Then let's make a wish

302
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,740
of getting old together.

303
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
I torture He Weifang, you torture me.

304
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I tell you,

305
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I'd rather not let go

306
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
of this for the rest of my life.

307
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,740
I can try to be better to you.

308
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
To make you less anxious,

309
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
less painful.

310
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
But I have one condition.

311
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Don't hurt him again.

312
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Do you love him

313
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
or pity me?

314
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Think about it.

315
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
I promise you.

316
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Don't live in the park.

317
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Go home, okay?

318
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
I love you.

319
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Sixth brother, dinner is ready.

320
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Okay, let's eat first.

321
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Go.

322
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Be careful.

323
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
Nowadays, everything needs money.

324
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
If we build a park,

325
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
the house will be empty.

326
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
The furniture will be damaged.

327
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
We need to buy new ones.

328
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Madam,

329
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
we'd better build a park first.

330
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
The most fragrant building will be built

331
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
in the spring.

332
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Then we can have a feast.

333
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,740
What do you think?

334
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
You are right.

335
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
Do as you say.

336
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Why is it so plain?

337
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm very hungry.

338
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
I want to eat lamb.

339
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,740
You want to drink, right?

340
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
Xiaochun said

341
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
you have a fever.

342
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
It's not a small wound.

343
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
It's hot now.

344
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
If you have a fever,

345
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
it will be difficult to deal with.

346
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
Before the festival,

347
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
you should eat fish, lamb and what else?

348
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Wine.

349
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Yes, you can't eat it.

350
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
I'm useless.

351
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
I can't save my sister.

352
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,740
I can't even protect myself.

353
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Now there are few people in the park.

354
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
We have to work hard

355
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
to send food for us.

356
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
It doesn't matter.

357
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
You used to cook for us.

358
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Now you can try my cooking.

359
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
You don't have to blame yourself.

360
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Try it.

361
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Madam's cooking is getting better.

362
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Of course.

363
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
I put some lotus leaves in the soup.

364
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
It's good for the lungs and kidneys.

365
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
It's the best for the patient.

366
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
You two should drink more.

367
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,740
Jiang Jun's throat is bruised.

368
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
It's normal.

369
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
We should send him two bowls later.

370
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Sure.

371
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Madam.

372
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Chunyu.

373
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
I know you're injured.

374
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,740
So I made a soup for you.

375
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,740
I want to send you a bowl.

376
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,740
How can you let your heart down?

377
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,740
I haven't tasted it yet.

378
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
What does it taste like?

379
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Give it to me.

380
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,740
I'll drink it.

381
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
How can you do that?

382
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
You can't let your heart down.

383
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
I'll drink both bowls.

384
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
How is his wound?

385
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,740
Is it better?

386
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
Can you talk?

387
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
I was thinking about Madam's cooking.

388
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,740
She's been talking about it for a long time.

389
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:20,320
The Saint's

390
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,740
Eat.

391
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
Sir.

392
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
The most dangerous parts of the fire

393
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
are the traces of the oil.

394
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
I think you guessed it.

395
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
The people hid the oil

396
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
in the wooden box.

397
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
It's a huge amount.

398
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,740
It's a big amount.

399
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
The traces of the fire are very special.

400
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,740
Especially the cracks.

401
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Only the fire can be detected.

402
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,740
The oil must come from a long time.

403
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,740
Continue to fry.

404
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Yes.

405
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
Our peony was hurt.

406
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
There's no wine.

407
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
I have to drink alone.

408
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,740
I'll drink with you.

409
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740

427
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,740
I'll drink with you.

428
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740

434
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740

436
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740

437
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740

I'll drink with you.

470
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
I can't find my boyfriend, either.

471
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
I barely show up.

472
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,740
I'll drive you to him.

473
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
I'll drive you to him.

474
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
I can't find my boyfriend, either.

475
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
I barely show up.

476
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
I barely show up.

477
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
I barely show up.

478
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
During stress complex I'll be there.

479
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
won't forget you.

480
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740

Well?

483
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Is that so?

484
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
Umm...

485
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Good bye.

487
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,520
Wait for me.

488
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Positive stress,

489
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,860
redness,

490
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,900
pain,

00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,740
life JRPF and

492
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,940
지만 они

493
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,740
I think it's time to take the medicine and rest.

494
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Forget it.

495
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Six, seven, eight.

496
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,940
Six, seven, eight.

497
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Six, seven, eight.

498
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Six, seven, eight.

499
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,940
Six, seven, eight.

500
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Come, respectfully call me…

501
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,940
Dear me, come on in, my Ren hydro is there to keep you from melting out in here,

502
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,740
Good self, then come get it.

503
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:56,040
Hey, agent Noye, come and see my half.

504
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Hey, come and see my half.

505
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,540
Hey, let me look.

506
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,940
It's rather fragrant when you'd spot it.

507
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,540
Otherwise you wouldn't have the slightest taste.

508
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
The fire is strong, but it's not greasy.

509
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,540
You should eat more.

510
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,540
The wine is very fragrant.

511
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
It's very tasty.

512
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
It's good for your health.

513
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
It's good that we met each other.

514
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to hold it in.

515
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,540
It's not hard to have a friend who loves you.

516
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
That's right.

517
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
Today's drink is to eat meat better.

518
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Let's drink.

519
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
It's good.

520
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,540
The meat was too smoky.

521
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
If I go back now,

522
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,540
I'll go back to eat it.

523
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
I'll give you a taste.

524
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
It's very tasty.

525
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Then you should eat more.

526
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Jiang Changyang,

527
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
everyone loves the full moon.

528
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,540
But I think

529
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
the full moon is better than the full moon.

530
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
Do you know why?

531
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
Why?

532
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
Because the full moon is round and bright.

533
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,540
It's like a cloud.

534
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
What is it?

535
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
It's like the eyes of a smiling person.

536
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Turn around.

537
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I'll put it on for you.

538
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Don't hit me.

539
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Don't worry.

540
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
It's useful.

541
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
You'll know when you try it.

542
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
I'll go.

543
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Jiang Changyang,

544
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
everyone loves the full moon.

545
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
But I think

546
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
the full moon is better than the full moon.

547
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
Why?

548
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Because it's round and bright.

549
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
You'll know when you try it.

550
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
You'll know when you try it.

551
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
You'll know when you try it.

552
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
You'll know when you try it.

553
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Don't you see?

554
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
You know everything.

555
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
I knew it.

556
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,540
I know it.

557
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,540
I know the full moon.

558
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
I know everything.

559
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
You'll know when you try it.

560
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
You'll know when you try it.

561
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
You'll know when you try it.

562
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
Jiang Changyang,

563
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
everyone loves the full moon.

564
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,540
But I think

565
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Give it to me.

566
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Yes.

567
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,540
A flower bird and a fish.

568
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,540
This book and the jade hairpin look like a pair.

569
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
For the general?

570
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
How is it?

571
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
It's good.

572
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,540
The gifts that the flower bird usually receives are all good luck.

573
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,540
I'm afraid it doesn't look like the usual white jade.

574
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,540
They say the black jade is the best.

575
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,540
He doesn't care if the jade is good or not.

576
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,540
What matters is the intention.

577
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
You're right.

578
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,540
But I've never given him any serious gifts.

579
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,540
It's strange to give him this.

580
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
How come?

581
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,540
You're always so busy with business.

582
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,540
It's strange to see you so busy these days.

583
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,540
General, you're a good person and a good flower.

584
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,540
It's also good for your husband to give you a hairpin.

585
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,540
But I have to go to see the carpenter.

586
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,540
Dafu, give this hairpin to him for me.

587
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
Okay.

588
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Look, the general received a flower in his heart.

589
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Dafu, Dafu, the carpenter is injured.

590
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Go back and see him.

591
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Is it serious?

592
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Can you take him to the doctor?

593
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I've asked Xiaoshun to see him.

594
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,540
I don't know what the injury is.

595
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
Dafu, go and see him.

596
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I'll give you the hairpin.

597
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
Okay.

598
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
Let's go.

599
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,540
By the way, Liu Lang, tell the general that this is the new hairpin.

600
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Don't let him down.

601
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Don't worry, I'll pass it to him.

602
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Thank you.

603
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Let's go.

604
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,540
The carpenter is a man of character.

605
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,540
How could he give me a gift?

606
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,540
I'm grateful to you for saving the flower.

607
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
Thank you.

608
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
I have something to say.

609
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,540
I have to express my feelings.

610
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
You're very thoughtful.

611
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
You'll understand.

612
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Thank you.

613
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
I understand.

614
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,540
I see.

615
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,540
The hairpin is a thing that can be used to break the love.

616
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,540
The hairpin is a thing that can be used to break the love.

617
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Did he notice my feelings?

618
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,540
I want to end this year with this.

619
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,540
The government hasn't found the person who set the fire yet.

620
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,540
They even said that we were careless and lost the fire.

621
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,540
I don't know what to do.

622
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I don't know what to do.

623
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
We lost the fire because of careless actions.

624
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,540
We can see the traces of the black oil on the ruins.

625
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,540
Are the eyes of the people blind?

626
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,540
The government can't count on it.

627
00:34:45,540 --> 00:35:01,480
We have to eat the

628
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,540
the flowers.

629
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:13,540
The flowers that the general saved are still growing.

630
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
Only these flowers haven't been caught by the fire.

631
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,540
I'll find someone to deal with it.

632
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
I'll find someone to deal with it.

633
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,540
I'll find someone to deal with it.

634
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,540
I'll find someone to deal with it.

635
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Let's eat.

636
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,140
Da Ning, come on.

637
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,740
Come on, give me some sauce.

638
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,140
Look,

639
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,140
it's a toothache.

640
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
It's really a toothache.

641
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
It's true.

642
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,940
The flower has been burned.

643
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,540
The branch looks like a dead tree.

644
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,940
I thought it was dead.

645
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,740
I've eaten so many flowers

646
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,140
for the sake of the new flower.

647
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,540
I can't even keep them alive.

648
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,740
I didn't expect

649
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,340
the fire to be so strong

650
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,740
that the wet season is over.

651
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,140
The spring is so rich and ripe.

652
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,340
But I'm so happy with the flowers.

653
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,940
The flower blooms when the flower is not in the flower.

654
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,540
How about

655
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,140
the flower blooms when the flower is not in the flower?

656
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,740
Good, good.

657
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
Good name.

658
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,540
Our family is really blessed.

659
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,140
We're so lucky to have this flower.

660
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Good.

661
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,940
Do you want some more tea?

662
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
No.

663
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,940
Mudan.

664
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
Xuexi.

665
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,140
I want to ask you for a favor.

666
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
So you came.

667
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,940
Come on, sit down.

668
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,740
How's your recovery?

669
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,940
I'm almost recovered.

670
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,140
What's the matter?

671
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm about to have a birthday.

672
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,140
I want to spend it in my mansion.

673
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,740
Can you help me with the banquet?

674
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,940
The garden is on fire.

675
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,740
The fire is still burning.

676
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,540
It's good to have you

677
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,540
to take care of the business.

678
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,740
It's a great honor.

679
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,740
Thank you for your kindness.

680
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,340
I'll do my best.

681
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
What flower did you bring?

682
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,940
But you're dead.

683
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,540
I'm not dead.

684
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
You saved this flower.

685
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,140
The heart has grown out of the soil.

686
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,340
I named it the jade of the Jiao valley.

687
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,540
It can bloom in the after-life.

688
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,940
It's as bright as the sun.

689
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
If I'm still alive in the after-life,

690
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
I can see this scene.

691
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,740
I came here

692
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,540
to thank you again.

693
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
And

694
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,740
you received my gift.

695
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,540
I didn't hesitate.

696
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,540
I thought for a long time

697
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,740
and finally chose it.

698
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,940
You...

699
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,540
Do you understand?

700
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,740
Of course I understand.

701
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
Recently people are busy at work.

702
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,340
I'm afraid I can only come back when I'm off duty.

703
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,940
Fang Yuan is busy.

704
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,740
Don't worry about me.

705
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,340
We're busy.

706
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,740
It's good to have a free-spirited person

707
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
to talk to you like before.

708
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,740
I wish you could be like before

709
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
Okay

710
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Mudan

711
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740
I know you are fake

712
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
You don't have to act in front of me

713
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,740
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable because of me

714
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
Xuexi noticed it carefully

715
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
I didn't hide it

716
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
I believe in her

717
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
Don't worry

718
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
I will keep your secret

719
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,740
Thank you, Xuexi

720
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,740
So what are you fighting for?

721
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,740
Just tell me what you want to say

722
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I have made it clear

723
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
You are smart

724
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
You will understand me

725
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,740
I have something to do in the garden

726
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,740
You can talk

727
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
I will go back

728
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
I will go back

729
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,740
I have asked around

730
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,740
The general brought the old hairpin that Miss Xiao gave years ago

731
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
She has been wearing it for a long time

732
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
She didn't have time to change it

733
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Don't worry

734
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,740
I will let her change it

735
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
Drink water

736
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,740
I misunderstood

737
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,740
I shouldn't have given her the hairpin

738
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Miss Xiao is an outsider

739
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
She can be the general's wife

740
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
But you asked her to do it

741
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,740
What a shame

742
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,740
It's not her

743
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,740
It's Xuexi

744
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
She has done a lot for us

745
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,740
She gave us 500 crowns for a banquet

746
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,740
The money is enough to repair the garden

747
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,740
We should be careful

748
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
We can't let her down

749
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,740
You can't put it on like this

750
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,740
You should put every flower neatly

751
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,740
It looks like a carpet

752
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,740
Look

753
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
You can't leave too many gaps

754
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,740
These purple flowers are from Jiangnan

755
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
They can live for a few days

756
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,740
It's a pity that you took them to the ground

757
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
Are all the nobles so luxurious?

758
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,740
You can't say that

759
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
We have taken the money from the people

760
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,740
We can't leave the flowers to the people

761
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
You can't say that

762
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,740
We have taken the money from the people

763
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
We can't leave the flowers to the people

764
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,740
We can't leave the flowers to the people

765
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,740
We can't leave the flowers to the people

766
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
Sisters, take a break

767
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,740
I brought some tea

768
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,740
Let's go, take a break

769
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Okay

770
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
Do you want to drink some water?

771
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,740
Thank you, Mistress

772
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
No, no need

773
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,740
Thank you

774
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,740
Let's go

775
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Thank you, Sixth Wolf

776
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
I asked Ah Hui

777
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
No wonder she wanted to use so many flowers

778
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,740
The reason why she wants to use so many flowers

779
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,740
is that she wants to break the rules

780
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
of the general

781
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,740
She said that

782
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
the general might not agree

783
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Excuse me

784
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,740
Is that the broken house next to the garden?

785
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,740
The broken house?

786
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
That's our residence

787
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
What's wrong?

788
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Are you the sword makers in the palace?

789
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,740
Is the general's mansion going to be repaired?

790
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,740
Yes

791
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Miss Xiao likes the pavilion

792
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,740
The Princess Royal sent us to take a look

793
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
She said that she would tear down the broken house next to the garden

794
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
and dig out the water

795
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,740
and build a water pavilion

796
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
to reward Miss Xiao

797
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,740
The End
