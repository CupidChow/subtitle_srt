00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,220
и

20
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,320
это

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,140
slime

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,760
также

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,880
но

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
она

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
даже

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
What's wrong with you?

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I just don't want to be seen by you.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Jia Changyang, let me tell you.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Since I signed the first contract with you,

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I've been in the same pit with you.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
No matter what happens, I'll be with you.

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't touch her!

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Let go!

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Let go!

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Let go!

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Don't touch her!

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Don't touch her!

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Zhang Qiufeng, I'm young and half-died.

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I spend my days with the saint.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
How dare you touch me?

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
You've done too much wrong.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
It's hard for the saint to forgive you.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
The saint has already written the edict.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
You should be punished for it!

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm just...

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm just...

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
The young king of Guanglu Temple

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
and the flower-flying stone, Jiang Changyang

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
have been removed from office,

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
and the imperial guards have been taken away.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
The evidence is clear.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm sorry for the pain and suffering of the past years.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
I can't stand it.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm sorry for the corruption of the law,

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
the corruption of the law

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
and the corruption of the property.

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm sorry for the corruption of the law,

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
but I'll pay you back.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Take it off.

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Jiang Changyang, take the edict.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm innocent!

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You're a scumbag!

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
You even have the treasure of the Qi Zhen,

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
and the 500,000 yuan.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
How dare you call the court?

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I've earned half of it.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
The other half is the bribery of the officials.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I can accept the bribery.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
But I can't accept the corruption of the law.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I can't accept it.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
By the way,

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
the officials have been

73
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
hitting on every official.

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:18,560
I need to

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,800
take down the officials of the court.

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
You dig, bitch.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
So you're here to insult others?

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Do you have any proof?

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
You'll know when you check it out

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,200
The Emperor is a traitor!

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,000
The Emperor is a traitor!

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,600
The Emperor is a traitor!

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
The Emperor is a traitor!

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
You don't need to say anything

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
The Emperor will be punished

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Go

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
You're a traitor!

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Go

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Go

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,400
I've been working so hard for all these years

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Stop it

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Stop it

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Stop it

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Stop it

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Stop it

96
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Stop it

97
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Stop it

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Stop it

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Stop it

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Stop it

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Stop it

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Stop it

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Stop it

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Stop it

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
He, you're a good man

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Why do you have to be treated like this?

107
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
He's just a concubine

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
He's a snake

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
He's not a good person

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Dad, my aunt's illness

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
was cured by the Wu Yongtang of He Tianzhu's family

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
He Tianzhu, you should leave Jiang Changyang

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
or you'll be implicated by him

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm sorry

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
No matter what others say

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
in He Weifang's eyes

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
you're just a match for me

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Let's go home

120
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Stop it

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Stop it

122
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Stop it

123
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Stop it

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Stop it

125
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Stop it

126
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Stop it

127
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Stop it

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Stop it

129
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Stop it

130
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
The people of Xinghui

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
are all from the family

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Each move involves the whole game

133
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
You don't understand the principle

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
that a man is better than a ghost

135
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
when he's a man, do you?

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Jiang Changyang's last face

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
was to make you cut off his back

138
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
not to let you step on his face

139
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Now he's been rebelled

140
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
and implicated the king

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I didn't expect

142
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
that Jiang Changyang would be so rude

143
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
that he wouldn't let others live in peace

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
even if he lost the position

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
He didn't want to offend the family and the king

146
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
But the whole city knew about this case

147
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
and the Chu Chiyu army

148
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
got the people's approval

149
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
and the king's reputation

150
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
was saved

151
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
and he was not harmed

152
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Come in

153
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Zhang Qiuxiong's power

154
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
is a sign of power

155
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
It's a sign of power

156
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
The people think you're a minister of the Ministry of Revenue

157
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
and the court officials can't control you

158
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
The Ministry of Revenue

159
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
is still the most important thing

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
and the most important thing

161
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
It's a sign of power

162
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
and the people who are loyal and capable

163
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
should be the most important

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
It's useless to be a minister

165
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
It's up to you

166
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
whether you can be the minister

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
or not

168
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Thank you, Your Majesty

169
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
The contract is short

170
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
but our relationship

171
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
may still be a problem

172
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
for your business

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
How about...

174
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
If I leave you now

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
I'll be a bad person

176
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
in the eyes of others

177
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I won't be a bad person

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
in the eyes of others

179
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Hold on

180
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
There are too many people

181
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
who rely on you to eat

182
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You should put the overall situation first

183
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
The overall situation is

184
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
that there are few people

185
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
who come to me

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
to buy flowers

187
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
But my business is still booming

188
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Flower Manor and the Book Store

189
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
are mostly used by

190
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
the people of the Wu Mei family

191
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
And the Wu Yongtang

192
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
is made by the female doctors

193
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
and the poor medicine

194
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
You won't be affected in any way

195
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
That's good

196
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
What's good?

197
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
People who are good officers

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,420
are all

199
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,420
poor and poor

200
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,420
And you

201
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,420
are just a nobody

202
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,420
and you are being beaten and killed by the people

203
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,420
What did I do?

204
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
The Third Wolf knows

205
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,420
The teacher knows

206
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
You know too

207
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
You always tell me

208
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
half of it and half of it

209
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I dare not say that I'm treating you

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm afraid that they will be worried

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm also hiding

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I'm not treating you

213
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Can I be the same as them?

214
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Don't hide it from me anymore

215
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,420
Zhang Qiufeng is our man

216
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
Since you can't get rid of the suspicion of the King of Ning

217
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,420
you gave up yourself

218
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
and let Zhang Qiufeng take the throne

219
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
It's not just for him

220
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
The Sixth Department

221
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
and the 13th Department

222
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
are all corrupt

223
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
and the people of the Wu Mei family

224
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,420
are all corrupt

225
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
I will be involved in the case

226
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
of the 13th and 30th officials

227
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Soon I will be executed

228
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
There is a

229
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
governor who is searching for the saint

230
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
and he will take the throne

231
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
and he will take the responsibility

232
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
The great cause is important

233
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,420
but your safety is also important

234
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
Have you ever thought

235
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
what if the King of Ning

236
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,420
is really scared to death and uses the Mingyuan

237
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
to kill you?

238
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
What do you think?

239
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
The King of Ning won't

240
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
He is too cruel to me

241
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
and his people will suffer

242
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Besides, I gave him a lot of food

243
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,420
and he has no evidence to prove my suspicions

244
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Now he is just

245
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
threatening me

246
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,420
You have no money

247
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
and it's not convenient for you to work for the Third Wolf

248
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
If you have any action

249
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,420
you should tell me in advance

250
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,420
I have a business team

251
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
and I will go to Chang'an

252
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
You have already entered the Wu Yongtang

253
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
and the court is still

254
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
in a good place

255
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Jiang Changyang

256
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Do you have to be so

257
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
distant between us?

258
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Jiang Changyang

259
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
Jiang Changyang

260
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Jiang Changyang

261
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
Jiang Changyang

262
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420
I am the King of Ning

263
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Jiang Changyang

264
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,420
If you have a reason

265
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
to kill me

266
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
Why hasn't he come yet?

267
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,420
Don't rush. Wait a little longer.

268
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
The person is set!

269
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
He's here.

270
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Let's go.

271
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,420
What's going on?

272
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Madam was supposed to be in a bad state.

273
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
But when Xixi told me that she had a plan,

274
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,420
she left the Pei family.

275
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
But she still didn't put the painting in the water.

276
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
And let Pei Zhong drown.

277
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
You forgot to give Lian Zhou to Pei Zhong.

278
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Now that he's dead, Pei Zhong treats her like this.

279
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Madam begged the king when she was just his wife.

280
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
But there are too many women who died like this.

281
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
All of them are like this.

282
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
They all go to the grave.

283
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
No one cares about them.

284
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Why?

285
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
Why am I always one step behind?

286
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Why?

287
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
I can't save you.

288
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I'm a woman.

289
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
I can't be the only one.

290
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
The End

291
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,420
The End

292
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Lian Zhou, this...

293
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,420
is better than the death of a man.

294
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,420
Madam,

295
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
you're free now.

296
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
You can finally reunite with your parents.

297
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Lian Zhou,

298
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I wish you a long and happy life.

299
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
And a long life.

300
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
Take care, sir.

301
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
Lian Zhou,

302
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
I didn't mean to hurt you.

304
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,420
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
She went to the Pei Village.

312
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
It's hard to get her back.

313
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
We made a deal a few days ago.

314
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
When she escaped from the Pei Village,

315
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
she could live freely.

316
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
Whether it's a saint,

317
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
a nun,

318
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
or Lian Zhou,

319
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
I couldn't save them.

320
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
There are few people

321
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
who can be saved by Wu Yong Tang.

322
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
You're not a deity.

323
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Why are you so hard on yourself?

324
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Yes.

325
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Life is unpredictable.

326
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
People are fragile.

327
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
So,

328
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
we should cherish the people in front of us.

329
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Don't we?

330
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
What a coincidence!

331
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Happy birthday!

332
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Happy birthday to Boss!

333
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
I burned myself.

334
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
It's not desde f Folio.

335
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
Wait.

336
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
I'll be back.

337
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,020
Liulang, you have something to hide from me?

338
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
No.

339
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,660
You have been persuading me to move out of Jiangfu.

340
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,380
But now you not only call Jiang Changyang brother-in-law,

341
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,860
but also ask him to visit me.

342
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
To be honest,

343
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,860
did you do something behind my back?

344
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,860
Do you remember that White Jade Zan?

345
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
I remember.

346
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,020
Liulang, you shouldn't do this.

347
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
In this world, apart from my sister and mother,

348
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
you're the only one who treats me well.

349
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,020
I don't want to see you cry because of Jiang Changyang.

350
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,220
I don't want you to leave me one day.

351
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,220
I said I would take care of you for Shengyi.

352
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I've always been your sister.

353
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,220
How could I abandon you?

354
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Likewise,

355
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
it's because I'm your sister.

356
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,220
If you make a mistake, I'll be responsible for it.

357
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Liulang,

358
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
you need to be sincere in your relationships.

359
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,220
You need to use the best means to get what you want.

360
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
There will be a day when you'll lose everything.

361
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
Do you understand?

362
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
I do.

363
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
Since you're afraid,

364
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,220
why did you tell Jiang Changyang about this?

365
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
That day, my sister was kidnapped.

366
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,220
She took me to the capital.

367
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,220
She was bleeding all the way and didn't bite me.

368
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,220
She even asked me to wipe the blood on the horse's back.

369
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
She was afraid that I'd feel guilty.

370
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
I saw it clearly.

371
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
I'm not afraid of anything.

372
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
I saw it clearly.

373
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
She really cared about you.

374
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,220
She told me the truth.

375
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
She told me to tell you in person.

376
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,220
I was so worried that she was so worried.

377
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Liulang is a kind person.

378
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
She will repay you.

379
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Now, she knows her mistake and she will change it.

380
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,220
I've already taken this matter into account.

381
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,220
But don't do anything stupid again.

382
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Also, if you find out that Jiang Changyang is bleeding again,

383
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
don't tell him about it.

384
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
Yes.

385
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Brother-in-law comforted me before.

386
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,220
He said you wouldn't kidnap me.

387
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,220
He knows you better than anyone else.

388
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,220
Now that you know the consequences, don't be sad.

389
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Brother-in-law really cares about you.

390
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
I know.

391
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
Drink your tea.

392
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
What did you say?

393
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,220
I said I wanted to learn martial arts.

394
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Anyway, your father is at home.

395
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Why don't you teach me?

396
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,220
You have no foundation.

397
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
You have no master.

398
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,220
You're just a lazy teacher.

399
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
Watch this!

400
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
How can I learn this?

401
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,220
Who said I can't learn?

402
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,220
When you taught me to play the bow, you praised me.

403
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,220
Besides, I'm not a girl who doesn't go out.

404
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
I used to be a teacher.

405
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Why can't I learn martial arts?

406
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
You've been teaching since you were a kid.

407
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
I'm not finished.

408
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Can you save yourself from the punishment?

409
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Okay.

410
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
But I didn't tell you in advance.

411
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
You're a kid.

412
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,220
You can't avoid punishment.

413
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Don't worry. Who am I?

414
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
I'm He Weifang.

415
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
I'm not afraid of suffering.

416
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Forward!

417
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Right hand, attack!

418
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,220
Left hand, attack the abdomen!

419
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
No!

420
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
Your lower body is unstable.

421
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Why don't you change a simple move?

422
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
Who said my lower body is unstable?

423
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
You've been practicing for half a day.

424
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Have some tea.

425
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
Okay.

426
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
By the way,

427
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
the hairpin that the six-wolf broke,

428
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,220
do you still have it?

429
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm a very clumsy person.

430
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,220
You'd better return the hairpin to me.

431
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,220
I asked someone to put it on the street.

432
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Whether it's a belt or a bag,

433
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
it's not a waste.

434
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,220
I've already thrown away the hairpin.

435
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Since it's a square,

436
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
it's not a waste.

437
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
I don't want to throw it away.

438
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Since it's a gift for saving the fire,

439
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
I'll take it.

440
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
You don't have to waste it.

441
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Throw it away.

442
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,220
It's cold in the spring.

443
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,220
Why did you stab the cage?

444
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Come in.

445
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Jiang Cheng Yang,

446
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,220
the floor in my room is broken.

447
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
It's too cold.

448
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
I want to stay here for a night.

449
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
It's not cold anymore.

450
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
You should rest early.

451
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
I'll sleep in the room.

452
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Wait.

453
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Everyone in the mansion knows that I came here.

454
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
If you leave me here alone,

455
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,220
everyone will suspect us.

456
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
What?

457
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
What's wrong?

458
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm not a good person.

459
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
I'm not a good person.

460
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Are you shy?

461
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,220
You've played so many scenes in the show.

462
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Are you afraid of this one?

463
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220
Of course not.

464
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
You should sleep first.

465
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I'll read the book.

466
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
Did Xue Xin write to you?

467
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,220
I don't know.

468
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,220
I don't know how she's doing.

469
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
Sometimes there's no news.

470
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
It's good news.

471
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,220
When she left,

472
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
she gave me a secret gift.

473
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
Do you know what it is?

474
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I don't want to get involved

475
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
in the secret between you two.

476
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
You don't want to?

477
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
I don't dare.

478
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
You've been dancing and dancing in the morning.

479
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Aren't you tired?

480
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Go to sleep.

481
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
It's so bright here.

482
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
How can I rest?

483
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
You can sleep in peace now.

484
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
I'll read the book.

485
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Wait.

486
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
You're reading so late.

487
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Are you blind?

488
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Okay, let's sleep together.

489
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
I won't take advantage of you.

490
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
What are you afraid of?

491
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
What are you looking at?

492
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
There's nothing on it.

493
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,220
Jiang Changyang,

494
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
if you can't sleep,

495
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
why don't we talk like last time

496
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,220
in the palace?

497
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
You're so talkative.

498
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
You have to go to the palace tomorrow to see the Third Master.

499
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
Why don't you go to the hospital?

500
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Stop it.

501
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
You've opened the window.

502
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,220
The heat has gone.

503
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
Didn't Xiaochun

504
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,220
take care of you?

505
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
You're so fat.

506
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Remember to soak yourself in soup.

507
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,220
Jiang Changyang,

508
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
I really want to see

509
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
the lights

510
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
that light up the sky.

511
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
They must be more beautiful

512
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
than the full moon at noon.

513
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
Okay, let's sleep.

514
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
You're so shameless.

515
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
You've disappointed me.

516
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
As long as Your Majesty can calm down,

517
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
even if you beat me to death today,

518
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
I'm willing to do it.

519
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
You're just a man

520
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
who humiliated you.

521
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Although I'm not a flower,

522
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
I still miss Your Majesty every day.

523
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220
I'll work hard to fight against the evil.

524
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
I'll make my country a better place.

525
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,220
I've found a good fight for Your Majesty.

526
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
I'll make you a good man.

527
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Your Majesty,

528
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,220
I've found a good fight for Your Majesty.

529
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
I'll make you a good man.

530
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Your Majesty,

531
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
may I have a look?

532
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
It's rare that you still have this heart.

533
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Bring me two cups of tea.

534
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
Yes.

535
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Ts seva,

536
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Ride is dead.

537
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
If aime title

538
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
I would like to promote

539
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
one more thing.

540
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
You mean

541
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
him to be a major hero like

542
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
the popular Minister of State and corruption?

543
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
All let you go!

544
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,220
Take care of her.

545
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
I want to taste the peony.

546
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
I want to taste the lemon tea.

547
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
I want to taste it now.

548
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
They were

549
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
killed by the King of Ning.

550
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
What?

551
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
The King of Ning wanted to use the death of Lu Shilang's family to kill Zhao Zhen.

552
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
I should have sent his wife and children to Chang'an before the incident.

553
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
At first, I was afraid that he would be killed.

554
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
I was afraid that he would be killed.

555
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,220
I didn't expect that the King of Ning would kill him so easily.

556
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
Zhaizhen,

557
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I don't want to wait any longer.

558
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
Our people will be in the army.

559
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,220
As long as we can control them,

560
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,220
and proceed smoothly,

561
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,220
the war will be over after the spring.

562
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
The war will be over.

563
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,220
Will it be over soon?

564
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,220
General,

565
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,220
we are still in power.

566
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,220
We still have a long way to go.

567
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,220
We can't wait any longer.

568
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
If we wait any longer,

569
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
I'm afraid that the King of Ning will send his men to the court again.

570
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
The army of the Zhe'er and Hedong

571
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
will be here.

572
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,220
We will be safe.

573
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,220
The late emperor is coming.

574
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
General Yu and the late emperor are in the same boat.

575
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Now the border is peaceful.

576
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
He will send the late emperor back to the capital

577
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
to report the peace.

578
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
We will be safe.

579
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
We will be safe.

580
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
We will be safe.

581
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,220
Yes.

582
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Are you worried about

583
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Mudan's safety?

584
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
Before the war,

585
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I will send her away.

586
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
I will protect her.

587
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
You have known her for a long time.

588
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
You must know her past.

589
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Why does she always

590
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
turn people away from her?

591
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Why does she always face everything alone?

592
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
Have you ever

593
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
mentioned Princess Shouchang?

594
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
When she was young,

595
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
she was treated as a mother.

596
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,220
Now she has lost her mother.

597
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,220
She is more stubborn.

598
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
She is more stubborn.

599
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Every time she fights with people,

600
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Princess Shouchang will protect her.

601
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
In her heart,

602
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
Princess Shouchang is her elder sister

603
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
and her closest relative.

604
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Is the death of Princess

605
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
also related to Shouchang?

606
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
She is not the culprit.

607
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
But she is still

608
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
in a bad state.

609
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
She is in a bad state.

610
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Mengzhou was hit by a natural disaster.

611
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
She has a few villages in Anwei.

612
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,220
The three sons of the Crown Prince

613
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
and Princess Shouchang

614
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
are trying to help.

615
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,220
The person responsible for the disaster

616
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
was King Ning.

617
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
King Ning reported the disaster in time.

618
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,220
The victims were saved.

619
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,220
But when they arrived in Mengzhou,

620
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
they found that Mengzhou was

621
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
a hell.

622
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
The people were furious.

623
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
They wanted to punish the local officials.

624
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,220
They were afraid that they would expose their identities.

625
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
They wanted to prove that

626
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,220
the local government should be punished.

627
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
They suggested that they should secretly search for evidence

628
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
and hand over to the Dali Temple.

629
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
The corrupt officials were in a hurry.

630
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
But they didn't know

631
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,220
that their actions had already been exposed.

632
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,220
King Ning sent people

633
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
to disguise themselves as victims

634
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,220
and set a fire.

635
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
They tried to save the three sons

636
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
but failed to save Princess Shouchang.

637
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,220
They watched the Princess

638
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220
and ate her alive.

639
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
Execute!

640
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
The most powerful person

641
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
was the one who made the Queen suffer.

642
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
The Princess was accused of the disaster

643
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
and was pushed by King Ning

644
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
to the innocent victims.

645
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
They said that they were trying to steal the food

646
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
and set a fire.

647
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
The Princess was involved.

648
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
The Princess and the victims

649
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,220
were so guilty

650
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
that they were killed in front of her.

651
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
They were so afraid of the corrupt officials

652
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
and they hated them.

653
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
So

654
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
from that moment on

655
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
she decided to be a flower-bird

656
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
who was going to fill the world.

657
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,220
No wonder

658
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
she was so afraid of fire.

659
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
She was sorry

660
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
because she knew that the King's family

661
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
was the reason for her loss.

662
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
She deserved nothing.

663
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
But I can see

664
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
that she loved you.

665
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
And because of this love

666
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
she was afraid of something.

667
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Because she was afraid that you would

668
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
be involved with the innocent

669
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
like Princess Shouchang.

670
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
But I was not afraid.

671
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
She has been holding out for so many years.

672
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,500
It's enough.

673
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm here.

674
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,740
I won't let him suffer anymore.

675
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:29,440
The

676
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
I have something to tell you.

677
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Your music school is not open.

678
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
You have to go around every time.

679
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
You should take a rest.

680
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
I'm tired today.

681
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
I won't go.

682
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Goodbye.

683
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
I'm tired.

684
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
From now on, we have no obstacles.

685
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Jia Changyang,

686
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
my love for you is irreplaceable.

687
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,440
It's inevitable.

688
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,440
You said,

689
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
if I had a problem,

690
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
you would come to help me.

691
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
But you know,

692
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm in love with you

693
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
not because you can protect me,

694
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
but because you are the shameless Jiang Changyang.

695
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
You are righteous,

696
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
but you have already completed your mission.

697
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
You have to do it.

698
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
You have to do it.

699
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
You have to do it.

700
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
You have to do it.

701
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
You are righteous,

702
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
but you have already completed your mission.

703
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
You have become

704
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
my favorite character.

705
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
You have already told me

706
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
all your hardships.

707
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
You have already told me all your hardships.

708
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
If I keep saying this,

709
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
I will be a living hell for you.

710
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,800
I understand.

711
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Your plan is very dangerous.

712
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,440
So you dare not come near me.

713
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
But I'm not afraid.

714
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,760
No matter how many steps you take,

715
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,680
whether it's good or bad,

716
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,840
I'll come to you.

717
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,880
Even if Jiang Changyang will kill you?

718
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
From now on,

719
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,160
we're not the only ones.

720
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,640
We'll be a real couple.

721
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,800
We'll be real family.

722
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,880
When everything is peaceful,

723
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,720
I'll be with you.

724
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,240
When I was young,

725
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,400
I thought I could protect many people.

726
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,280
We wouldn't be brothers.

727
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,040
But in lost fight zero.

728
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,480
Finally, they die in vain.

729
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,040
I had no realistic conclusion

730
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,200
on what to do.

731
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Why can't Siyu and Dayi fight?

732
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Jiang Changyang,

733
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
why don't you dare to try?

734
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
The world is vast.

735
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Why should I fight?

736
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm not afraid of anything.

737
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm not afraid of anything.

738
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm not afraid of anything.

739
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Leave me.

740
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I want to change the world.

741
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
This is the day when I can be in the country.

742
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Jiang Changyang, I tell you,

743
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
I will not give up.

744
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
I'm not afraid of death.

745
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
But I'm afraid.

746
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
I'm afraid of death.

747
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
The End

748
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
The End

749
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
The End

750
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
The End

751
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
The End

752
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
The End

753
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
The End
