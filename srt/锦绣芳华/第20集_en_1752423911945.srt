The fate of his age is notTo let without brotherhood something

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Regarding theouth dreams

14
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,920
and the Chinese enshrines

15
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
layman

16
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
I thank my people

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
one is rebelled

18
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,840
One always tell the truth

19
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,400
As women, including men

20
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
required to affirm their composers

21
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,300
I am not, I just do

22
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,600
as an honor

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
No!

24
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
He's a traitor.

25
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,100
If you take another step forward, you're a sinner.

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Have you thought it through?

27
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
Saint combatant.

28
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
Cease fire.

29
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,360
Stupid.

30
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
Fire.

31
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,920
S FEW MONTHS LATER

32
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,980
Turn off the light.

33
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
I have a husband now.

34
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,880
I hope Liu Jun can be self-sufficient.

35
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,720
Jiang Chengniang is dead.

36
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,360
A traitor can become a official slave.

37
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
He Wei Bao,

38
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440
only I can help you.

39
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
In the future, if you want to live,

40
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,680
you can do as you like.

41
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,640
Listen to me.

42
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
From today on,

43
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Chi Yu, Zhu,

44
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,400
you will be on this stage.

45
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
I will come to see you every day.

46
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
Delicious meat.

47
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,400
You two can only help each other.

48
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
Our relationship is the only thing that you and I!

49
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
You're a monster!

50
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,160
What a flag you look like!

51
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Don't hurt yourself.

52
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Give it back to me!

53
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Give it back!

54
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
Sir!

55
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
What's the matter?

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
His Majesty asked you to come over.

57
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Sir, I'm sorry.

58
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Sir!

61
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Help me.

62
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,360
God bless!

63
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Please, Master!

64
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,680
After operations in editing were made, we are sickers.

65
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,760
At least we were recently in the east.

66
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,180
It could be that the Real Pride is in the eldest.

67
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,260
Rather, it can be considered as from above.

68
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,440
The way that the real pride is divided

69
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:49,560
This pro span the

70
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
and he was killed by the military.

71
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
He was killed by the military.

72
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
How could this happen?

73
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
It happened so suddenly.

74
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
The saint was as ungrateful as the general.

75
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Zhang Qian, the head of the new department, was killed.

76
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Fangcai was killed.

77
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
If you have any doubts,

78
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
just ask him.

79
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I will keep my word.

80
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
General Yu,

81
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
General Yu,

82
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
the factory's security

83
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
only found general Yu's sword

84
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
and a few treasures.

85
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm sorry.

86
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Thank you.

87
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I have to thank you.

88
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
The army can't live without a day off.

89
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
General, now is the starting point of the He Dong army.

90
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm just a dragon...

91
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm the god of death.

92
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm the one who's going to restore the country.

93
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Now I'm going back to He Dong

94
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
and take the gun.

95
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I should be a son first,

96
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
then a servant.

97
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
General, you should rest for a while.

98
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Tomorrow morning,

99
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
the saint will send someone to escort you back to He Dong.

100
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
In a few days,

101
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
the army will help the king to change his position.

102
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
The victory will be ours.

103
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm very happy.

104
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
You should do it yourself.

105
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Otherwise, you can't sit here

106
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
and drink tea with me.

107
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Yes.

108
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I will.

109
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I will.

110
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I will.

111
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
I will.

112
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I will.

113
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I will.

114
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
General Liu has moved me

115
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
because all of us have been那個

116
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,440
It's not that I fear death.

117
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I've seen the course of...

118
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I can revenge only if I follow the king.

119
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
A saint could have someone his own,

120
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
no one could put his trust in you.

121
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
You've had more than nine years in the Sims.

122
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
But if you need to work in Perhaps,

123
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
How many years can you live without it?

124
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Lord Liu, I will never let you down.

125
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I've changed a few things in the book.

126
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Please give it to Lord Liu.

127
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Why?

128
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I will never die.

129
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
You are like me.

130
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,440
But the most cruel thing in my life is this kind of self-esteem.

131
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I will never die.

132
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
You are like me.

133
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,440
But the most cruel thing in my life is this kind of self-esteem.

134
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I will never die.

135
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I will never die.

136
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I will never die.

137
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440
I will never die.

138
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Lord Liu, you are the king of the enemy.

139
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Why did you drink the medicine?

140
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm the king.

141
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Look what these people have done.

142
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
They have been holding the sword for more than ten years.

143
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,440
They have been holding the sword for more than ten years.

144
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,440
They have been holding the sword for more than ten years.

145
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
They have been holding the sword for more than ten years.

146
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
If I didn't find out in advance,

147
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I would have been dead.

148
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
You have to be ready to fight.

149
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
You have to be ready to fight.

150
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm really dead.

151
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Now you are the king.

152
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm the leader of the army.

153
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,440
But there are still some people who are stubborn.

154
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
They are waiting for peace.

155
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
The war will soon spread throughout the country.

156
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
We can only do it by force.

157
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Yes.

158
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yu Zheng...

159
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
He is not willing to accept the challenge.

160
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
He is not afraid.

161
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
But there are still some old people.

162
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
The army is strong.

163
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You have to protect the army.

164
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Remember, I want to live up to the order.

165
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,440
I want to live up to the order.

166
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I understand.

167
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
The army is strong.

168
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,440
But the profit cannot be used by the king.

169
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,440
The profit cannot be used by the king.

170
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,440
The army will be the only fire in Chang'an.

171
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
The world is in danger.

172
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Why are there so many soldiers?

173
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
I don't know.

174
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Xiaochun.

175
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Aunt.

176
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
They are leaving.

177
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
They are leaving.

178
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
How can this be?

179
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,440
When we went there, we saw the general and the army.

180
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
We couldn't find Mudan and Chuan.

181
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,440
It's impossible.

182
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Chuan is a good fighter. He won't kill them.

183
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Mudan said he would wait for us.

184
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Maybe they went to some place.

185
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I'll go find them.

186
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
The army is in the area.

187
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I'll go find them.

188
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't go.

189
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Mudan made us leave in advance.

190
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
You are going to die.

191
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
You can't go back on Mudan.

192
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,440
You went out to deliver the goods.

193
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I don't know what happened.

194
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I'll find out when I get there.

195
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm sorry.

196
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I won't do it again.

197
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
I'll go back to Chuan.

198
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm sorry.

199
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm sorry.

200
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm sorry.

201
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I'm sorry.

202
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,440
This place is a blessing for me.

203
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I hope you and Lv Hangtao can continue to work here.

204
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
We'll help you.

205
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
The fire will go out.

206
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Don't let it go out.

207
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
Take care.

208
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
I thought I could help you.

209
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,440
I hope you will not let her down.

210
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,440
It says that if we fail to find the mother,

211
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,440
no one can say that she is dead.

212
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Right?

213
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Yes.

214
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
She is a smart woman.

215
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
She will find a way to escape from heaven.

216
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Let's take care of the shop.

217
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
When she comes back,

218
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
she will be safe.

219
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,440
I am trapped in a dream.

220
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,440
I want to lock everyone up by your side.

221
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
It's so sad.

222
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
So beautiful.

223
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
How did you get hurt like this?

224
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,440
Cut off the hand of the guard.

225
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Yes.

226
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Liu Chang.

227
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
You don't care about yourself.

228
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,440
I have to let my men to get hurt.

229
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
If you can't bear it,

230
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
then it's all over.

231
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
Eat.

232
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,440
What does it smell like?

233
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,440
You've got clean hands.

234
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,940
You use the actual

235
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
ornament.

236
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,440
My mother would still look at me like this even if she took me away.

237
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,440
The days are long. One day I will make you come to me willingly.

238
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
I will invite you to watch more.

239
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

240
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I will come to see you tomorrow.

241
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I love you.

242
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Mother! Mother!

243
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Mother?

244
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Mother!

245
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
You are the owner of the big hall in the Wuyong Hall.

246
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
You are the master of everything.

247
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
You are the dream of the world.

248
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
You will not be trapped here forever.

249
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Mother!

250
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,440
You have really become the moon.

251
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
And we have been together for a long time.

252
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I can never get out of you.

253
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Mother! Mother!

254
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,440
No matter where the moon is, the moonlight is always there.

255
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Mother!

256
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Mother!

257
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Mother!

258
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,900
There was a love poem when we were young.

259
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,520
Theavarus' poem

260
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,060
You said, if you wanted to seduce me to your heart's content,

261
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I sent someone to buy it according to the order.

262
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
Still don't want to talk to me?

263
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,060
This fragrance and fragrance make people feel good.

264
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Does it have a name?

265
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
I don't know.

266
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
This is a gun.

267
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I don't know.

268
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
You really are a ghost.

269
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
We are.

270
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Did you come to send me away?

271
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,060
I advise you not to act rashly.

272
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,060
You see the one you love die in front of you.

273
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
You will live in the endless hell.

274
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,060
You are a spider.

275
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,060
He Weifang, you finally feel my pain.

276
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,060
The hero loves me to the end.

277
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
But I will not give up.

278
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,060
I have a lot of love in my life.

279
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,060
The meaning of my life is not built on anyone.

280
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Why do you keep yourself trapped in pain?

281
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,060
Liu Chang, who loved you, died.

282
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
You should care about yourself now.

283
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,060
Instead of living for another life, why not live to die?

284
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
No one can control this case.

285
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Why did you help me?

286
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
The blood of the whole Chang'an city is too heavy.

287
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I don't like it.

288
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,060
And I have experienced too many false feelings in my life.

289
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,060
Even my father, who loved me, considered me as a chess piece.

290
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Life is also a trap.

291
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
Death is also a trap.

292
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
I can't escape this cage.

293
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Only Zi Shu gave me a pure heart.

294
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
I am destined to be with him in this life.

295
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
I will not die.

296
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Go.

297
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,060
Li You Zhen, I never believe in fate.

298
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,060
So I will fight for myself at any time.

299
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
You can do the same.

300
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,060
No matter when it starts, everything is not over.

301
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Since you let me go today, I hope one day you can let yourself go too.

302
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
The end

303
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,060
Jiang Changyang has been playing for so long.

304
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,060
The rebels of Longluo are not only the ones who are slightly overpowered.

305
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,060
If Your Majesty is willing to reveal a few people,

306
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,060
then the people above can live.

307
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
You can live, but you can't die.

308
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
You can just wander for three thousand miles.

309
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,060
The one who lives with you is not only me.

310
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,060
But all the people in the court who are willing to die.

311
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
You can't kill the loyal subjects.

312
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,060
You can't force me to be a good king.

313
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,060
What are you talking about?

314
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,060
I just want to share your burden.

315
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,060
You have endured so far, but you haven't convinced all the ministers.

316
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
Let me guess.

317
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
The Shuo family has always been friends with you.

318
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,060
You Linhe Dong must have returned to Shun.

319
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
You let Xiao Xuexi leave the capital.

320
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
Did you make any deal with Hexi?

321
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Your Majesty, you need to find out.

322
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,060
I want to know which chess pieces you have.

323
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:07,060
In fact, the best chess piece I have is Your Majesty.

324
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
As long as Your Majesty is in my hands,

325
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,060
whoever is the master of the King of Qin, whoever is the traitor,

326
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,060
they all need to see the decree of the Ministry of State Security.

327
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:25,060
So Your Majesty, before you die, you need to think twice.

328
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Where is he?

329
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,060
Did you kill him?

330
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
You need to take care of this wound.

331
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Don't leave it.

332
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,060
I'm asking you, did you kill him?

333
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,060
You said, if I kill him, you will hate me forever.

334
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
I won't do such a silly thing.

335
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
I just let him go.

336
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
He won't come back.

337
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,060
You should let him go.

338
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
I promised to treat you well.

339
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Didn't I do it?

340
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Why does Li Yuzheng have to break everything?

341
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Why can't he be He Weifang?

342
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
He is not in this world.

343
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Why did you kill him?

344
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
He is not in this world.

345
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Only when he is gone, we can be free.

346
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Father, Li Chen Di has only one step.

347
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
What you should do now is to help him.

348
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
To complete your decree of the Qing Yun.

349
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Don't be obsessed with someone you can't keep.

350
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
Let's live our own life, okay?

351
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,060
How can I keep someone you can't keep?

352
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
I will kill you.

353
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
Who is it? Stop!

354
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
Don't search!

355
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Stop!

356
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Run!

357
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Open the door!

358
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,060
Open the door!

359
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Open the door!

360
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
I've never seen this person.

361
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Search!

362
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
The one behind! Go there!

363
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Did you see this woman?

364
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Stop!

365
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
It's the princess.

366
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
Go there!

367
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Who is it?

368
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
Stop!

369
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
Go!

370
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Stop!

371
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
How's it?

372
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
No movie.

373
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,060
NCII saw this person.

374
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Search his body!

375
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Sasha! Here is pieces of scrap wood!

376
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
rails against each other!

377
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Chase them!

378
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:46,040
The

379
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,120
what kind of workout you like to do.

380
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,540
The tea house inistäugurado has been locked up

381
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,100
for a long time, and no one knows what to do.

382
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,160
My C Ты prepares so well,

383
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,160
But no matter how smart you are, you still can't escape from my palm.

384
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Good boy.

385
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Stop it.

386
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Go back with me.

387
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,160
How do you know that I'm hiding here,

388
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
instead of asking you to enter the palace?

389
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,160
If it wasn't for the late princess Zulan, I would have already taken your life.

390
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Since you don't know how to cherish me,

391
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,160
I would have been buried with you today.

392
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,160
How can you kill me alone?

393
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
The guards of Suizhi have been everywhere.

394
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
I've already met them.

395
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
And now, in the rain outside the window,

396
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,160
I've already met them.

397
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
As long as I'm drunk,

398
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,160
I'll break through the window and enter.

399
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
The wind blows in the mountains.

400
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160

The moon is shining.

419
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
The moon is shining.

420
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,160
The moon is shining.

421
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
The moon is shining.

422
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
The moon is shining.

423
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,160
