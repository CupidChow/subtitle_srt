Dmitry Fomenko

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
impressive

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Team

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's wrong, Mudan? Did you cut your hand? Let me see.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's okay. It'll be fine in a while.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Did you see the clouds?

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So delicate.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll go and check.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll go and check.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll go and check.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I need to make a pattern.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When the pattern is done,

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can print the clouds on the sachet.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And put a good meaning on it.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You didn't know before

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that you can do it.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My mother taught me.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mudan, now the square is

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
covered with the red color of your fork.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the lady in the heaven

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
will be proud of you.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If I can't have an enemy,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
how can I bear the expectation of my mother?

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Jiang Changyang came to the square today to find you.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Liulang said you were in a bad mood and didn't want to see the guest.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So he threw her away.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I thought

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I knew him well enough

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to get along with him for a long time.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I knew his feelings for Wu Bo.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But I didn't expect

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that in front of Master and A'Fei,

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
he would actually protect a murderer.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't understand.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was also surprised.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was afraid that Jiang Changyang

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
was a short-tempered man.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He was nice to us before.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we forgot that

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he was a bird-fisher.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He was a corrupt official.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I forgot that

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
he was good at acting.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let the past be the past.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wu Bo is a poor man.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wu Dan,

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
let it go.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All these years,

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wu Bo has been suffering.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He has been atonement.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Little lady.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wu Bo,

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
don't say anything.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not only Jiang Changyang,

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
why did Wu Bo seem so calm when he saw me?

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It seemed that he knew that I would go to him.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And my mother.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why didn't she mention this to me?

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The symptoms of severe poisoning and infection are very different.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When I was examined,

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I had to tell the doctor the truth.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When Xunyin was examined,

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
my mother always looked at me.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I must find out the truth.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wu Dan!

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've found out everything you told me to.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wu Bo has been atonement since he returned from Luoyang.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He only met with children.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now he has no other relatives.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This is...

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is the names and ages of all the children in the house.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I only know some of their names.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I need to ask the villagers who live around here.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing with these children?

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to know

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
if any of these children came from Luoyang.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A Kang!

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A Kang!

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why is he not here?

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He comes here every day.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop!

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you A Kang?

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop!

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Where are you going? Does it hurt?

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey!

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let me go!

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Come here!

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let me go!

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's A Kang.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let me go!

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're a thief!

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me go!

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't move!

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Stand still!

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Give it back!

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Give it back!

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A Kang,

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to ask you.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're the most obedient and sensible person in the world.

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why did you hit me today?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You hit me so hard?

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You always give me clothes and food.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're so heartless!

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're a bad person!

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't want your things anymore!

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let go!

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why did you say that?

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're so cruel, Wu Bo!

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I saw it all.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're a big bad person!

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How do you know that it's not Wu Bo?

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wu Bo is a good man.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's my savior.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Slow down!

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You have a fever.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Slow down!

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Drink some water.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing?

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want your things.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If it wasn't for Wu Bo,

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I would have been dead by now.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're the one who's to blame.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're my enemy!

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Akan, tell me.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're talking about the disaster in Luoyang four years ago.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Are you really from Luoyang?

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Many people were killed there.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But only a few people survived.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My parents and my sister

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
were all killed.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I was the only one.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Wu Bo's family was already dead.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He was lucky to get the medicine.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But he was already dead.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He gave me all the medicine when he met me.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's how I got my life back.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So many people died in the disaster.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Akan, tell me.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Where did Wu Bo get the medicine?

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He said he got it from a merchant's house.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Merchant's house?

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I didn't say it, but I'm sure it's not.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are you so sure?

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The medicine wasn't for him.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was expensive.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He needed a rare peony.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They say the biggest medicine shop in the city has this kind of peony.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But the shop owner...

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He sold all the peonies to the rich people.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Did you remember it wrong?

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, I remember it very clearly.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My parents took me and the whole village

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to the pharmacy for a few days.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But they didn't tell me that they used up all the peonies.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I saw them carrying the medicine on their back.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I saw it.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm asking you.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What's the pattern on the medicine bag?

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a cloud.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
A red cloud.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I was hoping that my parents could get a cloud of silver.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But they knelt at the door of the pharmacy and no one understood.

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The people in the village fell one by one.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The village was destroyed.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The land was buried.

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Too many people died.

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Too many.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If we say that the people who were given the peonies were killed,

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the peonies in his hands were poisoned.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It wasn't the devil who killed everyone.

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But it wasn't the murderers who killed people.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It was our enemies.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Stop talking nonsense.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Stop talking nonsense.

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Stop talking nonsense.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Akang.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
After Uncle Wu saved you,

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
why did you come to Chang'an?

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Brother took us here.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To Jiangchangyang?

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I took the medicine.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
At night,

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I woke up in a daze.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I saw him hang himself.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Uncle Wu!

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Brother came in time to save him.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Mother!

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That night, Uncle Wu cried for a long time.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother went away for a long time.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Brother told me that

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I would be his child from now on.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Only when my siblings were safe and sound,

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Uncle Wu could live well.

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The skin of this flower

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
can cool the blood and relieve the pain of the pig.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It can be used to treat the body,

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the body, the body, the body.

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It can relieve the heat of the lungs.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It is the most necessary medicine for this purpose.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The ice crystal peonies we planted

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
are hard to find.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The most valuable.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When the disaster happened,

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
a pearl was worth a thousand gold.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I grew up with my mother.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I know my mother best.

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She is not such a cruel person.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My mother knows medicine.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If someone poisoned her,

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
she would have noticed.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But she knew that Yan Qi did not mention it.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why would she know?

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why would she know?

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I want to go back to Luoyang.

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Coming.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What?

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't go into this house?

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What do you mean?

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Our deal has been settled in Chang'an.

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is it okay?

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you want to go back?

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I came to Luoyang to see my father.

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It has nothing to do with you.

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Get out of the way.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But you are not related to the family.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You should be careful.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't come to the master again.

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Okay?

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mudan.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's really you.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why didn't you come home in advance?

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Come in.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Come.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why did you mention the old things?

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You just told me that my mother fell ill.

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But no one told me that it was a poison.

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why would I think so?

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Your mother is not...

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You don't have to hide it.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I already know.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not my fault.

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why?

256
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You said you would go home to talk to your family.

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But you went to Chang'an to see Mudan.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Are you blaming me?

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You don't look after the He family.

260
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Now they are all gone.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Since Mudan is the daughter of the He family,

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
what's wrong with helping the family?

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Who is she?

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
She is my mother.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't know.

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know.

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know.

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know.

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What's wrong with you?

274
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Who are you to decide?

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mudan, I don't know that it's your money.

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Two years.

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Within two years, I will return it to you.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What do you mean?

279
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why do you want to return it?

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Shut up.

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
As the daughter of the He family,

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it's natural for Mudan to raise her parents well.

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Moreover, she is pregnant now.

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You didn't see that.

285
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She is the owner of the shop.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She deserves a lot of money.

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She is so stingy.

288
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
How can she see it?

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Shut up.

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I...

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Father, I didn't come to ask for money.

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If it wasn't for your notice,

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to find out what happened.

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
How much did you find out?

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A lot.

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Luoyang was in a terrible state.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The ice crystal Mudan that my mother planted could save people's lives.

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Father, did you sell the skin to the high-ranking officials?

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've been thinking on my way here.

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I've been raising my parents since I was a child.

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How could I be a greedy and ungrateful person?

302
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No.

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You can't say that about your mother.

304
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
She doesn't know about this.

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What do you mean?

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm the one who sold the skin to the high-ranking officials.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Your mother doesn't know where the medicine is.

308
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I told her that I had sold the medicine to the people who were infected.

309
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why?

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So that they could make more money?

311
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The disease was so severe that the high-ranking officials were afraid of it.

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They forced me to sell all the medicine to them.

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But after the flood, people drank water and ate.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They were contaminated, which caused the disease.

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The high-ranking officials stayed in their houses all day.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They ate and drank.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They were so poor.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
How could they get sick so easily?

319
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
How could they care about this?

320
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The servants who were bought from the outside,

321
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
if one or two of them got sick,

322
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
they were scared to death.

323
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They were so poor that they couldn't afford to buy medicine.

324
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They were so poor.

325
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They were so poor that they didn't want to save anyone.

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How could they have agreed to this?

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm just a merchant.

328
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If someone is in trouble,

329
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
they will search every shop we have.

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
By then, you and your mother will be involved.

331
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mudeng, I don't dare to take this risk.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So you were hiding it from us.

333
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Your mother was a kind person.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
She loved to eat and drink.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She was young.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's just a worry for you.

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't let you and your mother suffer with me.

338
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't bear it.

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Then mother...

340
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Mother found out later.

341
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wu Hong told me.

342
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
After the disaster, someone was mixed up in the house.

343
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Your mother pitied him.

344
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
She gave him food and money.

345
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This person is Wu Hong.

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
How could this be?

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you take the medicine on time,

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you will recover in a few days.

349
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Only rich people can afford this expensive medicine.

350
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We are poor people.

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How can we afford it?

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The single products of the He's Pharmacy are all out of stock.

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How can we afford it?

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's not fair.

355
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Madam, do you really know the price of this medicine?

356
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Did my single product

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
sell at a high price to the people?

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It doesn't matter if it sells at a high price.

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Your medicine won't sell to ordinary people.

360
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It will be delivered to the rich people.

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How could this be?

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's a good opportunity to make money.

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It seems that the owner of the He's Pharmacy didn't tell you the truth.

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Outside...

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's already dark outside.

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If the He's Pharmacy was full of people half a month ago,

367
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
they would have been begging for a pack of medicine.

368
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But now, those people have already gone to hell.

369
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Among those souls, there is my family.

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I've been wandering outside the house of the nobles for half a month.

371
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But no one is here.

372
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If the owner of the He's Pharmacy was home today,

373
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
he would have driven me away.

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's a good opportunity.

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But I met you.

376
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is what you get.

377
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They would never make this kind of thing.

378
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
So isn't it better to see from outside?

379
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I wanted to avenge my family.

380
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
But who knew that you were the source of this poison.

381
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
But you didn't know it.

382
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
You don't need to find someone to kiss me.

383
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
I won't run away.

384
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Now I have no more body.

385
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
And no more will I live.

386
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
This is the last day.

388
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I'm sick and tired.

389
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I don't know if anyone needs me now.

390
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
What do you mean?

391
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Go.

392
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
You don't report to the police?

393
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
It turns out that the fire was not an accident.

394
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
But my mother did it.

395
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Your mother told me to keep it from you.

396
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,960
But I know that one day you will realize it.

397
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Taobao Shenzhou

399
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Father.

400
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
I want to discuss something with you.

401
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,960
I want to find the deceased's family.

402
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,960
If I need help, I will help.

403
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I will list the deceased's name.

404
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
And I will help them.

405
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Let me do it.

406
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
You didn't know it.

407
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I will do it.

409
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,960
You didn't need to apologize to me.

410
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
You didn't need to apologize to me.

411
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I'm a member of the He family.

412
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,960
I have the responsibility to make up for the victims.

413
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,960
I think you will want me to do it.

414
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Mudan.

415
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
I know you're smart.

416
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,960
But as a woman, you shouldn't worry about this.

417
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
There are many hardships in the world.

418
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Women are hard to bear.

419
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,960
You went to Chang'an and suffered a lot.

420
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Fortunately, you married a good husband.

421
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,960
Although Jiang Chengyang is not a good man, he is a noble man.

422
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,960
He can guarantee that you won't suffer and be bullied.

423
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
You need to look ahead.

424
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You need to take care of your family.

425
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
You need to serve your husband and have children.

426
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Only then you can have a long life.

427
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Father.

428
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
I'm talking about the game.

429
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,960
But you told me that I should have a good life.

430
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
You're a woman.

431
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
This is your home.

432
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Father.

433
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Do you know why I ran away from home and returned home late at night?

434
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Why didn't I go to my home and ran straight to Chang'an?

435
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Because I was in the far place when the Liu family came to arrest me.

436
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
I heard your conversation.

437
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,960
You said that the only place for women is the wedding.

438
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,960
If you find me, you will send me back to the Liu family.

439
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,960
In your heart, I married the Liu family is a great honor.

440
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
I left my husband and humiliated myself.

441
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,960
I didn't know that the Liu family was going to kill you.

442
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I...

443
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Mudan.

444
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Now you are different from before.

445
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
What's the difference?

446
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
You are now the concubine of Jiang Chen'an.

447
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
I was wrong about you.

448
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Now I heard that the general admires you.

449
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Jiangfu has no wife.

450
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,960
You should work hard.

451
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't repeat the Liu family's mistakes.

452
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Father.

453
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Do you know that you love me and protect me, but you despise me?

454
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Do you know that I ran away from home and didn't care about my family?

455
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,960
I tried to survive in order to live a life of a concubine.

456
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Mudan, you are too simple.

457
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,960
You don't know how difficult it is to support the family.

458
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Besides, you are a woman.

459
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,960
You are talking like this because Jiang Chen'an is supporting you.

460
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Do you really think so?

461
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,960
In your eyes, a woman can only rely on a man.

462
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,960
At least he can make you feel better.

463
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Am I right?

464
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:48,960
In your eyes, maybe you are just a woman who only knows how to make a living.

465
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,960
But in my heart, you are the most courageous and the most powerful woman.

466
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,960
In fact, when you are in the most difficult time, you also care about the refugees.

467
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
You use the medicine of the single-person family.

468
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:31,040
When you are in the most difficult time, you burn your favorite flower and

469
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,040
you have to put down your dignity and make a deal with the powerful.

470
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,040
I can understand you better.

471
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:49,040
In order to pass on the message of the family, you can only choose to put your daughter behind the horse.

472
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:58,040
But until today, you have never really understood what kind of woman your mother and I are.

473
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,120
I can't understand what you think.

474
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,120
So you want me to do it, but I can't do it.

475
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Mudan, why are you so stubborn?

476
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,120
I did it for your own good.

477
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I have decided how to use the woman's body to make a living.

478
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
I don't need to talk about it anymore.

479
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
It's getting late.

480
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I'd better go back first, in case my auntie is not happy.

481
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Didn't you say you'd stay a few more days?

482
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,200
No, I have a lot of things to do.

483
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Father, you are old.

484
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
You don't have to worry about the pharmacy.

485
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I asked Zhoran to bring the money and come here.

486
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
It will be changed in two days.

487
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,280
These money should be enough to live in He's and rise again.

488
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:13,280
From now on, you can live in Luoyang with your mother and daughter.

489
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,280
I will remember your kindness.

490
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I will take care of my own affairs.

491
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Please rest assured.

492
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,280
I will take care of my own affairs.

493
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Mudan!

494
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Why don't you go back after dinner?

495
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,280
I want to eat pancakes tonight.

496
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Okay, I'll make it for you.

497
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:45,280
No, father, take care.

498
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,280
I will go back.

499
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I'll go.

500
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Your Majesty, the young mistress is back.

501
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
So soon?

502
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I thought she would stay in Luoyang for a few more days.

503
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Father said that the young mistress sent the guest away.

504
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
She closed the door in advance.

505
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,360
She was in a state of shock.

506
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
She knew it.

507
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I hope that my mother can get a bunch of clouds.

508
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,440
But no one cares about them.

509
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,440
The villagers are dying one by one.

510
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
The construction site of the mountain is buried.

511
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Too many people died.

512
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Too many.

513
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Wu Bo said that Mudan was killed.

514
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,440
The skin in his hands is different from poison.

515
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,520
It's not the devil who killed us.

516
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
It's our enemy.

517
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520
What happened?

518
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,520
What happened?

519
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Tell me.

520
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Tell me if you are nuclear.

521
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Vud vars.

522
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
He never saw you.

523
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,520
He didn't know you were the daughter of He Dianzhu.

524
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
He had a fight with you.

525
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
It was all because of his admiration for you.

526
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
But he did harm your mother.

527
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
It's right for you to hate him.

528
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Does it still hurt?

529
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,520
I know.

530
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
You stopped me from killing Wu Bo.

531
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
It was all because of me.

532
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,520
You're afraid that I'll find out the truth about the 4 years ago.

533
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,520
You're even more afraid that I'll find out about the water crisis.

534
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I regretted it before the marriage.

535
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm sorry.

536
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,520
There's no need to say these three words between us.

537
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
But those words...

538
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,520
...are not heard by those who died 4 years ago.

539
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
As a drug dealer,

540
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
...if you don't give up power,

541
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
...you can't protect me and my mother.

542
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
As a beneficiary,

543
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
...I have nothing to say to him.

544
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,520
But what did those people who died because of the disease do wrong?

545
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,520
I wanted to find out the truth and avenge my mother.

546
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
But in the end, I found that...

547
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
...no one can hate me.

548
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
No one can avenge me.

549
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I always thought that I could do this...

550
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
...to bring good and good fortune to others.

551
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
But there are so many people...

552
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
...who are not only being rewarded,

553
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
...but also being forced to live.

554
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
The world is full of people.

555
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
The world is full of people.

556
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I suddenly don't know...

557
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
...how to be a good dealer.

558
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
I don't know how to be a good dealer.

559
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Even if I can be a good dealer,

560
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
...what's the point of all this?

561
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Wu Dan.

562
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
Ever since you were a dealer,

563
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
...you've never earned any money.

564
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
You've never done anything wrong.

565
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
You've reopened the circle...

566
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
...and made those women who are not worthy of being loved...

567
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
...to have a place in the world.

568
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Why would you do this?

569
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,520
I've trapped myself in this square.

570
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
I can't see the true face of the world.

571
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
How can I know what's the truth?

572
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I don't understand.

573
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
I don't understand.

574
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
I don't understand.

575
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
It's all gone, right?

576
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
The accounts for this month are cleared.

577
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
All the money has been cleared.

578
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
The last one is for you.

579
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Da Fu, Xiao Chun, come with me.

580
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
I've summarized the good deeds of everyone...

581
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
...and the work experience.

582
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Madam Tang, after I leave,

583
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
...I'll arrange everything properly.

584
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
I'll make sure everyone has a suitable position...

585
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
...in the branch.

586
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
If you want to stay in the square,

587
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
...you can do it.

588
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Sister, you are...

589
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
After this last order,

590
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
...the square will be closed for now.

591
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,520
The contract for the flower-pattern house and the bookshop...

592
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
...are all in there.

593
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
Madam Sun, I'll leave it to you.

594
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,520
I'm also relieved that you'll manage the shop.

595
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,520
The square and the flower-pattern house are all in the capital.

596
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
You've given your best effort and achievements.

597
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Yes, Mudan, have you really thought it through?

598
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
After this incident, I've reflected on many things.

599
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
My previous obsession with the Red House...

600
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
...was not a good idea.

601
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I need to clear my mind...

602
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
...and understand the real meaning of this business.

603
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Where is the flower?

604
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,520
Mister, the guard has arrived.

605
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
He has something important to do.

606
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Let's go!

607
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
The flower has bloomed.

608
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
The flower has bloomed.

609
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
The flower has bloomed.

610
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
The flower has bloomed.

611
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
The flower has bloomed.

612
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
The flower has bloomed.

613
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
The flower has bloomed.

614
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
The flower has bloomed.

615
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
The flower has bloomed.

616
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
The flower has bloomed.

617
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
The flower has bloomed.

618
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
The flower has bloomed.

619
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
The flower has bloomed.

620
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
The flower has bloomed.

621
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
The flower has bloomed.

622
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
The flower has bloomed.

623
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
The flower has bloomed.

624
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
The flower has bloomed.

625
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,520
The flower has bloomed.

626
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
The flower has bloomed.

627
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
The flower has bloomed.

628
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
The flower has bloomed.

629
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
The flower has bloomed.

630
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,520
The flower has bloomed.

631
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
The flower has bloomed.

632
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
To be continued...
