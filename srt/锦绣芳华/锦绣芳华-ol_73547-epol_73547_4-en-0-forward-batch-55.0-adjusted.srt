2
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,984

3
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:35,000

4
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,599
Mu Dan has handed over the servant to the authorities.

5
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,800
Lian Zhou is your adopted daughter. I can't make the decision on my own.

6
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
Thinking it over, it's best to return her to you.

7
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,979
Lian Zhou was eager to win your favor, so she acted rashly.

8
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,419
You wouldn't blame me for not guiding her properly, right?

9
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,959
Certainly not, Your Highness, please don't worry.

10
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,860
Had it not been made public, and Lian Zhou couldn't remain in the residence,

11
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,539
I wouldn't have come to disturb you.

12
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:18,379
How is it a disturbance? You should visit more often.

13
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,180
The matter with Lian Zhou was indeed because I chose the wrong person.

14
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,660
Next time,

15
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,590
I'll select a beautiful concubine for you to bring joy to your household.

16
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:44,700
My health really isn't as good as it used to be.

17
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,968
Had my health not led me to neglect Lian Zhou, she wouldn't have done this.

18
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,860
I can only gratefully acknowledge your kindness.

19
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,740
Very well, as you wish.

20
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:11,700
By the way, the position of Minister of Revenue has been vacant for some time.

21
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,580
Many officials have their own recommendations, causing His Majesty much headache.

22
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,119
Has it been any better lately?

23
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:24,619
Each day this important vacancy remains, His Majesty's headache continues.

24
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,600
How could it be better?

25
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:39,020
What do you think of Ruzhou's prefect, Zheng Shou De?

26
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,580
During Zheng's tenure, the taxes collected have been substantial.

27
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,119
Many officials in the capital highly praise him.

28
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,959
This shows he understands his superiors and empathizes with his subordinates.

29
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:00,379
Yes, but unfortunately, Chang'an is far and the steps of Hanyuan Hall are high.

30
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:06,539
Shou De has a strong desire to serve but struggles to gain His Majesty's favor.

31
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,460
With so many unique stones in Ruzhou, His Majesty's attention won't be a problem.

32
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,520
But to prevent the pearls from going unnoticed,

33
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,170
the treasures must be carefully selected

34
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,120
to align with His Majesty's preferences.

35
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,900
The items Shou De offers will be delivered to your residence later.

36
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,979
At that time, I'll trouble you to carefully select a few for him.

37
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:45,439
I'm more than willing to relieve Your Highness and His Majesty's worries.

38
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,520
The Jiang Residence is finally serene, thank you.

39
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,739
I've removed two eyesores for you.

40
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,500
Thanks is all I get? That's rather light.

41
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,300
How about adding ten more jars of fine wine to it?

42
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,580
Do you know what outsiders say about me?

43
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,120
They say I was jealous of Lian Zhou and outmaneuvered her.

44
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,620
But what they dare not say to my face

45
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,060
is that I'm jealous, sly, and narrow-minded.

46
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,439
I've borne such a bad reputation for you, and all I get is ten jars of wine?

47
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,099
Lian Zhou’s been in the residence for a while, so it’s reasonable to send her away.

48
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,380
You investigated, set the trap, and reported it to the authorities.

49
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,260
All these were done while I wasn't in Chang'an.

50
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,700
You stepped forward, removed Zhao Cai, and had the authorities punish him.

51
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,099
Thus, Prince Ning wouldn't be suspicious.

52
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:56,339
This time, your meticulous planning truly relieved my worries.

53
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,099
I was joking. Why are you taking it seriously?

54
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:05,419
Given our relationship, I naturally have to be sincere and loyal.

55
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,200
Just add ten jars of osmanthus wine for me.

56
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,799
Okay.

57
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,739
For Lian Zhou to cause trouble like this, Prince Ning must have exerted pressure.

58
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:34,279
Fortunately, you noticed in time. If you were poisoned because of me, it would be—

59
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,360
All right, I'm so smart, there's no "if."

60
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,600
Stop worrying.

61
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:45,260
All right, all right. Shopkeeper, you're as cunning as a fox.

62
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,099
You can avoid any trap.

63
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,460
I heard Liu Chang used his position in the Ministry of Revenue

64
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,952
to obstruct the dealings of your private shops.

65
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:03,979
Is he targeting you because…

66
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,140
Chuan Yu, this blabbermouth, really tells Da Fu everything.

67
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,260
His actions can't be considered targeting. They're just annoying.

68
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,160
No need to take it to heart.

69
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,539
How about we agree on a secret code?

70
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,879
If you encounter another incident or discover any unusual moves by Prince Ning,

71
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,820
and you can't find me at the moment, leave a message with the code,

72
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,140
and my people will see it.

73
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,879
You're best at being sneaky. I'll follow your lead.

74
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,979
He usually accompanies the imperial chariot, overseeing banquets.

75
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,659
How did he suddenly get the lucrative job of purchasing for Xingqing Palace?

76
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,460
Young Madam, do you know Hexi's Military Governor, General Xiao?

77
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:04,340
I only know General Xiao is quite close to Prince Ning and is well-connected.

78
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,859
The eldest daughter of the Xiao family came to Chang'an a few days ago.

79
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:12,140
Miss Xiao won the Princess's favor and was allowed to stay in this villa.

80
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,380
Miss Xiao grew up with Young Master. She says he knows her habits best.

81
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,400
So the Princess entrusted this task to him.

82
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:25,380
The Princess likes Miss Xiao, but didn't keep her close.

83
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,260
Instead, she arranged for her to live here.

84
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,779
Does she want to match Jiang Chang Yang with her?

85
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,079
No, no, Miss Xiao was invited to the capital by Prince Ning.

86
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,640
Prince Ning values the Xiao family and wants to find her a match

87
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,980
to strengthen his relationship with General Xiao.

88
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,440
The candidate has been decided. It's Pei Zhong, Shangfu's Local Military Captain.

89
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,479
He just arranged his daughter's marriage. Now he's arranging for others.

90
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,620
The marriage of noble families has never been free,

91
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,599
unlike our Young Master.

92
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,500
Thunder? What are you doing here?

93
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,159
Consort Shu.

94
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,980
My lady.

95
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,380
So, you're Mu Dan.

96
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,579
Could you be Miss Xiao?

97
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,819
You've met before.

98
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,220
Miss Xiao saved me once. I owe her my life.

99
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,539
What a coincidence. It seems Sui Zhi owes you a favor as well.

100
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:00,140
Miss Xiao saved me, so naturally, I owe her a favor.

101
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,680
Saving lives is my way to accumulate virtue. You owe me nothing.

102
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,380
I previously said I would present you with a touch of color.

103
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,900
Now, after much turning and twisting, I'm preparing this floral banquet for you.

104
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,700
We arrived at the same destination anyway.

105
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,679
Miss, if you came to Chang'an last year, why have you never shown yourself?

106
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,900
Last year, I came because my grandmother was ill. I brought her to see Physician Fu.

107
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,299
Xue Xi is close with her grandmother and takes care of her every day.

108
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,699
She naturally had no interest in socializing.

109
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,980
Has your grandmother recovered?

110
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,740
All our relatives were concerned about her. Once she recovered, we set off for home.

111
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,260
Our trip was so rushed that we couldn't attend your wedding banquet.

112
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,439
At my place... we never lack good wine.

113
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,520
Whenever you want to eat or drink, come to Fragrance Garden anytime.

114
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,840
- I'll accompany you to enjoy flowers and taste wine.
 - All right,

115
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,640
since you're with Sui Zhi, there's no need for formalities between us.

116
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,299
In the future, just call me Xue Xi.

117
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,319
All right, Xue Xi.

118
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,520
The nobles endlessly praised your flowers.

119
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,539
Consort Shu was also very happy, so she ordered me to escort you out of the palace.

120
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,819
Thank you.

121
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,419
Please.

122
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,579
- Xue Xi is truly beautiful.
 - Yes, she is.

123
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,419
- Not as beautiful as these flowers.
 - This is so nice.

124
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,020
She's still an unmarried young lady.

125
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,839
Seeing Xue Xi makes me a bit happier.

126
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
Go have some fun.

127
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,860
Thank you for saving me.

128
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,280
- It's good that you weren't hurt.
 - Miss.

129
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,040
County Princess.

130
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:28,959
It's Xue Xi's first banquet in Chang'an. How come you're late, Captain Pei?

131
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:33,539
So, you're Miss Xiao. I apologize for my rudeness.

132
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,620
On the way here, my carriage accidentally bumped into a playful child.

133
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,020
I took him to a clinic and only dared to leave after ensuring he was fine.

134
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,879
Forgive me for being rude, Miss Xiao.

135
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,419
A banquet is nowhere as important as a child's life.

136
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,900
You did nothing wrong, there's no need to apologize.

137
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,220
I don't think he's late. Captain Pei arrived just in time.

138
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,199
Otherwise, who would catch Xue Xi?

139
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,740
The Princess intends to match Jiang Chang Yang and Xiao Xue Xi.

140
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,479
They are childhood sweethearts and share a deep bond.

141
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Even if you have Father's recommendation, you can't be careless.

142
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,839
Seeing each other day and night may not compare to a bond at first sight.

143
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,599
I believe in a destined marriage, and I ask Prince Ning to trust me.

144
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:45,779
Reeds on the shore mark summer’s end, and riverside trees bring the first coolness.

145
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:52,059
Water seems connected with the chamber, and the boat floats as if in a fairy pond.

146
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:58,140
The heavenly pond is so vast, and I'm idly alone at dusk.

147
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:05,520
Since you have this leisure and elegance, why not row yourself?

148
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,459
Da Fu said you're in the shop all day, either doing the accounts or planting flowers.

149
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,500
It's made your shoulder blades sore, I'm doing this for your good.

150
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,880
Why exactly did you bring me here without Da Fu or Chuan Yu?

151
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Do I need a reason to go on an outing with you?

152
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Not for Jiang Chang Yang, but the Floral Envoy has never had good intentions.

153
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,939
Isn't that Xue Xi?

154
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:52,860
I see, so you came for Xue Xi today.

155
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,539
No wonder Captain Pei rescued the damsel when he first met Xue Xi.

156
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,580
All of Chang'an has heard this romantic story. Couldn't sit still anymore?

157
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,179
Shouldn't it be the Floral Envoy went boating with his beloved and ran into these two?

158
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:11,839
You're so reluctant to admit it.

159
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,620
If you care, you care. There are no outsiders here anyway.

160
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,299
In our childhood, we were neighbors in Jiangnan for several years.

161
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:24,819
My mother liked girls, so she cared for Xue Xi like a daughter.

162
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,200
As for me, I just see her as a sister.

163
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,380
All right, fine, you have an open and honest sibling relationship.

164
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,260
Then, there's no problem at all. I'll take you to the winery now.

165
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,140
Pei Zhong is someone Prince Ning chose.

166
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,539
If I disturb them proactively, wouldn't others think I'm disrespecting Prince Ning?

167
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,260
You've been misunderstood a lot, Floral Envoy.

168
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,199
This is about marriage. Show the courage you should have, let's go.

169
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,860
I told you there's no romantic entanglement. Must I jump into the river to prove that?

170
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,620
That's not necessary. Why do you need to prove it to me?

171
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:38,160
But that is strange. With the afterglow covering the river, the scenery is perfect.

172
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,860
Why are they covering the beautiful scenery?

173
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,480
Unless they aren't here to enjoy the scenery.

174
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,379
What are you doing?

175
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,079
If the winery people save us now, it wouldn’t count as taking the initiative.

176
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,119
Thanks to your timely rescue, my beloved and I didn’t fall into the water and catch a cold.

177
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:24,400
Here, bring out your best wine.

178
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,240
Thank you for the reward, Young Master. Coming right up.

179
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,720
Wait a moment.

180
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:35,000
Honey. Didn't you say a Miss Qiu here played the pipa exquisitely?

181
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,699
With such beautiful scenery, why not call her to liven things up for us?

182
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,170
All right.

183
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:44,280
Miss Qiu is currently playing for other guests.

184
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,380
Who dares compete with me for her? Go tell him that I'll cover his tab today.

185
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,460
It's the Local Military's Captain Pei.

186
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,730
He asked us not to disturb before the moon rises.

187
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,860
Oh, Brother Pei. That's fine.

188
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,280
I'll personally go find him. He'll surely let Miss Qiu play for me.

189
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,980
Lead the way.

190
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:16,480
I'll pour another glass for you, Miss Xiao.

191
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm feeling somewhat unwell. Captain Pei, please call my maid in.

192
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,060
I'll take my leave first.

193
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,000
The clear sound hasn't ended, and the scenery is yet to be appreciated.

194
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,860
Xue Xi, why not stay a bit longer?

195
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,920
You drugged me.

196
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,040
Someone! A'Hui. A'Hui...

197
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,879
If others see us like this, even if it's nothing, you'll have to marry me.

198
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:03,380
Our fates are destined by heaven, and we have Prince Ning as a guarantor.

199
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,780
Why cause a disgrace and bring shame to the Xiao family?

200
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,680
What do you say?

201
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,719
Brother Pei.

202
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,280
This tune was in its melodious part. Why did it stop?

203
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,580
Brother Sui Zhi, what are you doing here?

204
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,200
I was boating with my beloved and almost fell into the water.

205
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,040
The winery's lad rescued us, so I thought of coming for a drink.

206
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,600
I wanted to borrow Miss Qiu from your room to play me a tune.

207
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,699
Have I disturbed you?

208
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,000
But you said there were only clean courtesans here. You’ve lied to me again.

209
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,930
Brother Pei probably brought a beauty.

210
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,400
I want to see which family's lady she is.

211
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,399
Brother Sui Zhi.

212
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:28,580
Honey, don't come in!

213
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,350
Xue Xi.

214
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,800
Brother Pei, you're quite bold. She's a Xiao.

215
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,920
You were already getting to know each other. Why use such methods?

216
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:51,159
We both know to whom the Princess wants to betroth her to.

217
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,520
It's a fair competition.

218
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,399
I'm as close as family with Prince Ning and have a beloved concubine.

219
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:02,079
Why would I ruin your marriage?

220
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,839
If that's the case, take your person and leave.

221
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,720
The person Prince Ning has taken a liking to is indeed extraordinary.

222
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,020
Even after being interrupted, you can still continue calmly with your tasks.

223
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,319
Those who achieve great things don't fuss over minor details.

224
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,280
Considering Xiao Xue Xi's disposition,

225
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,919
if she wakes up and finds her chastity lost to you, she won't marry you.

226
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,200
If you plan to make a scene to force her and to shame the Xiao family,

227
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,000
she'll either cut her hair to become a nun or prove her resolution by death.

228
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,590
If the Xiao family were to lose their beloved daughter,

229
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,119
at that time, who would Prince Ning abandon,

230
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,459
to appease the anger of the Xiao family?

231
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,079
Floral Envoy.

232
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,560
Judging by the color, the drug should have dissipated.

233
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:23,400
If you hadn't come here unexpectedly today,

234
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,170
my life would probably have been ruined.

235
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:31,740
Xue Xi, it's all in the past now.

236
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,019
How can you consider ruining your entire life just because a beast groped you?

237
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,780
Remember, nothing is more important than your life.

238
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,970
But it's not just about me.

239
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,819
Pei Zhong wants to use me to control the entire Xiao family.

240
00:23:55,819 --> 00:24:00,919
If my family gets entangled with such a scoundrel, the consequences could be endless.

241
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,660
- Thank you on behalf of my family.
 - Xue Xi.

242
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,779
If your mother were alive to see you so distant,

243
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,400
she would slap your hand.

244
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,520
Since Pei Zhong didn't succeed, he won't spread this matter.

245
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,720
This hurdle should be over.

246
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,720
I learned the swing breaking was also Pei Zhong’s doing.

247
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,900
This person is deeply scheming. Be very cautious of him in the future.

248
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:47,279
Xue Xi, why not tell the Princess and have her stand up for you?

249
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:55,879
If I don't agree to this marriage, the Xiao family will certainly refuse Prince Ning.

250
00:24:55,879 --> 00:25:01,240
If Pei Zhong is punished again because of me, it'll offend Prince Ning.

251
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,090
As a daughter of the Xiao family,...

252
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,350
I have to consider the family's interests.

253
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,979

254
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:20,680
Pei Zhong is adept at disguise, how did you find out?

255
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,359

256
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,399
Pei Zhong seems calm and gentle, completely without a warrior’s fierceness.

257
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,760
But in private, he enjoys abusing women most.

258
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,319
In his residence, the concubines are changed every month.

259
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,800
The number of women who have been toyed with and died at his hands is countless.

260
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,720
Pei Zhong is such a beast, truly unworthy of being called human.

261
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,019
I didn't want to intervene in this matter for fear of arousing Prince Ning's suspicion,

262
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:11,499
but I also cannot watch Xue Xi lose her life in vain.

263
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,839
I understand. You couldn't directly advise Xue Xi,

264
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,040
because Pei Zhong appears flawless in front of others.

265
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,820
And as the Floral Envoy, you shouldn't know the court officials' secrets.

266
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,359
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

267
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,760
If you need my help in the future, I'll cooperate with you.

268
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,419
As long as you, Floral Envoy, provide the future midnight snacks…

269
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,520
There'll be plenty of midnight snacks.

270
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,070
Let's go.

271
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,679
Jiang Chang Yang.

272
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,340
Every time I feel I know you well enough,

273
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,000
I discover more secrets hidden in your heart.

274
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,460
Is it tiring?

275
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,459
I'm with someone who sees secrets, but doesn't question them,

276
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
so how could it be tiring?

277
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,570
The old ministers are petitioning His Majesty

278
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:22,050
to make Consort Shu's son the Crown Prince.

279
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,079
Prince Lang is gifted and greatly favored by His Majesty.

280
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:34,780
Consort Shu is a general's daughter and holds high esteem among the old ministers.

281
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,419
He's indeed the perfect choice to suppress Prince Ning.

282
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:45,259
Do you have a strategy to deal with it?

283
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,839
Establishing a crown prince is only a matter of time.

284
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,480
If His Majesty likes Prince Lang, so be it.

285
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,659
Who the crown prince is isn't important. What matters is who raises him.

286
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:13,040
As long as Prince Lang becomes the son of Consort Hui,

287
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,560
then the crown prince will be yours.

288
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,559
Why worry about changes?

289
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,520
Indeed, there has been progress.

290
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,659
Good, I leave this matter to you.

291
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,199
Yes.

292
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,419
Reward them.

293
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,340
Yes.

294
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,820
- Reward them.
 - Thank you, Consort Shu.

295
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,439
Sit down.

296
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,480
This pastry seems different from the usual single-layered ones we eat. Any reason?

297
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,839
Consort Shu, the Princess was concerned that Xue Xi might not like Chang'an cuisine,

298
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:20,399
so she specifically instructed me to make some hometown flavors she loves.

299
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,919
This pastry may not be considered high-class, but it's from the shop Xue Xi loved most.

300
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,760
It's blended with nine secret spices, offering a unique taste.

301
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,640
Indeed, it's the taste of childhood.

302
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,140
Consort Shu, quick, have a try.

303
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,020
Wait.

304
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,359
Consort Shu. This pastry has cassia added, which clashes with today's medicinal dishes.

305
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,440
It's better to eat it another day.

306
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,659
Mu Dan, thank you.

307
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,420
Thunder. Thunder.

308
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,839
- Thunder!
 - The food is poisoned. Protect the Consort!

309
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,600
 - Yes!
 - Thunder!

310
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Thunder!

311
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,919
This banquet was hosted by Vice Minister Jiang, and the pastry also presented by him.

312
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,380
Capture Jiang Chang Yang now!

313
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,720
Consort Shu, only your plate of Golden Milk Crisp was poisoned. The rest are fine.

314
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,119
Envoy Jiang has always been reliable in handling matters for His Majesty.

315
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:07,639
How did such a mishap happen today?

316
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,639
If it's an oversight due to being busy, that's one thing.

317
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:16,800
Consort Shu, you must investigate it and be wary of those with other intentions.

318
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,520
He handles all purchases for Xingqing Palace, so occasional oversights are understandable.

319
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,280
Many have handled the Golden Milk Crisp, and anyone could have tampered with it.

320
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,459
I trust that Sui Zhi was unaware.

321
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:36,599
You're right.

322
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:44,200
Interrogate these servants thoroughly. Under punishment, someone will tell the truth.

323
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,240
Consort Shu, before serving,

324
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,879
I saw Envoy Jiang giving instructions to Shou Zhong outside the kitchen.

325
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:54,620
But the distance was too far, so I didn't hear clearly what was said.

326
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,440
What did Envoy Jiang say to you?

327
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,680
He only instructed me to watch the steamer so as not to miss the timing.

328
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,839
At His Majesty's banquet, Envoy Jiang never went to the kitchen.

329
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,860
Why was he so attentive today?

330
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:22,300
Sui Zhi is close to Xue Xi and entrusted by the Princess to oversee the food.

331
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,019
It's understandable for him to be attentive to the Golden Milk Crisp.

332
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:35,000
Consort Shu, these gold ingots were all hidden in the Shou Zhong's pillow.

333
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,280
I didn't know an inner attendant's monthly salary was so high!

334
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,359
Take this inner attendant away. He can't die before the truth is uncovered.

335
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,059
 Yes.

336
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,520
Envoy, please save me! You can't just watch me die!

337
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm begging you, please save me. Please save me.

338
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,440
 I thought you wanted to win over Jiang Chang Yang before.

339
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,440
 Why frame him for poisoning this time?

340
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,580
 I also want to know

341
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,300
 if Zi Shu has other ulterior motives with this arrangement.

342
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,879
 Suspicious people have appeared near the newly built merchant ship.

343
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,520
 This person is elusive, and we haven't been able to discern their identity.

344
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
 According to those following him,

345
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,480
 the only place he has entered and exited twice is Jiang Chang Yang's Wanguan Hall.

346
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,399
 Wanguan Hall does business without question, so it's not surprising he went there.

347
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:42,000
 For Your Highness's great endeavor, there can't be any oversight.

348
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,540
 When Jiang Chang Yang is in trouble, if this person acts,

349
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,799
 Your Highness can achieve two goals at once. If he isn’t related to Jiang Chang Yang,

350
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:55,160
 you can also step in to save him and grant him a favor.

351
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,420
 Zi Shu.

352
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:01,780
 Proceed as Zi Shu suggested.

353
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,030
 Don't act willfully.

354
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,359
You can't just watch me die! I'm begging you, save me. Please save me.

355
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,039
This little inner attendant is so scared. Does Envoy Jiang have nothing to say?

356
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,039
I don't even know him. What is there to say?

357
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,399
My husband can enter and exit the palace daily. If he wanted to,

358
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:33,330
he could have done it discreetly or have his subordinates bribe an attendant.

359
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,919
Why commit murder in public?

360
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:39,660
And why would personally collude with an attendant?

361
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:47,120
Consort Shu, you're wise and can certainly see through such a clumsy frame-up.

362
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,960
How can a lowly concubine of a merchant family speak in front of nobility?

363
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,300
People of the Jiang Residence aren't for outsiders to comment on.

364
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:57,900
If my husband really wanted to poison Consort Shu,

365
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,240
as his concubine, why would I reveal the medicine's incompatibility?

366
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,660
And why would I stop Consort Shu from eating this pastry?

367
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,104
Mu Dan is right. Sui Zhi is closest to His Majesty.

368
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:14,439
His Majesty cherishes Consort Shu and loves Prince Lang even more.

369
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,600
Sui Zhi has no reason to poison Consort Shu.

370
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,300
You like gold ingots, right?

371
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,160
As long as you truthfully confess who set this trap,

372
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,039
I can plead for you, spare your life,

373
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,800
and give you double the gold ingots.

374
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,760
I don't know.

375
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,640
I believe in Sui Zhi. Let's leave this matter for Sui Zhi to investigate thoroughly.

376
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,959
His name hasn't yet been cleared. To be fair, the Ministry of Justice should handle it.

377
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,640
That makes sense.

378
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,200
Sui Zhi, you return home first.

379
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,180
If the Ministry of Justice has any inquiries, cooperate well.

380
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:08,240
Consort Shu, how can a suspect be released before the case is thoroughly investigated?

381
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,059
Where is the majesty of the royal family?

382
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,399
Yesterday, when His Majesty inquired about Prince Lang's studies,

383
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:22,839
he said the law doesn't favor the noble, a rope doesn't bend for the crooked.

384
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:27,200
Consort Shu, as the head of the palace, you should set an example for your child.

385
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,940
Do not let His Majesty be disappointed.

386
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,479
I don't mind laying at the Ministry of Justice for a couple of days.

387
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:48,919
I believe Consort Shu and His Majesty can definitely clear my name.

388
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:19,439
What are you standing there for? Hurry and fetch a bucket of clean water.

389
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:21,019
This cell is too dirty.

390
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,579
I need to tidy up well so that Young Master can settle in comfort.

391
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,760
Yes.

392
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:41,499
She Yan was investigating Liu Chang's smuggling and was being followed outside Wanguan.

393
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,740
Prince Ning's sudden attack is probably because he suspects me.

394
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,819
Should we inform She Yan to remain silent for a while?

395
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,560
This doesn't match the place. Change it.

396
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,119
Yes, Sir.

397
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,599
This bed…

398
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,760
Young Master, the bed is on its way.

399
00:39:03,979 --> 00:39:07,960
If She Yan completely conceals himself, Liu Chang won't find any clues

400
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,280
and will instead suspect that he's involved with my troubles.

401
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:16,459
Why don't we use this plan against them?

402
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,240
Could you see if you can let me in for a moment?

403
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,099
No one is allowed to visit.

404
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,700
I know, I know.

405
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,359
I'll go in for one incense stick's time, even half of one works.

406
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,220
I'll say a few words to my husband, and then I'll leave.

407
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,319
Take this.

408
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,900
No, and that's final! This isn't a place for a merchant to make a fuss!

409
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,560
Are you leaving or not? If not, there'll be no courtesy.

410
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,470

411
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,980
Mu Dan.

412
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,740
Xue Xi.

413
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,399
Mu Dan, you're truly refined to think of gifting this.

414
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:19,319
The cell is lonely and desolate, so I thought of adding a touch of life.

415
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,280
I also brought some clothes and food.

416
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,039
How is the case progressing?

417
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,519
The inner supervisor has been severely punished but still insists Sui Zhi did it.

418
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,879
Are there no other witnesses?

419
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:38,720
His Majesty and Consort Shu believe in Sui Zhi. The truth will come out.

420
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,919
You don't need to be overly worried.

421
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,610
It's rare for him to live in such a place.

422
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,879
I wonder what disdainful expression he'll wear.

423
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,779
Let's go in and have a look.

424
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:55,300
They just said no one is allowed to enter.

425
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,879
I'll take you in.

426
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:04,959
- The Princess ordered my lady to bring some food to the Floral Envoy.
 - Yes.

427
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,280
- Lead the way.
 - Miss, please.

428
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
Let's go.

429
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:39,879
Do you know who framed you? I can help investigate outside the palace.

430
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:43,740
You inadvertently stopped Consort Shu and messed up their scheme.

431
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,319
The person who poisoned the food must hate you for meddling.

432
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,059
So, you can't get involved in it any further.

433
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,479
But you're here. How can I possibly stay out of it?

434
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,999
I can't intervene with the nobility,

435
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,720
but I can handle things outside the palace. I can help you find the peddler.

436
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,360
The opponent is fully prepared to frame me. How could they let you find a flaw?

437
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,579
I have my own way to resolve it.

438
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,899
Before I get out, stay in the Jiang Residence and don't show yourself.

439
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,260
Be wary of Liu Chang and the County Princess.

440
