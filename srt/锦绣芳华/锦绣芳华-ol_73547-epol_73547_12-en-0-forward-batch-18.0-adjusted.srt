00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,980

3
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,970

4
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,180
Young Master.

5
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,180
- Did the fish bite the hook?
 - Yes.

6
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,059
Vice Minister Lu boarded Liu Chang's boat with guards.

7
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,680
Tie it tightly.

8
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,260
Everyone on the boat, listen.

9
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,979
Stand in a line immediately and wait to be inspected!

10
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,260
Prince Ning is suspected of smuggling,

11
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,339
and you gave his son-in-law
the position of Deputy Transport Officer.

12
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,700
They ate the fatty meat sent to their mouths

13
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,980
without knowing that the meat contained bones,
which would get stuck in their throats.

14
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,936
After tonight, Prince Ning's source of wealth
will be completely cut off.

15
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,592
It's not just a source of wealth.

16
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:02,499
Did She Yan not tell you
what goods they were transporting?

17
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,900
Don't you know him?

18
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,400
He's tight-lipped.
He doesn't even talk in his sleep.

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,140
Prince Ning's ambition is boundless.

20
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,980
To grasp military power,
he needs standardized weapons of war.

21
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,659
What do you think he used
to make private weapons before?

22
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,020
Does Liu Chang even dare to transport
copper and iron mines?

23
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,860
With Prince Ning backing him up,
what wouldn't he dare to do?

24
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,140
Mr. Jiang, this fish meat is
too fishy. I can't eat it.

25
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,479
Take it to feed the stray cats.

26
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,539
The Floral Envoy wanted to catch
the first fish of the Spring

27
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,779
and caught a chill accidentally,
so he'll have to take leave tomorrow.

28
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:49,339
I can't see the Emperor's fury in person
or witness Liu Chang be imprisoned.

29
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,439
Mr. Jiang, you have planned this for long.

30
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,020
Now that the tasks are complete,
you should take a break.

31
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,680
And it prevents Prince Ning's rage
from burning innocent people.

32
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,939
Assistant Minister Lu,
what is the purpose of such a grand setup?

33
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,719
Mr. Liu, I have received a report

34
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,020
saying that someone violated the regulations,
smuggling prohibited goods at night.

35
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,819
So I came to verify. I wonder why you are on this boat.

36
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,900
Assistant Minister, you're joking.

37
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,779
I am in charge of canal transport matters.

38
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:32,499
This boat's shipment has already been approved.
How come there's talk of violations?

39
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,580
Mr. Lu, your trip is likely to end in vain.

40
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,539
So it was Mr. Liu's special approval.

41
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:42,060
So it seems the person who reported it
is fabricating rumors and framing others.

42
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,419
That's right.

43
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,020
Well, since I've boarded the ship,

44
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,140
whether there are prohibited goods on board
will be clear upon inspection.

45
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,940
If it turns out to be a false alarm,

46
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,060
I will properly apologize to Mr. Liu.

47
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,539
- Search.
- Yes!

48
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,276
Wait.

49
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,380
Assistant Minister Lu, you should think carefully.

50
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,079
Prince Ning's Mansion is behind me.

51
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,079
Are you offending Prince Ning today
and setting yourself against him?

52
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,419
Mr. Liu, do not make it difficult
for me. It is my duty.

53
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,140
If this boat is indeed clean,

54
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,380
I will go to Prince Ning's Mansion tomorrow
to admit my guilt and ask for punishment.

55
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,720
- Search now.
- Yes!

56
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:50,520
It's past the fourth watch of the night,
why did Lu suddenly board the ship?

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,700
Your Highness, this shipment arranged by Mr. Liu
was extremely secretive.

58
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,020
I truly don't know when it was exposed.

59
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,659
People have already boarded the ship,
yet you say it was extremely secretive.

60
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,940
If they discover the things on the ship,

61
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,460
His Majesty will surely detect
our privately established weaponry workshop.

62
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,140
Rest assured, Your Majesty.
Mr. Liu is thorough and considerate.

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,859
Although our cargo ship was intercepted,

64
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:19,419
our grand plan might not have been exposed.

65
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,199
Liu Chang, how do you explain this?

66
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,639
I acknowledge my guilt, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,060
Is that all you have to say?

68
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,959
Tell me, what is the story
behind these copper and iron statues?

69
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,480
Your Majesty, my father
has always believed in spirits and deities.

70
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,419
In recent years, he has become even more obsessed.

71
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,728
After he was dismissed
from his position, he fell ill,

72
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:29,500
praying to gods and worshiping Buddhas everywhere.

73
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,779
That is why he heeded the master's guidance

74
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,779
and believed that inviting 99 deities
to watch over the house could cure him.

75
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,860
As a filial gesture, I privately cast these statues of deities

76
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,279
and planned to present them
to my father as a birthday gift.

77
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,500
So, should I praise you as a great filial son?

78
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:55,580
Nearly a hundred statues were transported
into the warehouse with much fanfare.

79
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,140
The people along the way saw everything.

80
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,580
Now, rumors are spreading
vigorously in the streets.

81
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,380
Where is my face, my dignity?

82
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,420
As a transport officer, you have abused your power
and broken the law knowingly.

83
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,079
Who would dare to trust officials, or trust me?

84
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,539
Your Majesty, you're absolutely right.

85
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,539
For all I know, since Minister Zheng took office,
he has colluded with Liu Chang,

86
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:20,099
secretly transporting tributes
and selling a large number of foreign items.

87
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,739
Meanwhile, they have accepted bribes
and sheltered unscrupulous merchants.

88
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:26,419
As a result, the common people
have suffered greatly.

89
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,539
Minister Zheng even dares to be
corrupt and accept bribes?

90
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,419
A thorough investigation must be conducted.

91
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,179
Your Majesty, I am being wronged.

92
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,099
Your Majesty, I have known Shou De for many years
and understand his character well.

93
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,020
He could not possibly use his position
for personal benefit or bend the law.

94
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,220
There must be some misunderstanding here.

95
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,140
If Prince Ning vouches for Minister Zheng,
of course, I believe him.

97
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,080
But, how do you think this matter
should be addressed, Ning?

98
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:33,340
Liu Chang wields significant power,

99
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,519
yet he does not appreciate the Emperor's favor
and uses power for personal gain.

100
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,799
He should be severely punished.

101
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,020
Please, Your Majesty, remove him
from his position as the Transport Officer.

102
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,620
Ning, this is your son-in-law.

103
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,620
When it comes to national affairs,
I dare not consider personal feelings.

104
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,860
On the contrary, Liu Chang has betrayed
the trust of both me and the County Princess.

105
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,320
He should be severely punished.

106
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,260
What a display of righteousness
by sacrificing one's kin!

107
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,819
Prince Ning is truly the pillar of the nation.

108
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,820
Liu Chang,

109
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,100
do you have anything else to say?

110
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,400
I humbly admit my guilt.

111
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:38,140
Alright, let's do as Prince Ning says.

112
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,860
Furthermore, to reassure the citizens,

113
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,779
the canal transport
must also be properly rectified.

114
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,579
Assistant Minister Lu
has made a meritorious arrest.

115
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,059
The position of Transport Officer
will be entrusted to you in the future.

116
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,819
Manage it well on my behalf.

117
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,439
Be sure to eradicate smuggling and corruption.

118
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,539
I accept the decree.

119
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,340
Come on.

120
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,060
Do you think it's unfair?

121
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,728
I dare not.

122
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,459
Minister Zheng holds a critical position
and cannot afford any slip-ups.

123
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,740
I can only apologize to you.

124
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,980
I understand.

125
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,620
But you did a good job this time.

126
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,340
Although the bronze and iron statues
were investigated,

127
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,620
many officials are also aware
of your father's devotion to deities.

128
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,699
So, the excuse of fulfilling filial duties
is somewhat acceptable.

129
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,140
If Assistant Minister Lu
truly discovered the raw ores

130
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,539
that would indeed be a big problem.

131
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,100
This matter has become known to everyone.

132
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,600
His Majesty feels embarrassed
and thus demands a thorough investigation.

133
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,059
But it's just for show.

134
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,179
Once he finds new amusements in the future,
he will naturally forget about this.

135
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:13,519
Then, I will have ample opportunity
to let you return to the court.

136
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

137
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,980
Lately, you should act with discretion.

138
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,819
The weaponry workshop is temporarily dissolved.
Everyone should stay low.

139
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,272
Yes.

140
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,630
By the way,

141
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:41,860
since you are dismissed and at home, it is just right to spend more time
with the County Princess.

142
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,699
It's also a good thing.

143
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,640
I understand.

144
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,860
Alright, just stop here.

145
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,939
Lift the items properly.

146
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,579
Mr. He, I purchased many precious medicines
from your shop in the past.

147
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,779
Now the He family has fallen,
I don't want to be extreme.

148
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,200
However, if you still can't settle the account
by the fifth of next month,

149
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,600
these two boxes won't suffice to solve the matter.

150
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,860
Yes, yes.

151
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,759
Thank you, Mr. Ding, for your understanding.

152
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,179
Your eldest daughter is thriving in Chang'an.

153
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:48,939
How come she doesn't
properly honor you as her father?

154
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:52,080
If I hadn't seen the desolation of your home
with my own eyes today,

155
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,539
I would have thought
you were pretending to be poor.

156
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,632
Alright, I'm leaving.

157
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,900
Take care, Mr. Ding.

158
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,399
This Mr. Ding is truly insatiable.

159
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:12,480
Those were two boxes of top-quality
paintings and calligraphy given to him for free.

160
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,140
But he didn't even agree to extend the deadline.

161
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,899
With such a huge deficit, how can we
pay it back by the fifth of next month?

162
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,839
Man Er, what's wrong?

163
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,912
What's wrong, Man Er?

164
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,799
Are you hurt?

165
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,020
Man Er, why did you drop the plate?

166
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,579
The sweet crisps were not tasty.

167
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,220
If it's not tasty, then don't eat it.
I'll make you a new one.

168
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,900
Everything made is not tasty.
I want to eat the snacks from Bifangzhai.

169
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,579
Okay, okay. I'll send someone
to buy it for you later, okay?

170
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,380
Why? Everyone in the house
is tightening their belts now.

171
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,980
Look at you. Do you still think
you're a wealthy child?

172
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,740
Why are you yelling at him?

173
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,439
He's still just a child. He doesn't understand anything.

174
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:01,939
Just a child?

175
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,699
When Mu Dan was his age,

176
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:07,120
she not only knew literature
but could also help me with the accounts.

177
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,080
She never caused me any worry.

178
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,459
What is your intention in saying this now?

179
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,480
No matter how talented He Wei Fang is,
did she ever think of you kindly?

180
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,100
Since she went to Chang'an, except for sending a few letters home,

181
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,539
has she ever thought of visiting us?

182
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,020
She is now the top flower merchant.

183
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,600
The Fragrance Garden uses so much money daily.

184
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,019
Has she thought about coming back to support us?

185
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,620
The Fragrance Garden
was left to her by her mother.

186
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,860
Back then, when we sold the garden for business,

187
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,179
we'd let her down.

188
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,100
Mu Dan must have suffered a lot in Chang'an.

189
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,939
And now, she's become
the top flower merchant on her own.

190
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:01,260
What face do I have to ask her for help?

191
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,740
Face, face.

192
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,939
You father and daughter only know about face.

193
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,819
Can that face be turned into gold ingots or money?

194
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,980
Can't you see what a state
our family has fallen into?

195
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,480
If you ask me, if He Wei Fang
had even a bit of filial piety left,

196
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,759
she should quickly come back with thousands of
bolts of silk and apologize to us.

197
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,419
You, you're unbelievable.

198
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,799
Mom, why is Dad so angry?

199
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,860
It has nothing to do with you.

200
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,459
Your dad is angry at your sister
for being disloyal and unfilial.

201
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,980
What use is being angry?

202
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,860
She is one of the He family members.

203
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,340
Her mistakes should be punished
with a disciplinary cane.

204
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,260
What kind of He family member is she?

205
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,260
You're right.

206
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,279
Man Er, you're right.

207
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,779
As long as this sister of yours
still bears the He surname,

208
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,579
she can never sever ties with us.

209
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,159
Come on, I'll take you
to buy some snacks. Let's go.

210
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,910
Take care, please.

211
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,540

212
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,159
Lady, please.

213
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,419
Where are we?

214
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,359
This is our future gold nugget.

215
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,032
Auntie.

216
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,979
How has father been lately?

217
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,028
He is doing well.

218
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:05,300
Seeing you so prosperous in Chang'an,
I am also very relieved.

219
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,900
Your father often thinks of you in Luoyang.

220
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,799
He asked me to bring these Hu cake for you to eat.

221
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,459
Why didn't he come personally?

222
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,219
Mu Dan, there's something you don't know.

223
00:18:22,219 --> 00:18:26,599
The He family has been losing more each year.

224
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,499
Now there is nothing left in the house.

225
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:34,499
Your father is busy running everywhere
to repay debts.

226
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:37,200
How can he make time to come?

227
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,820
How did it come to this?

228
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,419
Father was one of the top merchants
back in the day.

229
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,979
How did he fall to such a state?

230
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:51,459
As you know,

231
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:57,620
when you married Liu Chang,
the He family spent so much to support you?

232
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,459
Later when you ran away from the Liu family,
everyone thought you were dead.

233
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:07,179
The Liu family not only stopped supporting us,
but also made things difficult everywhere.

234
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,900
How could we fight against officials?

235
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,300
Others are also opportunistic.

236
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,300
So how can we continue with the business?

237
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,499
Mu Dan, your carefree life now

238
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:27,480
has come at the cost of the He family's safety.

239
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,759
I understand.

240
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,740
I'll pack up and make a trip to Luoyang. I'll discuss solutions with Father.

241
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,939
No, no, no.

242
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:42,359
You know how your father's like.

243
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,780
He couldn't bring himself to come,
so he sent me to find you.

244
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,659
Even if you go back, he won't see you.

245
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:55,440
But if I don't go back,
how can I help Father manage the business?

246
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,459
You have a point.

247
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,179
I know both you and your father

248
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,380
keep each other in your hearts.

249
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,259
Your father talks about you every day in Luoyang,

250
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:11,419
saying he feels guilty toward you.

251
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,019
He also said that when you were Man Er's age,

252
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,300
you already knew how to help him count
and manage accounts.

253
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,639
You were very filial.

254
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,580
Now that Father is in trouble,

255
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,359
even if he won't see me,
I won't stand by and do nothing.

256
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,340
How about this? I will have someone
prepare some jade and silk first.

257
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,939
You can take it back to relieve the urgent need.

258
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,659
In the next few days,
I will contact the medicine merchants in Chang'an

259
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,099
and find a way to make connections to get Father's business up and running again.

260
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:54,119
Okay, I'm pleased to see you so filial.

261
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,079
However, these methods you mentioned

262
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:01,680
can't fundamentally solve
the He's family's predicament.

263
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,499
Auntie, what do you mean by this?

264
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,039
I have been with your father all these years.

265
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,659
I have a little knowledge about business matters.

266
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,039
There's no need to hide it from me.

267
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,939
Everyone in Chang'an knows

268
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:23,780
that the Fragrance Garden
is your fundamental source of wealth.

269
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,259
Father didn't send you.

270
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,279
Mu Dan, why do you say so?

271
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,979
Of course, your father sent me.

272
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,860
I know Father.

273
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,219
He loved Mother deeply.

274
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,780
What Mother cherished most
in her life was the Fragrance Garden.

275
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,860
Father knows this very well,

276
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,540
so how could he ask me for it?

277
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,419
Auntie, you went to great lengths coming to Chang'an without telling Father.

278
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,259
But unfortunately,
you won't get a single penny from me,

279
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:58,179
and you won't be able
to take the Fragrance Garden from me.

280
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,839
Someone, see the guests out.

281
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,380
Please.

282
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,119
Mu Dan, you misunderstood me.

283
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,100
Mu Dan, the He family truly needs your help now.

284
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,979
Look at Man Er. Look at your brother.

285
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:13,499
He is still so young.

286
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:19,400
Can you bear to see him suffer hunger and cold,
living rough with us?

287
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,400
An unreasonable and vulgar woman,
unfilial and disloyal.

288
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,540
- I don't acknowledge you as my sister.
 - Don't say that.

289
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,739
Father was right about something.

290
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:37,019
When I was eight, I followed him
running shops and doing business.

291
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,759
I could work the abacus
faster than the bookkeeper.

292
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,860
If your son could achieve that,

293
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,620
you surely wouldn't live a life of hunger.

294
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,300
After all, he is loyal, filial, and reasonable.

295
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,620
Man Er is your father's only heir,

296
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,699
and will inherit the He family's business.

297
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:00,259
How could you belittle him like this?

298
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,820
When he becomes the head of the He family,

299
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,499
when we return to Luoyang, you will kneel to him.

300
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,620
This is a joke.
I have long established my household.

301
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,720
Whether he is the head of the household
has nothing to do with me.

302
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,259
You stand in the presence
of the famous Huamanzhu's owner.

303
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:20,580
And you want her to kneel?

304
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,140
Look at the words hanging on that wall.

305
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,900

306
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,100
I advise you to speak more politely.

307
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,640
You are a mere lowly maid.

308
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,699
- Who are you calling a lowly maid? No lowly maids here.
- What?

309
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:35,219
If you don't leave now,
you'll be responsible for the consequences.

310
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,739
He Wei Fang, was your conscience eaten by dogs?

311
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:42,739
If it weren't for you running away
from home back then

312
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:44,939
and taking a pot of our He family's rare peony,

313
00:23:44,939 --> 00:23:47,340
you wouldn't have had
the capital to start your fortune.

314
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,620
Now that you are prosperous,

315
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,240
you want to turn your back on your family?

316
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,920
Let me tell you.

317
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,419
Your overflowing wealth now
should have a share for the He family.

318
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,059
I started from scratch in Chang'an, facing many ups and downs.

319
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,540
I have never asked for anything from you.

320
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,300
And now you want to take a share.

321
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,000
Let me tell you, that Qiongtai Yulu
was developed by my mother,

322
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,380
and the Fragrance Garden
was the dowry she left for me.

323
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,580
If Father is in trouble,
I will discuss it with him myself.

324
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,780
But none of this has anything to do with you.

325
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,419
Someone, see the guests out.

326
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,188
I'm not leaving.

327
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,060
Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me.

328
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,799
- I'm not leaving.
- Don't touch my mom!

329
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,480
He Wei Fang, your mother did not die of illness.

330
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,120
Wait a moment.

331
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,372
What did you say?

332
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,900
Your mother did not fall ill back then,
she was poisoned.

333
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,336
Let's go.

334
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,956
Keep talking.

335
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,540
The poisoner was her enemy,
and this poison was incurable.

336
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,240
Only the Zixi pill might have saved her.

337
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,319
That's why back then your father
risked his life to find that tribute medicine.

338
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,659
Do you think I'll believe you
just because of a few sentences?

339
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,380
Mother was kind to people during her life,

340
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,300
apart from growing flowers,
she was not involved in worldly matters.

341
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,900
Why would she have any enemies?

342
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,140
That's because you don't know the truth.

343
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,759
Not only did she have an enemy,
but that person hated her deeply.

344
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,219
It seems she was aware of her heavy sins,

345
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:51,300
so she didn't tell you about it.

346
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,100
Think carefully.

347
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,359
What kind of disease would suddenly flare up?

348
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,100
And within a few short months, she passed away.

349
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,019
You have been in contact
with medicinal materials since childhood.

350
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,720
Have you ever seen such a strange illness?

351
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,900
How can you prove what you say is true?

352
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,259
I know who this person is.

353
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,620
Give me five thousand bolts of silk.

354
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,939
I will tell you this person's name.

355
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:26,319
Whether it's true or false,
you'll know once you investigate.

356
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,784
Fine, I'll do it.

357
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,332

358
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,240
This Wu Hong is from Luoyang.

359
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
He once worked as a servant
in a noble's household in Chang'an.

360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
A few years ago, he went back
to his hometown to visit relatives,

361
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,960
which was during the time
Mrs. He was ill. It checks out.

362
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,219
Before returning to Luoyang
to visit relatives, he lived in Chang'an.

363
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,060
There should be no enmity
between him and my mother.

364
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,440
Why would he harm her?

365
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,900
I wasn't able to find out.

366
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,419
However, this person is very strange.

367
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,939
After returning to Chang'an,
he disappeared for a while.

368
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,340
He even changed his name
and lived a reclusive life.

369
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,900
If he has nothing to hide, why would he do that?

370
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,499
Where is he now, and what is he doing?

371
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,820
He runs a clinic for orphans
and the sick outside the city.

372
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,659
There's nothing unusual on ordinary days.

373
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:18,699
The surrounding neighbors praise him highly.

374
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:22,419
They say he is kind and approachable,
and very good with children.

375
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,580
Do you have his portrait?

376
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,976
Mu Dan.

377
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,100
Ms. He, you're here.

378
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,440
It's cold outside.
Come in and warm yourself by the fire.

379
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,860
No need. I have something to ask you.

380
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,000
Could you please come out for a moment?

381
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,739
Kang, continue to read the legend with them.

382
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,368
Alright.

383
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,300
Is your real name Wu Hong?

384
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:42,404
Yes.

385
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:49,640
Do you know the owner
of the He's Pharmacy in Luoyang?

386
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,780
I do.

387
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:04,039
You poisoned and killed my mother, right?

388
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,240
- I did.
 - Why?

389
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,350
That year,

390
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,180
it wasn't just your mother who died.

391
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,939
That year, I learned that my home
had suffered from a flood.

392
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:34,179
So I hurried back to Luoyang
and experienced the major post-disaster epidemic.

393
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,639
I watched with open eyes

394
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,672
my parents, wife, and children

395
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,804
die in front of me.

396
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:54,179
Have you ever experienced
the despair of losing all your loved ones?

397
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,140
But what does this have to do with my mother?

398
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,839
It was poor people like us
who died from the flood.

399
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,140
It was also poor people like us
who died from the plague.

400
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,259
Those officials and wealthy businessmen
all hid in their houses to avoid the plague.

401
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,340
Even if they get sick,
they have money to buy medicine.

402
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
But what about us?

403
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,580
People like us can only wait for death.

404
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,160
How can I not hate them?

405
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,179
Do you know, the one who died in my arms last

406
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,119
was my child who hadn't even become 15.

407
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,900
She passed away with her eyes wide open,
unable to die at peace.

408
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:45,599
At that time, I was filled with hatred.

409
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:51,380
I just wanted to find someone
to accompany my family to the grave.

410
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:56,860
But how could I easily enter
those noble and wealthy households?

411
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,240
I roamed everywhere
and finally found an opportunity.

412
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,860
I entered a house.

413
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:15,079
 Your mother recognized that I was not
the usual farmer who delivered vegetables.

414
00:31:16,212 --> 00:31:18,224
 So I told her

415
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:22,820
 my family members had all died,
and I had no money for their burial.

416
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,259
 That's why I found this job.

417
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,620
 She then gave me two strings of coins.

418
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:33,659
 I didn't need her charity.

419
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,159
 I also didn't need her to pretend
to be a good person to me.

420
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:42,419
 I just want her to accompany my family in burial.

421
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,119
Your whole family died.

422
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,939
And you made my mother accompany them.

423
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,100
My mother has never harmed anyone.

424
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,559
But your family is harmonious,
while mine is broken and dead.

425
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,880
How is that fair?

426
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,699
If you want to blame anyone,
you can blame your mother for her bad luck.

427
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:21,780
My mother pitied your misfortune,
which gave you the chance to harm her.

428
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,159
You couldn't distinguish between right and wrong,
yet you still have no sense of guilt.

429
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,720
Since you have found me, it is also my fate.

430
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,179
To kill or to flay, it's up to you.

431
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:44,480
Mu Dan.

432
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,120
Sui Zhi.

433
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,000
Your mother is gone.
What's the use of killing Mr. Wu?

434
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,484
You knew.

435
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,659
Why didn't you tell me?

436
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,079
Why didn't you?

437
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,060
When will the cycle of vengeance end?

438
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,699
Even if you kill him,
your mother will not come back.

439
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,659
Jiang Chang Yang, we both have lost our mothers.

440
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:27,900
I thought you understood me.

441
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,828
Move aside.

442
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,060
Get out of my way.

443
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,656
Sui Zhi.

444
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,900
Are you crazy? Are you crazy, Jiang Chang Yang?

445
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,720
Let the past be the past.

446
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,060
Mr. Wu is also a pitiable person.

447
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,360
Mu Dan,

448
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,480
let it go.

449
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:07,680
Pitiable person?

450
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,540
Is my mother not a pitiable person?

451
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,079
When my mother was seriously ill, she told me
to treat the servants in the courtyard kindly.

452
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,419
Especially Mr. Wu.

453
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:26,579
All these years, Mr. Wu has lived a frugal life.

454
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,879
He devoted himself to taking care of the children.
He has been atoning for his sins.

455
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,200
Atonement? Can atonement
bring my mother back to life?

456
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,579
Can atonement change the fact
that he is a murderer?

457
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,340
My mother was benevolent all her life.

458
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,359
She personally made so many medicinal packets

459
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,399
and distributed them to those
who couldn't afford medical treatment.

460
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:55,240
Now the murderer of my mother is right here.

461
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,740
And you want me to let go.

462
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:05,039
I can't let go. I just can't.

463
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:24,539
These years, Mr. Wu watched me grow up.

464
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,019
He was with me when I bade farewell to my mother.

465
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:32,480
Now he is like family to me.

466
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,300
I won't let you hurt him.

467
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,670
- Ms. He.
 - Mr. Wu,

468
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,019
no need to say anything.

469
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,879
Jiang Chang Yang, now I finally realize

470
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,660
that you are unreasonable and cannot distinguish
loyalty from treachery.

471
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,600
I misjudged you before.

472
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:50,544
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

473
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:54,604
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

474
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:58,568
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

475
00:36:58,568 --> 00:37:04,552
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

476
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:08,396
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

477
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:12,620
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

478
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,524
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

479
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:20,944
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

480
00:37:25,598 --> 00:37:30,456
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

481
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:38,160
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

482
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:45,456
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

483
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:52,784
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫

484
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:02,456
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

485
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:10,136
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

486
00:38:13,516 --> 00:38:17,588
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫

487
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:26,212
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

488
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,399
Mr. Jiang, Ms. He has already
moved out of the Jiang Mansion.

489
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,099
Two guests, please come in.

490
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,139
Mom, the pharmacy is surely
short-handed right now.

491
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,139
I want to go and help out.

492
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,459
After the flood,
there are many sick people in the city.

493
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:17,419
Your father told us not to go out these days.

494
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,499
But with so many patients now,
they surely need someone to take care of them.

495
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:26,139
And yet here I am, resting easy at home.

496
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:28,760
I feel very uneasy.

497
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:35,539
Now, there are many patients
and few medicinal supplies.

498
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,820
If you catch the disease,
you'll take up an extra dose of medicine.

499
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,220
And then other patients will be short one dose.

500
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,260
Moreover, these medicinal packets we're making

501
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,760
can also contribute to the sick people.

502
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,380
Mom, you are right.

503
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,820
However, Mom, is this epidemic really that severe?

504
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,419
Under normal circumstances, it's enough
to use ordinary peonies for medicine.

505
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,419
This time we are using ice crystal peonies.

506
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,440
The flowers in the courtyard
are almost picked clean.

507
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,700
The root and bark of this flower can clear heat,
cool the blood, and alleviate various pains.

508
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,700
Combined with anemarrhena, phellodendron,
and rehmannia for medicine,

509
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,800
it can relieve lung heat.

510
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,740
It is exactly the medicine
most needed for this epidemic.

511
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,764
The ice crystal peonies we have

512
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,059
are the rarest and most hard
to find over vast distances.

513
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:28,099
In these times of disaster,
one of these is worth a fortune.

514
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:38,499
Mom, you distribute such valuable materials
to the victims who can't afford treatment.

515
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,499
Mom, you are so kind.

516
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,340
Stamping the auspicious clouds from heaven
on the medicinal packet

517
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
also serves to convey blessings.

518
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,700
Hopefully, those who take this medicine

519
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,579
can safely get through this ordeal
and stay healthy.

520
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,576
They will.

521
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:23,020

 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

535
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:36,496
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

536
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:44,752
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

537
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:53,180
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

538
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:01,080
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
