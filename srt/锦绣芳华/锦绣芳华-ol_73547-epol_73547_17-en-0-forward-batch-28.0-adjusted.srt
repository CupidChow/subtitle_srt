00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,180
In the Name of Blossom

3
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,040

4
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:30,940
Mr. Lu, rebuilding the country is our wish.

5
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,640
But your wife and children are innocent
and shouldn't have died tragically for this cause.

6
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,320
I feel sorry to you

7
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,480
and even more so, to them.

8
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,539
I cannot openly pay tribute to you.

9
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:56,760
Only with this wine, can I comfort your ambition.

10
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,779
Mr. Jiang, His Majesty's secret letter
has been sent to Hedong.

11
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:24,480
The people at Huanyun Tower have moved
to the southern outskirts as you instructed.

12
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,300
Tell Yun Niang that those in the secret guard
who have wives, children, or parents,

13
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,460
should be sent away and properly settled
before the Spring Exam.

14
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,080
Yes.

15
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,819
Mr. Jiang, you're different from Minister Lu.

16
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,619
We've prepared for the great plan for a long time,
and there will be no mistakes.

17
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,080
Is Mu Dan in the residence?

18
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,219
Mr. Jiang, you've come around?

19
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,080
Yes, I have.

20
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,600
Part ways and find happiness separately?

21
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,700

22
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,099
Mr. Jiang is determined that
it is inappropriate to further delay you, Ms. He.

23
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,260
Before you move out of the Jiang Mansion,
Mr. Jiang will not return.

24
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,659
His great endeavor
is about to be set in motion, isn't it?

25
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:55,520
For fear of an almost certain death,
he is forcing me to leave.

26
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,500
Mr. Jiang wishes for prosperity in your business
and joy in the rest of your life.

27
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I shall leave now.

28
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,900
This damp red clay is only found
in the southern outskirts of the city.

29
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,330
Stop.

30
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,100
Continue.

31
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,819
Speed up.

32
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,739
Mr. Jiang, we caught a suspicious beggar
in the mountains.

33
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,539
Not sure if he is a spy for Prince Ning.

34
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,939
- Bring him up.
 - Yes.

35
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,440
Come on.

36
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,160
Ms. He.

37
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,819
There are hidden sentries
at all the checkpoints here.

38
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:37,099
If they mistook you for Prince Ning's spy
and shot you on the spot,

39
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,539

40
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,520
From now on, don't do
such dangerous things anymore.

41
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,560
Fortunately, I came today.

42
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,490
Otherwise, I would never have known that the people in your courtyard are not secret guards

43
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,280
but death warriors.

44
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,560
They all disregard life and death,

45
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,059
- I…
 - I did not come to pester you.

46
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:28,199
I actually came to seek an answer.

47
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:36,260
But after seeing all this,
I already got the answer.

48
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,450
Jiang Chang Yang, I haven't experienced your past,

49
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,380
nor have I stood in your position

50
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,920
or understood the heavy responsibility you bear.

51
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,460
But since I am fond of you, even if I don't agree with your decision,

52
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,060
I will respect your choice.

53
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:10,100
Don't worry, I will sign and seal
the Concubine Release Document.

54
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,679
Just have Chuan Yu come to pick it up.

55
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Thank you.

56
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,710
Also, if your endeavor with His Majesty needs me,

57
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,000
feel free to tell me at any time.

58
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,419
Rest assured. I'm not doing this
for romantic affairs.

59
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:53,240
Only because I am the owner of Wuyong Hall.

60
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,439
Okay.

61
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm off.

62
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:29,188
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

63
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:33,148
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

64
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:37,116
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

65
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:42,212
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

66
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:47,298
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

67
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,259
When you first received this hairpin,
it was broken.

68
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,390
Perhaps at that time

69
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,820
the end was already decided.

70
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:09,287
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫

 ♫ May the heart be fearless ♫

77

 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

80

 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫

82
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:27,832
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

83
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,850

84
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Mu Dan.

85
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,780
Is the cargo list for
the Flower Boat Tour ready? Let me see it.

86
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,579
- Mu Dan.
 - The Flower Boat Tour is near.

87
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:12,020
This is important for Huamanzhu and Wuyong Hall.
No mistakes can be made.

88
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,240
I need to take a good look.

89
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,020
After the tour,

90
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,579
the flower boat of Wuyong Hall and Huamanzhu
will head south, offering help along the way.

91
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:32,740
Ms. He will also go with the boat
to open a branch shop in the South.

92
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,260
This has been something she wanted to do.

93
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,120
She'll stop at each place along the water route, and when she returns,

94
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,480
the affairs of the court should have reached a conclusion.

95
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:50,380
But I heard from a staff member that Ms. He
has taken all her belongings with her.

96
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,919
There is no set date for her return. She may stay
in the south to oversee the branch shop.

97
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,100
She might also travel for leisure
after setting up the shop.

98
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,660
Mr. Jiang, this farewell
may mean you will not meet again.

99
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,779
Mountains are high and waters are long.

100
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,539
Mr. Jiang, if you regret it in the future,
you might not even be able to find her.

101
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:16,319
If anything happens to her in Chang'an,
I would more than just regret it.

102
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,559
I am reluctant, but I cannot afford to gamble.

103
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,330
If she can roam freely out there,

104
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,490
that would be great.

105
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,420
Well, I'll go get the Concubine Release Document.

106
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:51,140
When the tour ends, I'll go see her off.

107
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,140
Then, I'll personally ask her for it.

108
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Come and take a look.

109
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,860
Lv's Flower Shop thanks everyone
for your support throughout the year.

110
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,340
May the flowers be
even more beautiful than last year.

111
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,779
Great!

112
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,019
Please support us more and take a look.

113
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,179
Good!

114
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,290
- Great.
 - Great.

115
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,190

- Great.
- Great.

117
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:22,419
Great.

118
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:28,220
Huamanzhu stands in Chang'an
thanks to the support and care of our clients.

119
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,759
The newly established Wuyong Hall uses flowers as medicine and offers medical consultations.

120
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,260
We hope the fragrance spreads far and wide.

121
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,020
Today, we prepared sea pomegranate wine with goji
that dispels cold and promotes blood circulation.

122
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,559
Everyone is welcome to taste it
and celebrate today together.

123
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,500
Amazing.

124
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,740
Help yourselves.

125
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,950
Nice.

Various kinds of flower seeds.
The more you buy, the more gifts you get.

Petal sachets, available while stocks last.

Petal sachets.

144
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,780
Mu Dan, Jiang Chang Yang hasn't sent anyone
to pick up the Concubine Release Document yet.

145
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,880
How about I take a pot of wine to hurry him up?

146
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,819
No problem, after I leave,
you can pass it on to him for me.

147
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,519
- Alright.
 - Lady He, one set of herbal plaster.

148
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,780
Alright, today our herbal plaster
and rheumatic plaster are ten wen cheaper.

149
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,340
I remember, sir,
that you used this prescription before.

150
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,759
Why not stock up on a few more today?

151
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,699
Alright, I'll take five more sets of each.

152
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,699
Alright, Liu Lang, go get the goods.

153
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,299
Alright.

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,459
Thank you.

155
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,459
Here's your wine.

156
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,580
Firework signal?

157
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,370
You mean that when we encounter danger next time,

158
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,420
you will come after seeing this?

159
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,150
Don't be upset.

160
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,140
At worst, we'll start over.

161
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,870
I'll be with you.

162
00:19:57,499 --> 00:20:01,480
Then I will take it seriously.

163
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:28,780
The moon in the water,

164
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,580
No matter how carefully you try to hold it

165
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,739
it will slip away bit by bit.

166
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
You've had too much to drink.

167
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,520
It's getting late and cold.
Let's go back to the cabin.

168
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,200
I've signed the Concubine Release Document.

169
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,900
I wish you peace, success,
and great achievements in the future.

170
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,440
Tomorrow, I will leave Chang'an.

171
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,739
Going south to do business is a good thing.

172
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:15,839
Understanding all things and traveling
the world. How free-spirited.

173
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:21,019
This is your dream.

174
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,539
You were once my dream, too.

175
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:33,459
So tonight, I've come to see you off.

176
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:44,540
Alright, since it's a farewell,
why not have a drink before leaving?

177
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,720
I've prepared the wine.

178
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,040
This is the wine your mother prepared
for your wedding.

179
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,720
Our marriage is fake, so why waste it?

180
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,839
After this wine, you will achieve great feats,
and I will travel the world.

181
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,119
We will part ways peacefully.

182
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:28,240
I am aware of what happened with Minister Lu.

183
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:37,480
I will not let the same thing happen to you.

184
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,419
Everyone says he and Madam Lu are deeply in love.

185
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:46,340
But if Madam Lu had known
about this disaster in advance,

186
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,979
would she still choose to marry
Minister Lu and have children with him?

187
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:57,219
No one can make a conclusion on this matter.
Only Madam Lu knows the answer in her heart.

188
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,140
Similarly, you have never asked me either.

189
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,179
I can't be that selfish.

190
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,140
But you cannot make choices for me even more.

191
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,380
Back then at Pei Zhong's villa,

192
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,860
if I had really died, would you have regretted it

193
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,000
that you didn't tell me your feelings earlier
and let me die with regrets?

194
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:29,750
Everyone is destined to die.

195
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,100
But if one cannot hear heartfelt words
from their beloved before dying,

196
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,960
that's truly a life lived in vain.

197
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,739
You know my feelings.

198
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:45,599
But I want to hear it from you.

199
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:51,900
Even if tonight, we separate
and never meet again in this life,

200
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,979
I will have no regrets.

201
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,259
Yes, you are in my heart.

202
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:09,399
I love you more than my own life,
so I must let you go.

203
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:12,820
I can't afford those "what ifs".

204
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,440
What if I die before you,
making you suffer for the rest of your life?

205
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:21,300
What if I can't protect you
and cause you to die with me?

206
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,620
Do you think I am the kind of person
who would hang myself if I lost my husband?

207
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,480
Or do you think I am too fragile
to protect myself?

208
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,659
Listen.

209
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,819
Since I dared to choose you,
I can bear the possibility of losing you one day.

210
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,459
Wuyong Hall and Qingshuzhai will go South,
opening branches everywhere.

211
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:49,419
In terms of devotion to serve the country,
I am not inferior to you.

212
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:55,020
I can be your confidence.
We can clearly achieve both.

213
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,860
Why do you forsake the happiness we can have
for the sake of unknown fears?

214
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:20,200
I've heard your true words tonight.

215
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:24,159
You can go now.

216
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,162
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

217
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:36,096
 ♫ Traversing dangers is not in vain ♫

218
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:38,820
 ♫ There are thousands of thoughts ♫

219
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,480
Sea pomegranate wine? You've been here all night.

220
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,860
 ♫ If love is like frost ♫

221
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,200
And I will be here from now on.

222
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,620
 ♫ Flowers bloom and wither I only wish that you Remain unscathed ♫

223
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:04,516
 ♫ Looking back I see high mountains And long waters ♫

224
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:16,179
Ms. He finally dispelled Mr. Jiang's doubts.

225
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:21,139
What are you talking about? Clearly,
Mr. Jiang is reluctant to let go of Mu Dan.

226
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,739
I'll go in place of Mu Dan for the business trip.

227
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,499
I've packed my luggage and will travel
with Ms. Sun and the others.

228
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,739
It's perfect for me to go out for some experience.

229
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,900
While I'm gone, you must take good care of Mu Dan.

230
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,739
Don't let her be bullied by Mr. Jiang.

231
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:41,380
Don't worry. All right, let's eat quickly.
Everyone worked hard today.

232
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,179
- Come on, let's dig in.
- This is delicious.

233
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:46,099
- Liu Lang, eat more meat.
 - Thank you.

234
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,620
Jiang Chang Yang.

235
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,280
Jiang Chang Yang.

236
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,150
Mu Dan. Mu Dan,

237
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,580
I made jiaozi for you all.
Come and try them.

238
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,780
Fu,

239
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,900
where is he?

240
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,820
- He…
- If he dares to leave you, I'll smash his house.

241
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,420
Take this.

242
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,679
Girls!

243
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,919
Where is Jiang Chang Yang?

244
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,919
He's in the backyard.

245
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,739
I've wanted to punch him
for a long time, just watch.

246
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,540
Today, I'm going to pinch his ankle.
I'm going to squeeze his nape.

247
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,780
I'll give him a good beating first.

248
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:23,179
Did Jiang Chang Yang get ready
with everything for ending it?

249
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,979
How dare he?

250
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:35,580
What are you doing?

251
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,800
What are you doing?

252
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:44,330
We gambled that the first to marry is a dog.

253
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,520
Now, I concede.

254
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,480
Please accept these gambling winnings, my lady.

255
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,800
So much money.

256
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,179
Weren't they already married?
Why give her the money today?

257
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:13,780
If you came back for the money,
didn't you say so beforehand?

258
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,080
You were sleeping so soundly.
How could I bear to wake you up?

259
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,580
I just thought that if you woke up and saw so much money,

260
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,760
you would be happier.

261
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,699
Don't talk nonsense. Everyone is here.

262
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,780
Let's go back first.

263
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,580
Let's go.

264
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,039
Come on. Stop looking and hurry up.

265
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:51,380
Wasn't it all confiscated before?
Where did so much money come from?

266
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,919
What corrupt official
doesn't have multiple hiding places?

267
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,100
Did you only come back for the money?

268
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,440
I got up early and even made a trip to the palace.

269
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,380
I have arranged it with Mr. Third.

270
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,359
Once we purge Prince Ning's faction, he'll give me
a position that allows for inspections everywhere.

271
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,640
Wherever your shop opens, I'll follow.

272
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,319
In the future, you won't be able to shake me off
even if you wanted to. Don't regret it.

273
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,879
I won't regret it for this wager I won.

274
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,039
You aggressively brought people
to storm the Jiang Mansion.

275
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,380
Do you think I regretted it after sobering up?

276
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,480
I didn't.

277
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,140
Tell me, were you trying to scare me on purpose?

278
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,280
How could I? Moving so much money
made my hands sore.

279
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,240
Jiang Chang Yang, what are you doing?

280
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,440
It's broad daylight. Put me down.

281
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,359
Put me down, I'll walk myself. What are you doing?

282
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,639
What are you doing?

283
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,259
If you get angry someday and take it out on this,

284
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:27,219
there's still half left.

285
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:32,040
This way, you won't regret and feel sad
to find the token destroyed after you calm down.

286
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,199
I wasn't taking it out on it.

287
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,480
I just saw that you couldn't let go of me
but were too afraid to be with me.

288
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,220
So I helped you cut off the thoughts.

289
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,939
This way, you won't feel sad every night,
holding this hairpin.

290
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:56,519
Yes, yes, Lady He is the most decisive.
How could I escape from your clutches?

291
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:02,579
From now on, you can't escape anymore.
Don't push me away.

292
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,720
And don't leave me.

293
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:24,080
I wasn't acting impulsively from drunkenness.
I will cherish my life more for you.

294
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,779
It looks good.

295
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,450
Do you like it?

296
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,999
It's quite unique.

297
00:36:57,336 --> 00:37:04,410
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

298
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:12,710
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

299
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:18,919
Who says encounter is easy?
This joy is truly precious.

300
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:25,299
I, Jiang Chang Yang, swear to the heavens,
will become husband and wife with He Wei Fang.

301
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:31,039
For all my life, I will never fail you.

302
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,619
Among all the fish in the sea,
I have my eyes on a particular one.

303
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,939
Time flows like a river.

304
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:50,740
I, He Wei Fang, in hardship or in happiness,

305
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,039
will have no regrets for today's choice.

306
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:02,260
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

307
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:11,167
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

308
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:14,939
Wait, Jiang Chang Yang.

309
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,779
In the past, our marriage was fake,
and there was no real wedding night.

310
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:29,560
Today, I specifically sought out this pair
of dragon and phoenix candles from Mr. Third.

311
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,514
Before the candles burn out,
none of us is allowed to leave this room.

312
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:43,776
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

313
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:50,496
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

314
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,520

315
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,700
This is it, Yangu Inn.

316
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,579
We're finally here.

317
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,210
You're here.

318
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,740
I am Zhang Qian, the county sage from Yangzhou.

319
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,920
This is Ma Di from Xuanzhou
and Luo Ning from Taiyuan.

320
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,960
More than ten county sages from Luoyang
have already stayed at the lodge.

321
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,660
Are you Zhang Qian?
I was fortunate to have read your poems.

322
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,419
Truly, your literary talent is outstanding.

323
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,139
Let me show you around. Come this way.

324
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:19,619
Please.

325
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,820
Mr. Liu, when will His Highness return?

326
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,459
We must see His Highness today to be at ease.

327
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,639
Have you read the strategic proposals
written by common scholars from various places?

328
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,340
If His Highness doesn't take this seriously,

329
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,959
I'm afraid the young men from noble families
will find it hard to have a bright future.

330
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,459
Everyone, everyone, please be patient.

331
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:47,680
His Highness is not at the residence
precisely because he's seeking solutions for you.

332
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,740
When will there be an update?

333
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,260
There are only a few days left
until the Spring Exam.

334
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,120
Everyone, you can't solely rely on His Highness.

335
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,220
After all, this concerns
the future of your own sons.

336
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,760
Mr. Zhu, as the Minister of Agriculture,
dealing with a few poor scholars should be easy.

337
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,280
I am in charge of warehouses,
not their examination papers.

338
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:21,780
The Spring Exam is approaching,
and it's the perfect time to study and prepare.

339
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,519
It's just a pity that the days are short and the nights are long.

340
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,860
As soon as dusk falls, the lights must be lit.

341
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,519
Mr. Liu, do you mean

342
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:40,459
to have Father cut off the lamp oil and edible oil
from the markets, so they can't study and prepare?

343
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:44,019
The Minister of Agriculture is supposed
to regularly inspect warehouses.

344
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:49,040
It wouldn't be excessive to inspect
until the civil service exam results are posted.

345
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,860
I have already spoken to people
in charge of various pastures.

346
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,900
From today, all kinds of poultry
also need to be inspected.

347
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:02,860
Without access to the markets,
they can't even make oil on their own.

348
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:14,990

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining

350
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:31,163
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

351
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:39,677
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

352
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:47,769
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

353
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:56,121
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

354
00:41:56,121 --> 00:42:04,318
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

355
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:12,605
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

356
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:21,021
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

357
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:29,021
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

358
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:57,073
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

359
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:04,524
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

360
00:43:04,524 --> 00:43:12,610
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

361
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:20,819
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

362
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:29,081
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

363
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:37,337
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

364
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:45,765
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

365
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:53,765
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
