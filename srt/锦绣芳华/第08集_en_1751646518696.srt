high

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,540
How could they sneak into the house?

20
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Besides,

21
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,540
someone reported the missing.

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,540
I think it's the bandits

23
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,540
who are lying.

24
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,540
They said

25
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
the fire was rare.

26
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,540
They hid it before the fire.

27
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,540
We'll bring them up later.

28
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
When the fire is over,

29
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
it will be clear.

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,540
The bandits are so good

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,540
Why did they burn your yard?

32
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
They were hired by someone

33
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
to do business.

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,540
Who dared to harm my garden?

35
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,540
Your Majesty,

36
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,540
the bandits said

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
it was Lady Ji'an.

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
I've never seen her.

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
It's a slander.

41
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm a noble woman.

42
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
I don't know anything about the fire.

43
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,540
There must be a misunderstanding.

44
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
I believe

45
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
you don't.

46
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,540
The bandits have no truth.

47
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
I'm afraid they stole the fire

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
to frame you.

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,540
But

50
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,540
there are only 50 barrels of fuel left.

51
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
There's no match.

52
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
I don't know

53
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
how much they stole.

54
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,540
If they hide it,

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,540
they will be in danger.

56
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,540
If they have other accomplices,

57
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,540
Chang'an will be in danger.

58
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Leave it to the Ministry of Justice.

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,540
The Ministry of Justice will investigate it.

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
The fire will be put out one day.

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
Whoever has been in the warehouse for a long time

62
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
will be killed.

63
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
The bandits have no accomplices.

64
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
If they hide anything dangerous,

65
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,540
they will be found out.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,540
No more investigation.

68
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
I did it.

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
Your Majesty,

70
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
I was angry at you

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
for not taking care of my ex-wife.

72
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
I was angry at you

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
for not taking care of my ex-wife.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
I stole the fuel from your warehouse

75
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,540
and set the fire on the square.

76
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,540
Youzhen,

77
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
you're confused.

78
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,540
Now the Ministry of Justice is involved.

79
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
I don't want to make the same mistake.

80
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
I'm sorry for my father's ignorance.

81
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,540
I'm sorry for my father's ignorance.

82
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
I'm afraid

83
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
I can't make up for it.

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
Please forgive me.

85
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Liu Chang was looking for me for no reason.

86
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Now the County Master has set the fire on my yard.

87
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,540
You and your husband are against each other.

88
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Is it because I and Mudan are too close to each other

89
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,540
that the money is being used to cover up?

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
Your Majesty, you have to help me.

91
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Otherwise, I will not dare to enter the main gate of the Ningguang Mansion.

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,540
Your Majesty, thank you.

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,540
Liu Chang's father's death

94
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
has no value.

95
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
All right.

96
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
I understand your waste of energy

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
will use in anything.

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
My控marke shall not step up

99
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,540
until I find him.

100
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
He is an auspicious man.

101
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Later Famouso

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
will take down the horses ofcesses.

103
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Keep2019

104
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,540
safe from others.

105
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,540
The fire was deliberately set on the way.

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,540
The path should be left 2,000 miles away for three years.

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,540
Okay.

108
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,540
But since you took the initiative to confess your crime,

109
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
the punishment is easy.

110
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
How about...

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,540
...using the punishment as a small punishment?

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
What do you think, Your Majesty?

113
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Are you fond of me?

114
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,540
Definitely.

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,540
I love you like crazy example of home.

116
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Your brother clearly mentioned for you

117
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
his kinship with woman.

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,640
Of course I can help.

119
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,580
Your Majesty is wise.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,920
It's okay as long as you just now try to set up the roof.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,000
The construction and construction of the waters by the state arrangements,

122
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,280
I will send a letter like this tomorrow.

123
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,920
Thank You, Your Majesty!

124
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,300
and leave the house touchy,

125
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:56,200
The

126
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,000
End doll

127
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,860
He was found and dragged into a depressive abyss.

128
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,860
she is College

129
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:55,300
Javelin

130
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,580
Did they burn those diagnosis papers when they fill them into the swwwre?

131
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,740
Maybe we could inform the young soldiers.

132
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,860
The members of the Triad Crown have informational skills,

133
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,900
and they are always promoted to mlads.

134
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
Well...

135
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,620
Ready.

136
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,500
Well, you are lucky.

137
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,780
The fire of prestige religions begins to ignite.

138
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,180
And it institute you, Li Youzhen.

139
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,200
So, lies word about nuclear material

140
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,720
andversity.

141
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Even if I suffer a punishment, what can I do?

142
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
I am the current queen.

143
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
As long as I think about it,

144
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
you think you can live?

145
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
You knew I had no intention to leave when Luoyang joined hands.

146
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Why did you harm me again and again?

147
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Because of you.

148
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Because of you, I can't get pregnant.

149
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Because of you, Zishu doesn't want to see me.

150
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Do you know the feeling of separation of husband and wife is worse than death?

151
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Zishu can't let you go.

152
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
You are a sinner if you live.

153
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
But I didn't do it alone.

154
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,900
What did those innocent people in the courtyard do wrong?

155
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Those ants are only fit to be your prey.

156
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Death has nothing to do with me.

157
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,900
In your eyes, the common people are all ants.

158
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,900
But the queen's clothes and food are all made of ants.

159
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
For a person who doesn't love you,

160
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,900
you are so stubborn that you become a monster.

161
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Don't you feel sad?

162
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,900
If you have no obsession, you can play the piano.

163
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
You don't know what I've been through before.

164
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
It's not easy to live a peaceful life.

165
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Some people are considered to be a chess piece for power.

166
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,900
And some people can only play the music of the same man.

167
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Some people are even called a woman with a bad reputation.

168
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
There are many times when we have no choice.

169
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,900
In this case, no matter how good the woman is,

170
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
she will always be a woman.

171
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,900
If so, why don't you live for yourself when you have a choice?

172
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Instead, you have to make it difficult for each other.

173
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
If you are too strong, you will die.

174
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,900
The world is not only lovely, but also desirable.

175
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
I hope you can do well.

176
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Don't hurt people.

177
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Don't hurt people.

178
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Don't hurt people.

179
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Don't hurt people.

180
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Don't hurt people.

181
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Don't hurt people.

182
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Don't hurt people.

183
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Don't hurt people.

184
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Don't hurt people.

185
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Don't hurt people.

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Don't hurt people.

187
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Don't hurt people.

188
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Don't hurt people.

189
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Don't hurt people.

190
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Don't hurt people.

191
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Don't hurt people.

192
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Don't hurt people.

193
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Don't hurt people.

194
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Don't hurt people.

195
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Don't hurt people.

196
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
You've worked hard these days, uncle.

197
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Thank you for helping me move.

198
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
It's okay.

199
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
When we got married, Jiang's last name was Tianyan.

200
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
It was a very bad name.

201
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
It was only a few days before we got engaged.

202
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
You worked so hard to earn so much for him.

203
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
He didn't treat you well, and you left.

204
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
You're heartless.

205
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
You misunderstood.

206
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Jiang Chanyong didn't drive me away.

207
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I wanted to leave.

208
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
It had nothing to do with him.

209
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
When did you help him?

210
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
It's true.

211
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
Jiang Chanyong is not that kind of person.

212
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
He said Mudan was useless.

213
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
He was so afraid of living.

214
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
But he risked his life for me.

215
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
There are many things between us.

216
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Only we know.

217
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Anyway, he's a very good person.

218
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
There are too many people who misunderstand him.

219
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Don't blame him.

220
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
It's hard to understand a man and a woman.

221
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
But since you said it, I believe you.

222
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
I hope you won't be too sad.

223
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
You should be better.

224
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Don't worry. I'm fine.

225
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
The End

226
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
The End

227
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
The End

228
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
The End

229
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Jiang Jun, do you regret leaving?

230
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Do you regret leaving?

231
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Give me the things.

232
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Go inside and see if there's anything left.

233
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Go.

234
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
I'll pack up.

235
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
These are the things from the house.

236
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I'll pack up.

237
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
I'll take the letter.

238
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
You need to fill out the form.

239
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
I'll do it now. Where's the pen?

240
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
I didn't prepare it.

241
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
What do you mean?

242
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
You're getting married soon.

243
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm staying in the mansion.

244
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
It's not appropriate.

245
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
Don't worry. I'll explain to Xue Xi.

246
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I won't let her misunderstand us.

247
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
When am I getting married to Xue Xi?

248
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm just a brother and sister.

249
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
You're leaving because of this?

250
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
It's not just about this.

251
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
It's not just about this.

252
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
No matter what,

253
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
it's all a misunderstanding.

254
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
The Princess Royal didn't get married.

255
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I won't marry Xue Xi.

256
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I've driven all the people who made the sword away.

257
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
As long as the Jiang Mansion is here,

258
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
this house will always be yours.

259
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
You know

260
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
I'll never marry anyone

261
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
in this life.

262
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
I'll never marry anyone.

263
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Do you really

264
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
not have anyone in your heart?

265
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
No.

266
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Aren't you minut wenn you know?

267
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,060
Yes.

268
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,900
I'm really rice His Majesty,

269
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
you said.

270
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Mr. Ning and Li You Zhen

271
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,900
are so��면

272
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm afraid that you're not safe.

273
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I know.

274
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
This is the best way.

275
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I can only let you suffer for a while.

276
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
This letter, you keep it.

277
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,900
In the future, you'll be safe.

278
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
But the sun will rise at any time.

279
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
The day will come.

280
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
The general is so kind.

281
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Why should I suffer?

282
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
If there is any noise at the port,

283
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
the general will be caught by Prince Ning.

284
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
The fire will rise.

285
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
We should be careful.

286
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Since we'll continue to act,

287
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
we should be careful.

288
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
I'll show you how to act.

289
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
You're not afraid of me.

290
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
I'm not afraid of you.

291
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
I'm not afraid of you.

292
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
If we're acting,

293
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,900
how can we keep the evidence?

294
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
How is my injury?

295
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
The medicine given by the doctor has been taken.

296
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
The doctor said it won't leave a scar.

297
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I feel sorry for what I've done.

298
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,900
And you're the only one who can make up for it.

299
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,900
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
I understand.

303
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
I'll accompany Youchen.

304
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
King,

305
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
YouChen has been punished.

306
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Now, the war has got even stronger.

307
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
We can styled the gas chamber outside the city

308
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
and하다 a term.

309
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Do you believe

310
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
it won't be a big problem?

311
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,780
Move!

312
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,940
Comrades!

313
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,620
What's that?

314
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,500
Our soldiers were sitting outside the city to

315
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,480
hotel for the safety of each other and

316
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,900
it took place last night on the battlefield.

317
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,600
It's an emergency situation.

318
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,220
Hard fire.

319
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,900
Comrades!

320
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,420
Power!

321
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,700
Power.

322
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,700
He doesn't care about his own memory.

323
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
It's better to talk about your heart.

324
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
It's better to talk about your heart.

325
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
Jiang Changyang is trying to win the beauty.

326
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
It seems impossible.

327
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,700
But the result is that he is not worthy of the title.

328
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,700
What you said is right.

329
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,700
Whether he is on purpose or not, he has to check.

330
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
You are wise.

331
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Jiang Changyang has been in the loop for many years.

332
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Everyone is against him.

333
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
If it's all a disguise,

334
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,700
how can he be not afraid of people when he is close to the saint?

335
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
You have a stomachache?

336
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
You have no wine.

337
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
You have to think for your husband.

338
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,700
You...

339
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Don't worry, my lady.

340
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
You are going to drink the diet food.

341
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
It will make your stomach hurt.

342
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
It will make your stomach hurt even more.

343
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
Diet food is not good for stomach.

344
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Diet food is not good for stomach.

345
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
It's from Sanjiu.

346
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
The remains of the Yan State.

347
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Where do you think the traces of this book are?

348
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
It was because of the Chief Princess.

349
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
We couldn't find the house.

350
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
It's not possible to find the place with the new spies.

351
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Now the only person who knows the most about this house is...

352
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
In order to make up for the mistakes,

353
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Lian Zhou went to the Pei's house to serve.

354
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,700
The valuable gifts he got before were taken away.

355
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
Only these are left.

356
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Lian Zhou didn't like it.

357
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
He cried all day in the Jiang's house.

358
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,700
He came to see the scenery and draw the mountains.

359
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,860
The

360
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Consort Shu, how is your sleep?

361
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
Your Majesty,

362
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
I slept for four hours every night.

363
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
I also had a lot of sleep.

364
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
I'm relieved.

365
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
After giving birth, the stomach is weak.

366
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
The sky is warm, but not cold.

367
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Eat less ice.

368
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Remember to make him hot soup before bed.

369
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm going home.

370
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Chen양

371
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Pretty with her.

372
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I can't help it.

373
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I'll play another game.

374
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Are you playing chess or playing yammy?

375
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
You're so tall and tall.

376
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
You're not only talented.

377
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
You're also very talented.

378
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
You're a real genius.

379
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
You're so sweet today.

380
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Did you do something to please me?

381
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm not...

382
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I'm not a genius.

383
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
I can't find someone to do that.

384
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm not doing that.

385
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
You're not a genius.

386
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm not.

387
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
You're not a genius.

388
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm not.

389
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm not.

390
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm not.

391
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
I'm not.

392
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
I'm not.

393
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm not.

394
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,700
I'm not.

395
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
I know.

396
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,180
You look so strange today.

397
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,660
Did something happen in the palace?

398
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,060
Speaking of the palace,

399
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,100
I'm worried about Consort Shu.

400
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
What happened to her?

401
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,900
She has a strange disease.

402
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
She's very anxious.

403
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
She needs a good doctor.

404
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
She needs a medicine.

405
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,900
But it's hard to find this medicine.

406
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,620
What medicine is that?

407
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
The King's visit

408
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Here's the medicine.

409
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Your Majesty, the King's visit.

410
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Your Majesty,

411
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
kill me.

412
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
If I don't die,

413
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
the King's blood

414
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
will be stained with the sword.

415
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I'm willing to die

416
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
to prove to Your Majesty

417
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
that I'm alive.

418
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Your Majesty,

419
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,100
the Prime Minister is a great man.

420
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
You can't kill me.

421
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Your Majesty,

422
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
three times.

423
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
All these years,

424
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I've been living and studying.

425
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Sui Zhi,

426
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
I propose a toast to you.

427
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
You Zhen and Zi Shu

428
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
have spared your life.

429
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
This good wine and good food

430
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
and this good play

431
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
can make Sui Zhi sad.

432
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Don't be jealous of me.

433
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Your Majesty, you're too kind.

434
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
You think of me everywhere.

435
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
How can I blame you?

436
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Let's drink this cup

437
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
instead of these unhappy people.

438
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Drink.

439
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
I heard from my brother

440
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
that Sui Zhi has prepared a gift for you.

441
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
So many scented candles.

442
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
I thought they would be for the beauty.

443
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,100
But who knew it was these puppets.

444
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
I heard that Sui Zhi likes to see.

445
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
I just got one.

446
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
I brought it to Jiangfu Palace.

447
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Do you like it?

448
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

449
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
But I prefer

450
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
the play of the talented.

451
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
These men are too funny.

452
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
They are not interesting.

453
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,100
The Prime Minister is here.

454
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Prime Minister Li

455
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
has been the father of the emperors

456
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
and has been the supervisor of the state.

457
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
He has done a lot for the country.

458
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
But in the end

459
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
he has come to this.

460
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
It's a pity

461
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
that he is not here.

462
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
I don't like the emperors.

463
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
They are cruel

464
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
and they are ungrateful.

465
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
I think that Prime Minister Li

466
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
is a good man.

467
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,100
I have a sense of regret.

468
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
I am old.

469
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I should

470
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
retire.

471
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Your Majesty, you are worried.

472
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
His Majesty and you are close friends.

473
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,100
How can we compare the emperors and the Prime Minister?

474
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Your Majesty.

475
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Your Majesty.

476
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Your Majesty.

477
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Your Majesty.

478
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
These years

479
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I have been worried about you.

480
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
The officials in the court

481
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
have been making a fuss about me.

482
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
The officials of the state have not been at ease.

483
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,100
I can't live without you.

484
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
You are connected with me.

485
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,100
I will help you.

486
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Your Majesty, the court is full of troubles.

487
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
The household affairs are not stable.

488
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
I am very worried.

489
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
I don't know what to do.

490
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
We have been talking

491
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,100
for a long time.

492
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
You are so kind.

493
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Your Majesty.

494
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
I know what she wants.

495
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
My little lamb!

496
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,380
You are back at home.

497
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Your Majesty.

498
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Here.

499
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Your Majesty.

500
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
have it.

501
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I have some good wine.

502
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,820
No need to trouble the king, I'll go.

503
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,320
Okay.

504
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,820
Who knows?

505
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Jiangfu is not a palace of the gods.

506
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,900
Can't my people even find the wine?

507
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,560
Kill!

508
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Thank you, king!

509
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
My brother.

510
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
I'm drunk.

511
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Yes, sir.

512
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,340
Brother!

513
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,700
We are invited by His Majesty to come here.

514
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,780
Yes.

515
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,060
Today is a good day.

516
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,180
I'll play a song for His Majesty and His Majesty.

517
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,980
It's a good time to drink.

518
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,020
Go.

519
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,100
Bring me my zither.

520
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,740
Yes.

521
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,140
徐宇

522
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,260
It's a commod характер that wise mean this.

523
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,580
This two Dry's structures are equal.

524
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,420
Its windows are close to Endor total of a theater,

525
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,000
an goggles to East tuned by the Main Wall.

526
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The time is different.

527
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm afraid there's nothing under the wall.

528
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,320
Your Majesty, please allow me to go to Jiangfu.

529
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,080
Deputy Commander Liu,

530
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,560
the second door of the second door is the same as the fourth.

531
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,920
The guest room is the same.

532
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,760
Deputy Commander Liu,

533
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,680
the good wine from Jiangfu is here.

534
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
You can choose.

535
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,280
You don't have to be so impulsive.

536
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,000
I've been drinking for years,

537
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,200
and I've been hiding for too long.

538
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm afraid you might miss something.

539
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll go find some people myself.

540
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,440
This place is close to the house of the young mistress.

541
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,960
The young mistress has been having a headache

542
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,880
because of the re-construction of the house.

543
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,440
She can't hear the noise.

544
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,640
Deputy Commander Liu, if you want to listen to the story,

545
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,840
I'll ask the young mistress to...

546
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
Why are you so ill?

547
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,480
You should take good care of yourself.

548
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
Deputy Commander Liu.

549
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,120
If I were you,

550
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:32,120
fills would be ready

551
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
You are not respecting the master's family.

552
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
You don't respect the king.

553
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
I don't dare.

554
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,120
But because there are so many things in the mansion,

555
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,120
I'm afraid that Master Liu will be very angry.

556
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll take care of it.

557
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
No need. Search.

558
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Search.

559
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,120
The music of the mouth is getting more and more interesting.

560
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Brother, don't just listen to the music.

561
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Drink.
