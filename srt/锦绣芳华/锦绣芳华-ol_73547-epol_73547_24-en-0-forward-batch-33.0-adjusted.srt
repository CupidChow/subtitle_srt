1
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:13,000

2
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,759
Mr. Lv, come here.

3
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,040
Mr. Lv. Over here, Mr. Lv.

4
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,679
Our previous plan isn't perfect.

5
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,399
What do you think they're doing?

6
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,599
Fu, what are you sneaking around
and talking about?

7
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,760
We...

8
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,520
Behind! Behind you.

9
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Look over there.

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,759
So Guild Head Lv has set his sights
on Li Xing as his son-in-law!

11
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,799
Exactly!

12
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,199
Wait, Chun's whole focus is on healing people.

13
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,039
I've never seen her show interest in romance.

14
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,000
Ma'am, weren't you the same before?

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,319
Then, Mr. Jiang won you over
through grand gestures and devotion...

16
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,800
Mu Dan, we've prepared a surprise for Chun.

17
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,880
We'll need your help to trick her into attending.

18
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,280
Alright.

19
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,520
Don't tell anyone!

20
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,919
But... everyone just heard it.

21
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,120
Just keep quiet about it!

22
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:57,759
A mandate from Heaven, legitimate and justified.

23
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,680
A mandate from heaven!

24
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,799
I've brought you to this ruin. Why hesitate now?

25
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:53,039
You're facing death. Do you have any regrets?

26
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:04,799
My whole life... has been filled with regret.

27
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,640
That's why I became like this.

28
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,720
I don't want to live the way I did before.

29
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:26,800
Whether alive or dead, you'll be free.
But what about me?

30
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,720
If you hate me, just kill me.

31
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,639
Why did you betray my father?

32
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,640
If you've rebelled against him,
why plead with His Majesty to spare my life?

33
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't hate you. We're the same.

34
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,280
I hate your father.

35
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,280
He broke my leg and destroyed my integrity.

36
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,320
He ruined my path to becoming an honest official.

37
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:39,760
With such a father,
could I ever find happiness in marriage?

38
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,759
Even if his crimes are unforgivable,
he's still my father.

39
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:59,839
I can't hate him.
I'm not worthy to be his daughter.

40
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,608
I can't personally kill my enemy,

41
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,080
nor can I bring myself to stop loving you.

42
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:28,639
Liu Chang, I've destroyed your life.

43
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,720
And my life ended in your hands.

44
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,839
From now on, we're even.

45
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,959
You Zhen.

46
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,039
You Zhen!

47
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,760
All past debts between us are cleared.

48
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,640
From today onward, commoner Liu Chang

49
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:31,199
shall live with my wife You Zhen
in simple contentment

50
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
and peacefully spend our remaining years.

51
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:56,296

52
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:08,616

53
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,176

54
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,200
If you need a consultation, please come inside.

55
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
Yes, everyone, please come in.

56
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
Please come in. Watch your step.

57
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Does it look nice?

58
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,320
- It's the same color as your dress.
- I like this one.

59
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,159
- Alright, let's take both.
- Okay.

60
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,879
Don't you want to buy one for fun?

61
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,159
- Thank you, Lady Zhu Fu.
- Here you go, Shopkeeper.

62
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,919
My salary is limited,
so I'll skip the children's toys.

63
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,720
Try it.

64
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,399
I want that one.

65
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
Hand it over. Here you go.

66
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,240
I knew you'd be the best, Fu.

67
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
- Mr. Jiang.
- I had my eye on this earlier.

68
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,912
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

69
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:51,519
Really? This one has a big nose.

70
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,080

71
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,879
Again.

72
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,840
No, you're cheating!

73
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,359
Come on, let's check out the front.

74
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,440
Why is your face so silly?

75
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
Fu was so adorable.

76
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,200
How should I know?

77
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600

78
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,760
- Thank you.
- Do come again!

79
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,279
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

80
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,159
Haven't you bought enough after all this shopping?

81
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,200
When can we go drink at Riverside Tavern?

82
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,450
No rush.

83
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,960
Though we should drink and boat
during this Shangsi Festival,

84
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,799
as gentlemen, we should appreciate
the ladies' daily efforts.

85
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,639
They'll settle down once they're satisfied.

86
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,624
Your thoughtfulness will surely
win fair ladies' hearts, Mr. Li.

87
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:40,840
Thank you.

88
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,600
Assistant Minister, it's your day off.
Shouldn't you be floating cups with scholars?

89
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,241
Wouldn't you feel out of place among us couples?

90
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,320
This looks nice.

91
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
Chuan Yu, let me hold that for you.

92
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,679
- My cousin...
- Thank you.

93
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,039
wants to pick good jade for his beloved.

94
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,799
He specifically asked me and Fu to advise him.

95
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,799
I can help choose jade! Let me assist!

96
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,440
Quiet! My cousin isn't a corrupt official.

97
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,119
Can he even afford the jade you pick?

98
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,200
Try this.

99
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Not bad. Try this one.

100
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,840
The city walls stand guard over the three Qins,
while mists veil the five crossings.

101
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,480
Though we part as fellow wanderers in officialdom,

102
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,919
true friends span seas and horizons.

103
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,600
Don't shed tears at crossroads where we part.

104
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,679
- So good.
- A fine poem.

105
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,519
Another poem, please!

106
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,359
When I earn enough from selling calligraphy,
we'll retreat to Mount Zigai outside the city.

107
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:47,720
We'll build a wooden cabin
and grow a garden of melons and fruits.

108
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,279
We'll leave all affairs of Chang'an behind us

109
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,720
and live quietly together
until our hair turns white.

110
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,519
Zi Shu... Perhaps we truly can start anew.

111
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,279
 ♫ I'll follow my heart's desire ♫

112
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,480
The villain is finally dead.
No one will harm me anymore!

113
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,160
I will pass the Spring Exam.
I will succeed in the Spring Exam!

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,359

This sacred Buddhist ground forbids self-harm.

149
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,480
My sins weigh too heavy. I don't deserve to live.

150
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,119
Your compassion shouldn't be
wasted on redeeming a sinner like me.

151
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,240
As someone burdened with karma,

152
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,040
how can you seek relief in death
without repaying your debts?

00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:07,931
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

165
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:16,657
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫

166
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:37,159
No one is confessing to me.
All this was prepared for you by Mr. Jiang.

167
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,640
 ♫ Floating dust veils the returning shadow ♫

168
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,839
Your birthday falls in springtime.

169
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,640
But Spring is brief,
and we're always plagued by troubles.

170
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,960
After all this time, we can
finally celebrate your birthday properly.

171
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,680
Now that I think of it,
our first meeting was also in Spring.

172
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,664
 ♫ Settle mountains and seas upon return ♫

173
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,880
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

174
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:27,010
 ♫ Love is boundless ♫

175
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:34,051
 ♫ Let the years migrate ♫

176
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:40,400
 ♫ Flowers bloom and fall ultimately to oneself ♫

177
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,440
Jiang Chang Yang! How dare you
pluck such expensive peonies?

178
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,720
Do you have so much money
you don't know where to spend it?

179
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,079
These aren't real flowers.
They're Guild Head Lv's thoughtful gesture.

180
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,520
Rice-paper flowers
modeled after your favorite peonies.

181
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,960
Enough. Everyone, come out now.

182
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,799
Even if Chang Yang had three heads and six arms,
he couldn't have done this so thoroughly in days.

183
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,440
Come out quickly.

184
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,679
- Let's go.
- Okay.

185
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,279
You all... really went all out.

186
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,160
And you, Xing. You don't
even blink when lying now.

187
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,600
Not everything was a lie.

188
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,240
Who did you give
that auspicious cloud jade pendant to?

189
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,559
Well done, Xing! You've won a beauty's heart.

190
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,839
I just haven't found
the right time to tell everyone.

191
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,280
Come. Let's check on the longevity noodles.

192
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,240
Okay.

193
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,000
Serve slowly. I still have unfinished business.

194
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come, Yun Niang. Come, come. Stand in the middle.

195
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:25,480
It's precisely because of your planning
that I could have a free ride.

196
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
- This...
- Fu.

197
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,640
- It's you.
- It's me.

198
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,359
Come back here! I'll... I'll beat you to death!

199
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,399
- Stop!
- Give it to me. I...

200
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,799
- It's me! It's me.
- Chun.

201
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,079
- What about that lady?
- She's skilled. Let's wait at the shop. Hurry!

202
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,400
- This way.
- My medicine.

203
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,879
Quickly! Forget the medicine. Let's go!

204
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,719
Who else is there?

205
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,799
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

206
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,919
- This is me.
- Liu Lang.

207
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,160
Man, Tao, this is us.

208
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,399
It's us.

209
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:31,528
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

210
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:39,944
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

211
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:47,944
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

212
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
Chuan Yu, it's you and me.

213
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,600
Chuan Yu's blushing!

214
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:23,459
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

215
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:31,459
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

216
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:41,160
You've stayed with me through these years,
and we've turned hardship into prosperity.

217
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,519
Thank you all for preparing
such a thoughtful birthday celebration for me.

218
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,719
I am supremely fortunate
to have met you all in this lifetime.

219
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,640
Enough about that.

220
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:11,559
Simply put, thank you for your constant support.

221
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,880
Wait. Weren't we supposed
to surprise Mu Dan today?

222
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,480
Who leaked the secret?

223
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,480
Crying like this...
Do you hate Mu Dan's painting skills?

224
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,200
She stayed up nights working
until her hands nearly fell off!

225
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,279
Mr. Jiang, you organized this celebration.
Why did you spoil your own surprise?

226
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,080
What magic did Mu Dan use
to make you confess everything?

227
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,359
 Out with it! What're you hiding from me?

228
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,480
 Nothing! What could I possibly hide?

229
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,759
 Jiang Sui Zhi, you think I don't know my cousin?

230
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,119
 Or Chun? Or You?

231
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,839
It's complicated... It's so complicated.

232
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,240
Come, everyone! Eat the noodles!

233
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,599
Come here now. No more tears.

234
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,759
It's a joyous day! Come and eat noodles!

235
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,641
Here, take this bowl. Eat up!

236
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:22,240
It smells so good.

237
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,880
Mu Dan, what do you think of my new wine?
Is it worthy of the Zuijin Tower's name?

238
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,040
It's average.

239
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,600
Just kidding!

240
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,880
With Jin Niang's wine and Liu Lang's cooking,

241
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,599
the Zuijin Tower will surely prosper!

242
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,480
- Save some for me!
- Mu Dan, I've grown up.

243
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,880
I can run my own shop. You can rest assured.

244
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
The world's kinder now.
My unfilial son has also returned.

245
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,599
He's been helping with most chores in our garden.

246
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,640
Shopkeeper, leave with peace of mind.

247
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,680
With me overseeing things,
not a single flower here will wither!

248
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,200
I see.

249
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,680
Sheng County's embroidery shop is so successful
that we're hiring women from neighboring counties!

250
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,640
Magistrate Yu is full of ambition now.

251
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,000
He vows to show you
new granaries upon your return!

252
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,559
Let him handle it confidently.

253
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,359
I do look forward to that.

254
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,000
I've found a woman
as skilled with musical instruments as I am.

255
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,559
She'll work at Fragrance Garden in my place.
You can trust her, Shopkeeper.

256
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,800
Alright, Tao. Then come with me
to see the vast skies and seas.

257
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,359
Weren't you all just fine a moment ago?
What's going on now?

258
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,559
They say "Don't worry", but they actually mean
that they will miss you a lot.

259
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,119
Exactly. We finally reunited after so long.
Why must you leave again?

260
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:52,599
Madam, flowers bloom and wither in their time.
People naturally gather and part as well.

261
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,920
Don't worry. Fu has already told me.

262
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,359
This time she won't come with me
and will stay to spend more time with you.

263
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,359
Congratulations.

264
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,960
Yes, Mother. I'm staying.

265
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,319
I know you've been deeply worried
when Mu Dan and I weren't here.

266
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,119
Chun told me your health
has declined significantly.

267
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,240
You must never do heavy labor again in the future.

268
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,960
Moreover, with Chuan...

269
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,519
Chuan Yu and I here,

270
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,999
we'll handle all the work at home and the shop.

271
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,960
You should just enjoy your retirement.

272
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,920
Alright. When will you and Chuan Yu give me
a grandchild? That'll cure all my ailments.

273
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,039
Mother! Chuan Yu...

274
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,240
Mu Dan, maybe I should still go with you.

275
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,960
I wouldn't dare.

276
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,240
Mr. Jiang, when I'm no longer
by your side in the future,

277
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,160
you must be extra careful during fights.

278
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,201
Brat, my martial arts are better than yours.

279
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,759
You first came to me as an orphan,

280
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:57,400
and you've endured dangers without stability.

281
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Now that you finally have
your own family, live your life well.

282
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,960
Mr. Jiang, you will travel the land
and be His Majesty's eyes.

283
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,599
I will remain in the capital as your eyes.

284
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,160
Official duties matter,
but personal affairs can coexist.

285
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,480
Though you work under me,
you're still Zhen Qing Yun.

286
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,519
The reopened Wuyong Hall
in Chang'an still needs me.

287
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,000
Besides, my father is aging.
I want to spend time with him.

288
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,119
With you in the capital and Sheng County,
I can focus on the southern business ventures.

289
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,200
Chun, Wuyong Hall is in your hands now.

290
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,640
Sui Zhi, go with peace.

291
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,519
I'll serve diligently in the capital
to fulfill our late Master's aspirations.

292
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,440
I won't betray the peaceful era
you fought bloodily to achieve.

293
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Mu Dan, you showed me that there is
more than one way to serve the nation.

294
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Mother used to despise merchants.

295
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,359
But now, seeing your achievements,
she's moved with shame.

296
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:09,359
To your past deeds,
and to your future journeys' safety!

297
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,800
Thank you, Xing.

298
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,720
Enough! We're just traveling south for business.
Why act like this is farewell forever?

299
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,240
Fragrance Garden remains in Chang'an.
My family is in Chang'an.

300
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,920
Sui Zhi and I will visit whenever possible.

301
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,279
Rest assured, everyone.
I'll take good care of Mu Dan.

302
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:42,399
If she loses even an ounce by our next meeting,
punish me as you wish.

303
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,000
They say fine weather, beautiful views, delightful
moods, and joyful events rarely converge.

304
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,960
Yet today, my beloved family and friends
share them all together.

305
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,839
Let's cherish this moment and sing with wine!

306
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,400
Come on, let's drink.

307
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,080
- Come on.
- Come on, have a drink.

308
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Liu Lang, I'm watching you.
You haven't finished your drink.

309
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
I'll finish this. Let's have another round.

310
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,439
The evening breeze here is the most pleasant.

311
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,319
We'll depart tomorrow.

312
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,760
You bid farewell to Consort Shu in the palace.
Has our new household registration been approved?

313
00:31:39,528 --> 00:31:43,240

314
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,159
Jiang Da Shan, are you satisfied?

315
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,279
With Consort Shu's backing,
I can no longer rely on Mr. Third.

316
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,679
Enough. Karma repays in kind. I accept it.

317
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,399
What's this?

318
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,608

319
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,480
Countless memories happened in this place.
I can't bear to simply abandon it.

320
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,759
Previously, you were tricked
by that house broker into renting this yard.

321
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:39,799
Now, Mr. Third helped me rearrange the layout
of the Jiang Mansion and separated this area.

322
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,199
This will be our home from now on.

323
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,201
I was already moved on my birthday,
yet you still prepared another surprise.

324
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,880
Though the egret lantern was my idea,

325
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,440
everyone helped with it,
and you noticed it in advance anyway.

326
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,359
So I improvised this land deed
as your birthday gift.

327
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,280
I suppose a shrewd merchant like you
won't refuse such a valuable deed.

328
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,880
Thank you, Jiang Chang Yang.

329
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,719
Such an expensive gift
only earns me one kiss from my lady?

330
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,799
I don't even know what gift
to prepare for your birthday.

331
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:30,504
By then we might be somewhere unknown,
and there may be no one to help me.

332
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:33,119
Corrupt officials are harder to handle
than shady merchants.

333
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,840
My lady, you'll need to think carefully about it.

334
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,119

335
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,119
The peonies have bloomed today. Welcome.

336
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,400
By joining the flower guild, you'll now
share both glory and hardship with us.

337
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,680
Should you encounter any difficulties,
don't hesitate to ask.

338
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,119
Chang'an Flower Guild treats all equally,
regardless of gender.

339
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,240
That's why we have this opportunity
to open our own shop.

340
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,640
- Thank you, Guild Head.
- Thank you, Guild Head.

341
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:47,079
The new rules weren't from me, but from Lady He,
His Majesty's appointed top flower merchant.

342
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,079
I've heard of Lady He.

343
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,639
Pity she was implicated by her husband.
Now her whereabouts are unknown.

344
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,280
A good person like Lady He
will surely overcome misfortune.

345
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,760
Indeed. There's no need for you two
to worry about her.

346
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,441
- Lady He...
- Thank you.

347
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:10,840
is currently selling medicine and flowers
among the people, improving lives through trade.

348
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,639
- Thank you, Shopkeeper.
- We appreciate your efforts.

349
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,400
Well done.

350
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,280
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

351
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,360
Lian Niang.

352
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,199
This is for you.

353
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:34,679

354
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,519
From now on, you're free.

355
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,280
No more living in fear
or sinking with that gambler.

356
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,840
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

357
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,559
What are you doing? Get up quickly.

358
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,400
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

359
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,240
Look, everyone, this is my inn.

360
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,119

361
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,719
Ahead, there are flower shops,
clinics, and herbal stores.

362
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,679
Lian Niang, you grew up
in a fishing village. Can you swim?

363
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,920
Yes.

364
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
Are you accustomed to boats?

365
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes, I am.

366
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,639
Perfect, I have merchant ships.
You can find work there.

367
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,360
Thank you, Shopkeeper.

368
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,559
There are many ways to earn money in this world.

369
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:32,960
I believe you can support yourselves
and improve your lives.

370
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,559
Okay.

371
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,599
Shopkeeper, you're so capable.
Doesn't your husband feel overshadowed?

372
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,800
Does he treat you well?

373
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,800
When it comes to living together,
why compete over who's better?

374
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,520
My husband treats me very well.
You'll see him soon.

375
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,960
The flower shop is just ahead.

376
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,039
This pearl powder could be ground finer.

377
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,559
Sir, do you like it?

378
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,840
Excellent, excellent.

379
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,519
- What about me?
- Not bad either.

380
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,960
Shopkeeper, is this your husband?

381
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,840
Look at this one.
It matches your complexion perfectly.

382
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,279
Jiang Da Shan.

383
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,039
My lady...

384
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,480
Come with me.

385
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,119
I'm just helping you sell incense powder.
Don't misunderstand me.

386
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,760
I don't need a clerk like you to sell them.

387
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,840
But you need a handsome clerk
with silver-tongued charm like me.

388
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,880
Take a good look! Buy more, buy more!

389
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,799
Choose more, buy more!

390
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,519
Your acting skills are getting better.

391
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,159
Those officials' wives would never guess
that I'm an undercover inspector.

392
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,960
You seemed to be
enjoying yourself outside earlier.

393
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:06,840
That was just acting. I only enjoy being with you.

394
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,920
Go away, go away. Come here.

395
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,840
I need to discuss serious matters with you.

396
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,320
After months of business in Yangzhou,
I've observed carefully

397
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,679
that the tax collection
aligns with His Majesty's new policies.

398
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,679
What useful information have you gathered?

399
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,039
Prefect Ge took his wife on an outing on the 15th
last month and stayed away for half a month.

400
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,440
On the 10th this month,
he's taking his wife hunting again.

401
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,559
This is the season
for dredging rivers and spring farming,

402
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:45,719
yet a prefect neglects duties to travel around.

403
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,719
Though His Majesty's reforms reduced corruption,

404
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,839
we can't tolerate
incompetent officials failing their duties.

405
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,239
If you've completed your undercover
investigation, you can take action.

406
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:06,839
Alright, I need to go out.
Don't wait up for me for dinner.

407
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,559
You haven't eaten with me for days.
What are you off to do today?

408
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:15,239
Master Doctor Fu is retiring to his hometown.

409
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,320
Many officials are eyeing him,
hoping to have him retire at their estates.

410
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,559
Such excellent medical skills only serving a few
would be a waste, wouldn't it?

411
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,920
So of course, such a talented person
should come to our Wuyong Hall.

412
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,039
My lady, your plans are truly impressive.

413
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,800
With Master Doctor Fu at this Wuyong Hall,

414
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,599
all Wuyong Halls across the land
will have his excellent prescriptions.

415
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,960
If Master Doctor Fu can leave
a prosperous place like Chang'an,

416
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,400
it shows he's not pursuing fame or fortune.

417
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,239
I believe he'll surely join me
in helping more people.

418
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,912
Alright. I just need to meet him before others do.

419
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:04,960
Once the contract is signed, it will vanquish
those officials' selfish intentions.

420
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,440
Let's go.

421
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,039
Ling Ge, these are Ejiao cakes
with peach blossoms I specially ordered for you.

422
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,639
You can consume some daily to nourish your health.

423
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

424
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,480
Your Majesty?

425
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,719
Bring it up.

426
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,480
Mu Dan thinks of you and sends unique gifts
from every place she visits.

427
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,320
But that heartless Sui Zhi

428
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,519

429
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:02,320
He completely ruins my mood.

430
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,639
This thin memorial must have cost
Sui Zhi considerable efforts.

431
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,440
If you miss him, why not summon him
to the capital for the New Year?

432
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,559
Here, try some.

433
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,039
Chun, your letter.

434
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:25,480
- Thank you.
- Tired?

435
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,679
Chuan Yu, look.

436
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,360
Fu, this is pear blossom wine from Mu Dan.

437
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,199
You're pregnant. You can't drink alcohol.

438
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,560
- Just one sip.
- No drinking.

439
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,320
Wuyong Hall secured Master Doctor Fu.
I'm packing to find Mu Dan now.

440
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,480
Excellent.

441
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,280
Here, this wine tastes good.

442
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,400
Mu Dan sent paintings.

443
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,880
It's Madam and Mr. Jiang.

444
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,000
So beautiful.

445
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,632
- Ice crystal peony.
- How lovely.

446
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,758
 ♫ Do not let the mortal world lock it ♫

447
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:56,926
 ♫ Why follow the arbitrary guesses
of the common eye ♫

448
00:41:56,926 --> 00:42:03,422
 ♫ Smile at the winds and rains stirring the dust ♫

449
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:08,679
As an undercover inspector, you spend days mostly
investigating mediocre and corrupt officials.

450
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:11,159
What a waste of talent.

451
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:16,320
Only under clean governance
can great talents like me be wasted like this.

452
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,760
I do also hope Wuyong Hall's business declines.

453
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,440
Fewer patients mean less suffering in the world.

454
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,480
What about your business?

455
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,880
I sell medicine to the sick,
and flowers to the healthy.

456
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
If all people

457
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,159
could avoid illness and poverty
with grain at home, flowers in the courtyard,

458
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,119
and a loved one in their hearts,
that would be the best of days.

459
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,920
Alright, I'll head to Wuyong Hall later
to check on the newly arrived herbs.

460
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,039
You can go back first.

461
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,920
My official duties are done for today.
I'll accompany you.

462
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,000
This is also my selfish desire.

463
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,679
Jiang Da Shan, you're truly such a clingy person.

464
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:01,559
You pushed down the wall. You made the choice.

465
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,760
Now, you can't back out anymore.

466
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,401
- Let's see if you can catch me!
- I'm coming!

467
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:11,400
Jiang Da Shan, you're too slow!

468
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,960
Wait for me, my lady!

469
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,560
Hurry up!

00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:29,096

471
00:43:29,096 --> 00:43:33,450

472
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:50,724
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

473
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:59,138
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

474
00:43:59,138 --> 00:44:07,330
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

475
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:15,682
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

476
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:23,879
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

477
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:32,066
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

478
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:40,482
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

479
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:48,482
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

480
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:16,634
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

481
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:24,085
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

482
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:32,071
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

483
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:40,380
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

484
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:48,642
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

485
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:56,898
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

486
00:45:56,898 --> 00:46:05,326
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

487
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:13,326
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
