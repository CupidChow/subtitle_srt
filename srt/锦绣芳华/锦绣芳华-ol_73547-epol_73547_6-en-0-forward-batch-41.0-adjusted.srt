00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,890

3
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,940

4
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,040
Miss He, quick, get out.

5
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,039
Miss He, you go first!

6
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,339
- Madam Tang, quick.
 - You go first.

7
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,700
- You go first, quickly.
 - Go.

8
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:50,539
Quick, go call someone, quick!

9
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,679
- Miss He, be careful.
 - Quick, someone come over!

10
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,439
There's a fire, quick, someone come over!

11
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,800
Someone come!

12
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,860
 Open the door!

13
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,900
 Is anyone there?

14
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,619
I'll say it one last time.

15
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:20,520
Move aside.

16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,939
 Quick, someone come!

17
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:25,099
Unless I'm dead.

18
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,540
Make them open the door, open it!

19
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,439
 Quick, someone come! Is there anyone to help?

20
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,140
 Is there anyone? Come on!

21
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,719
 Quick, someone come!

22
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,180
A'Xiang!

23
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,339
Mu Dan, quick, run!

24
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,139
Quick!

25
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,599
Xiao Chun. Gui'ze.

26
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,260
- Run!
 - Hurry up!

27
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,379
Xiao Chun, I'll leave the injured people to you.

28
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,620
- Okay.
 - Quick.

29
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,219
I'll catch you.

30
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:36,600
- Shopkeeper.
 - A'Man, come.

31
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,399
Go quickly.

32
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,619
Go quickly.

33
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,819
Is there anyone else to help?

34
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,519
Young Master Liu, hurry.

35
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,940
Quick, water, more water.

36
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,840
Coming!

37
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,960
Quickly, go.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,660
Coming.

39
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,119
Fetch water. Quick, wet yourself.

40
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,820
Bear with it.

41
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,020
Xiao Chun, where's Mu Dan?

42
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,120
- Mu Dan is still inside rescuing people.
 - Zuixiang Tower collapsed!

43
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,439
People are trapped underneath. Quickly, follow me to save them!

44
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,460
Chuan Yu, Da Fu, go rescue people quickly.

45
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,460
- Yes.
 - The oil's catching fire!

46
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,899
A'Tao!

47
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,220
Mu Dan!

48
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,200
Mu Dan!

49
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:29,219
Jiang Chang Yang!

50
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,520
Mu Dan!

51
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,239
Third Young Master.

52
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,579
Third Young Master, wake up.

53
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
Sui Zhi.

54
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,980
My sister.

55
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,500
Don't worry about me. You all should go.

56
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,480
We came together. We must leave together.

57
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,879
Sui Zhi, listen to me.

58
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,160
This fire is strange. It probably started because of the Crown Prince.

59
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,339
You're his study companion. You must ensure his safety.

60
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,659
Listen to me, get the Crown Prince out first, then come back to save me.

61
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,040
I'll wait here for you.

62
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,779
Wait for me.

63
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,420
Third Young Master.

64
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,960
Sister!

65
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,600
Jiang Chang Yang.

66
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,739
Jiang Chang Yang.

67
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:58,119
Wake up, Jiang Chang Yang.

68
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,480
Don't worry, I'm here. The fire won't reach you.

69
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,380
We'll get out together.

70
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,899
Come on,

71
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,700
A'Tao!

72
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,459
Everyone together.

73
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,199
Come, quickly, everyone together.

74
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,119
- Apply this medicine to her in a moment.
- Xiao Chun!

75
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,299
A'Tao.

76
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,600
Mu Dan.

77
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,440
- Are you okay?
 - Here, give it to me.

78
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
- Come on.
- A'Tao, wake up.

79
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,120
- Madam, how are you?
 - I'm fine.

80
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,839
How are the other places doing?

81
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,559
Zuixiang Tower burned the most seriously, as well as the greenhouse for cultivating peonies.

82
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,760
Da Fu, water.

83
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,299
Mu Dan, you just saved people and now you want the flowers?

84
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,100
No, Floral Haven relies on that room full of peonies this winter.

85
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,260
No matter how precious the peonies are, they're not more important than your life!

86
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,579
It's okay, Jiang Chang Yang, let me go.

87
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:11,939
Let me go, I'm fine on my own.

88
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,200
- Mu Dan.
 - Mu Dan.

89
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,460
- Shopkeeper.
 - Mu Dan.

90
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,839
Mu Dan, you're awake. How are you?

91
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,960
Is your head still dizzy? Is there any discomfort in your body?

92
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,179
Xiao Chun, how is everyone?

93
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,879
They're fine.

94
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,659
What about Fragrance Garden? How is it?

95
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,419
You're still injured.

96
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,740
Help me, help me down.

97
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,240
You want…

98
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
How could this happen?

99
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,000
How could this happen?

100
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,980
The Jingzhao Prefecture is already investigating. They'll surely give us an explanation.

101
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm not confident with their investigation. We must investigate ourselves.

102
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,839
The greenhouse.

103
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,020
Let's go, Xiao Chun. Quickly, check the greenhouse.

104
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,000
- Alright.
 - Mu Dan!

105
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,699
Mu Dan, quick, look!

106
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,320
Wasn't the greenhouse destroyed? How are these flowers…?

107
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,059
That night, Fragrance Garden was in chaos.

108
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,659
Everyone was rescuing the injured and trapped. They had no time for the flowers.

109
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,839
But there was one person who was as anxious as you were.

110
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,359
 Mu Dan!

111
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:12,199
 - Shopkeeper.
 - Mu Dan.

112
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,340
 Xiao Chun, help me take care of Mu Dan.

113
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,840
 Alright.

114
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:21,215
♫  If the heart were like frost, what's a lifetime of solitude?  ♫

115
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:31,097
♫  Yet you are the light, piercing through my heart  ♫

116
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:37,903
♫  If love were like frost, there would be a candle flickering in the wind  ♫

117
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:42,656
♫  Never saying a word, but always moving towards you  ♫

118
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,279
There are also flowers with severe burns.

119
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,660
Master Jiang hired a floriculturist to protect the roots in time. They were just brought back.

120
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,960
Who was it before who scolded others about wanting flowers more than life?

121
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,079
Are you alright?

122
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,079
You saved the capital for Fragrance Garden to rise again. Thank you.

123
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,579
It's…

124
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,959
MasterJiang returned to the fire many times. The smoke hurt his throat and lungs.

125
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,000
So it's better to speak less and take care of your throat.

126
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,539
You were most afraid of fire, but you risked your life to save these flowers.

127
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,620
I owe you such a big favor. How can I repay you?

128
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,500
Master Jiang means that, indeed, he's afraid of fire.

129
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,299
But he's more afraid of his beloved wife perishing in the fire,

130
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,059
afraid you would be heartbroken as your hard work was destroyed.

131
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,939
This isn't an ordinary favor, this is…

132
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,080
Quickly, go.

133
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
Let's go.

134
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:30,760
Got it, you need to put on an act in front of them.

135
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,440
Firework signal?

136
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,500
You mean when there's danger next time,

137
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,559
when the signal goes up, you'll come when you see it.

138
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,120
Don't be sad.

139
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:32,779
Don't be sad, at worst we'll start over.

140
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,440
I'll be with you.

141
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,979
I'll take it seriously then.

142
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,880
Done smashing? I can leave now?

143
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,419
Are you in a hurry to see He Wei Fang? She's not dead. Are you satisfied?

144
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,160
What's the use of smashing those things? Why not just set me on fire as well?

145
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,699
Just like Wu Ping Zhi.

146
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:43,399
Wouldn't it be more satisfying to find a new husband?

147
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,020
You know?

148
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,640
So you think I'm vicious and ruthless, and avoid me like the plague, right?

149
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,740
My last marriage was like a cage or a prison.

150
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,260
I couldn't break free, so I destroyed that cage!

151
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,399
That's why I cherish and love you so much.

152
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:21,240
I can't bear your love and affection!

153
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,539
Why must it be me?!

154
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,920
Only by loving you can I feel free.

155
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,120
All I seek for the rest of my life is you.

156
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,579
But I have to watch you thinking of He Wei Fang and missing He Wei Fang!

157
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,100
What else can I do besides kill her?!

158
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,500
What else can I do? What?

159
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,879
Li You Zhen, why do you still not understand?

160
00:17:54,879 --> 00:18:00,399
Even without He Wei Fang, I no longer have feelings for you.

161
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:12,159
But if you kill her, you're forcing me to hate you for a lifetime.

162
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,900
I don't understand. Didn't you say we'd pledge our hearts to each other, swearing never to part?

163
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,359
Why can't you keep me in your heart and try again?

164
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:28,780
When we pledged our hearts to each other, we already missed the chance.

165
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,340
Since then,

166
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,780
we've been forcing ourselves and acting out of necessity.

167
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:47,540
If we continue to torment each other, we'll just grow old together in resentment.

168
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,760
Why bother?

169
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,300
Then let us be a resentful couple growing old together.

170
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,419
I'll torment He Wei Fang, and you torment me.

171
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm telling you, I'd rather live like this for a lifetime. I won't let go.

172
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:37,340
I can try to be nicer to you,

173
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,520
to make you feel less jealous and less pain.

174
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,280
But I have one condition, do not hurt her anymore.

175
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,259
Do you feel sorry for her or pity me?

176
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,580
Think it through.

177
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,019
I promise you.

178
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,290
Don't stay at Taoguang Courtyard anymore.

179
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,480
Come home, okay?

180
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,259
Young Master Liu, it's time to eat!

181
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:22,439
Alright, let's eat first, come on.

182
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,439
- Be careful.
 - Nowadays, everything needs money to fix.

183
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:28,100
After repairing the courtyard, there's no money for the house.

184
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,119
The furniture is quite damaged and we need new ones.

185
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,380
Madam, why don't we repair the courtyard first?

186
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,219
Let's wait until spring to open Zuixiang Tower and hold a few spring banquets.

187
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:41,780
What do you think?

188
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,219
Mu Dan, you're thoughtful. Let's proceed as you suggested.

189
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,179
Why is it so plain again?

190
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,939
I'm craving flavor and want roasted mutton.

191
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,040
You want to drink too, don't you?

192
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,900
Xiao Chun said you have quite a few burn wounds on your body.

193
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,540
It's hot right now. If boils develop, it'll be difficult to handle.

194
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,740
Before scabbing, fishy-tasting foods and mutton that incites inner heat, and what else?

195
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,179
- Liquor.
 - Yes, they mustn't enter the mouth.

196
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,879
I'm really useless. I couldn't save you.

197
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,620
I can't even protect myself.

198
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,060
The garden is short of manpower now, yet I can only rest here.

199
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,739
I still have to trouble Madam Sun to bring us food.

200
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:28,580
It's nothing.

201
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,499
You used to do the cooking. Now let me try my hand.

202
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:36,180
- Exactly, Young Master Liu. Don't blame yourself.
 - Try this.

203
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,100
Your cooking skills are really getting better and better.

204
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,380
Of course, I added some crushed lotus leaves to the soup.

205
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,780
It moistens the lungs and generates fluids, perfect for patients.

206
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,040
You two should drink more bowls.

207
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,780
Master Jiang's throat endured smoke, it fits the symptoms perfectly.

208
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,900
How about we send him two bowls later?

209
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,800
Sure.

210
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,439
- Young Madam.
 - Chuan Yu.

211
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,739
His Majesty learned Master Jiang was injured and granted a lotus seed and turtle soup.

212
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,459
He thought of your injury, and asked me to bring a bowl over.

213
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,040
How can we let down Young Master's intentions?

214
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,839
I haven't tasted this soup since I made it. What's the flavor?

215
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,300
Come on, give it to me. I'll drink it.

216
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,179
How can that be? We can't let down your intentions even more.

217
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,079
I'll drink both bowls.

218
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,780
How is his injury? Is it better?

219
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,019
He can speak now.

220
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:35,140
He's thinking about your roasted meat and fine wine, saying it multiple times a day.

221
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,480
His Majesty assigned a physician, worried he'll break the diet and won't recover well.

222
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,799
Right, the grill in the pavilion and those jars of Peach Blossom wine,

223
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,660
I must take them away. Otherwise, if these two secretly meet at night,

224
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,200
- who knows when the illness will be cured?
 - Da Fu, eat first.

225
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,779
I'll help you.

226
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:56,859
Let's eat.

227
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:12,680
Young Master, the fiercest burned spots have traces of kerosene being poured.

228
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,580
It seems as you guessed.

229
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,000
Those people hid the kerosene in the wooden meal delivery boxes.

230
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,159
With such a large amount, they probably couldn't wait to burn Young Madam to ashes.

231
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,960
These burn marks are very unique.

232
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,499
Especially these cracks, only combustion explosions cause them.

233
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,300
This kerosene must have a significant origin. Continue investigating.

234
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,800
Yes, Sir.

235
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,800
Timber, ten strings.

236
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,540
In the old days, we used to roast meat and drink here together.

237
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,860
I wonder what he's doing right now.

238
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,300
He's more seriously injured, he's likely taken medicine and is resting now.

239
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:24,259
Forget it.

240
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:29,659
- Six, five.
 - Seven.

241
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,759
Alright, you lost.

242
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,879
- Again.
 - Come on.

243
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,160
- Seven.
 - Six.

244
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,900
This is strong enough.

245
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,790
Hu cakes!

246
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,580
- You didn't call me to get food.
 - I thought you were asleep.

247
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,100
What would you two like to order?

248
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,140
Our meat is plentiful and satisfying, both tender and delicious.

249
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,040
Please have a seat.

250
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,880
Let me turn your meat for you.

251
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,499
The meat needs frequent turning to be delicious. I'll do it for you.

252
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,440
I think this meat smells quite good. How about we…?

253
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,680
This meat is perfectly cooked, fatty but not greasy.

254
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,979
Be sure to eat a few more pieces.

255
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,939
This wine is mellow and fragrant, with a long-lasting aftertaste.

256
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,979
Let me drink this cup to the fullest.

257
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:45,499
Luckily, we ran into each other. Otherwise, we wouldn't have resisted.

258
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,580
Having someone to share the longing makes it bearable.

259
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,779
Indeed, today's restraint is for better days of eating meat and drinking wine in the future.

260
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,800
The smell of the roasted meat was just too strong.

261
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,300
If I go back now, Da Fu will definitely think I went to sneak a bite.

262
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,060
I'll fan you to get rid of the smell.

263
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Then fan more.

264
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,100
Jiang Chang Yang, most people love a full moon.

265
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,459
But I find the crescent moon more captivating than the full moon, do you know why?

266
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,059
Why?

267
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,140
Because the crescent moon is curved and bright, it looks much like something.

268
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,019
What does it look like?

269
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,739
It looks like the eyes of someone who loves to laugh.

270
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,900
Turn around, I'll fan you from behind.

271
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,879
Don't hit me.

272
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,060
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

273
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,680
Is this going to work or not?

274
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,900
You'll know once you try it.

275
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:30,880

276
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,380
Sachet, come and take a look!

277
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:43,960
Twenty pots of roses for this jade ornament.

278
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,240
Sir, this would make us lose too much.

279
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,300
Usually, we sell these flowers, one pot for one string in the shop.

280
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,760
How about you throw in a set of white jade cups for us?

281
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,839
Well…

282
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,620
If it's too difficult, just forget it.

283
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,320
Alright. I'll wrap it up for you.

284
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,040
Thanks for your effort.

285
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,620
This saves quite a bit of expenses.

286
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:20,400
Da Fu, give this to me, right.

287
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,839
Floral and avian against aquatic and insect life, this two look like a pair.

288
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,359
Is it for... Young Master Jiang?

289
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,340
- What do you think?
 - It's good.

290
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,919
The gifts the Floral Envoy usually receives are all translucent and flawless jade.

291
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,699
He probably wouldn't think much of ordinary white jade.

292
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:49,499
They say love for a house extends to all within, he wouldn't care if it's translucent.

293
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,140
What matters is the intention.

294
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:54,599
You're right.

295
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:59,879
But usually, I've never given him any proper items.

296
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:03,720
Would suddenly giving this be a bit odd?

297
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,720
Why? You're always decisive in business matters.

298
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,219
Going back and forth today, hesitating, that's what's strange.

299
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:15,720
Master Jiang saved people and flowers and he's your husband.

300
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,659
Giving a hairpin is very appropriate.

301
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,860
But in a bit, I have to go see the carpenter repairing the garden.

302
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,040
Da Fu, help me give this hairpin to him.

303
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,740
Okay.

304
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,300
Master Jiang would be delighted upon receiving this, right?

305
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,040
Sister Da Fu!

306
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,680
Madam Sun accidentally sprained her ankle. You should go look.

307
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,939
Sprained her ankle? Is it serious? Did they invite a physician?

308
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,879
Xiao Chun has already seen her, but I'm not quite sure what the specific injury is.

309
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:54,240
Sister Da Fu, go on. I'll deliver the hairpin for you.

310
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,860
- Okay.
 - Let's go.

311
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,900
By the way, Young Master Liu, when you deliver it,make sure to tell him,

312
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,150
that Mu Dan selected this carefully. Don't let her down.

313
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,580
Rest assured, I'll definitely convey it.

314
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,419
- Thank you. Let's go.
 - Let's go.

315
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:06,919
Over here.

316
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,620
With Mu Dan's stingy nature, she's giving me something?

317
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,560
Mu Dan is grateful for your kindness in saving the flowers. This is a thank you gift.

318
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:39,140
There are some words she can't say plainly, so she has to express it through objects.

319
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,660
Your thoughts are clear, so you'll surely understand.

320
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,719
I understand.

321
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:23,499
 A hairpin is an object signifying commitment. Breaking it signifies ending it.

322
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:29,919
 Did she sense my affection and intends to remind me to end this thought?

323
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,100
The government hasn't found the arsonist yet.

324
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,739
They even shirk responsibility, saying it was our own carelessness that caused the fire.

325
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:45,419
We can all see those black oil stains left on the ruins.

326
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,900
Are Official Ren's eyes blind?

327
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,384
We definitely can't rely on the government and can only suffer silently for now.

328
00:33:55,464 --> 00:34:01,079
Madam, take the old putty you scraped off earlier and ask the oil merchant we know.

329
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,499
We must find out where this oil came from.

330
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,099
Alright.

331
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,019
Most of the flowers Master Jiang saved are still growing well.

332
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:25,860
Only these haven't encountered the big fire. I'll find someone to handle them.

333
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,019
Madam, come. Gardener Hu, come quickly.

334
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:45,419
Look, it's sprouting.

335
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,019
- That's amazing.
 - It truly is.

336
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,380
The soil of this flower is completely burned, and the branches look withered.

337
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,419
I thought it was dead.

338
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:58,439
I tried so many times before to cultivate this new species, but couldn't keep it alive.

339
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:02,539
I didn't expect that after such a burning by fire, the moisture would dissipate,

340
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:06,879
and the spring fertilizer would mature. Now it suited the nature of this flower.

341
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,120
Withered branches, charred bones, and crimson petals.

342
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,339
How about calling it Burnt Bone Red Jade?

343
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:20,079
- Good. Sounds nice.
 - Good. A good name.

344
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,839
Our Fragrance Garden is truly blessed. Surviving a great disaster and being reborn.

345
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,739
That's great.

346
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,019
Would you like to add some more tea?

347
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,920
No, thanks.

348
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,720
- Mu Dan.
 - Xue Xi.

349
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,739
I was just about to ask for your help, and you've come.

350
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,579
Come on, sit down quickly.

351
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,359
How has your recovery been?

352
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,519
I'm pretty much recovered. What do you need, Xue Xi?

353
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,900
My birthday is approaching, and I want to celebrate it in the residence.

354
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,419
Could I ask you to organize a banquet for me?

355
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:04,839
Fragrance Garden caught fire, and needs funds and resources for repairs.

356
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:09,959
Fortunately, we've a generous client like her to take care of business, it's a double win.

357
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,919
Thank you for your kindness, Xue Xi. I'll certainly do my best.

358
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,099
What is this flower that you brought? Is it dead?

359
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:24,099
It's not dead. You saved this flower.

360
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,459
New sprouts have grown from the scorched earth.

361
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:32,560
I named it Burnt Bone Red Jade, it can bloom in the coming year.

362
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,579
The flowers will proudly stand on the branches, as crimson as the sun.

363
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,359
If I'm still here next spring, I'll be able to see this scene.

364
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,000
I came this time to thank you again.

365
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,380
Also, did you receive my gift?

366
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,280
It's not that I didn't hesitate. I thought for a long time before finally choosing it.

367
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,539
Do you... understand?

368
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,920
Of course, I understand.

369
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,779
There's been a lot of work from His Majesty. I'm afraid I'll only be back after curfew.

370
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:40,300
With the busy repairs at the Fragrance Garden, you don't need to worry about me.

371
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:46,200
Let's manage our own matters. If we can sometimes drink together, that'll be nice.

372
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,780
Okay.

373
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:10,680
Mu Dan, I already know that your marriage is fake,

374
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,600
so there's no need to put on an act with me.

375
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,380
I don't want you two to feel uncomfortable because of me.

376
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,780
Xue Xi's keen perception caught on, so I didn't hide it any longer.

377
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,839
I trust her character.

378
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:35,959
Rest assured, I'll keep your secret safe.

379
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,819
Thank you, Xue Xi.

380
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:45,660
So what kind of mystery are you two playing at?

381
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,479
If you have something to say, just say it directly to Sui Zhi.

382
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,200
What I wanted to say has already been made clear.

383
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,779
Master Jiang is wise and will surely understand what I mean.

384
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,012
I've got things to do in my garden. You two chat, I'll head back now.

385
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:12,200
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

386
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:16,807
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

387
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:21,135
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

388
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:25,024
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

389
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:30,164
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

390
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,380
I went to inquire. Master Jiang is wearing an old hairpin given Lady Xiao gave him.

391
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,740
He wore it for a long time and hasn't had the chance to replace it.

392
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,760
Don't overthink it. Let him change it when he comes back.

393
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,120
Come on, have some water.

394
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,320
 I misunderstood. I shouldn't have rashly given him the hairpin.

395
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,700
Miss Xiao is an outsider, after all.

396
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,300
Have the banquet here is one thing, but Master Jiang asked you to organize it too.

397
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,619
How could they?

398
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,860
It's not him, it's Xue Xi.

399
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,820
Xue Xi did it to support our business.

400
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,660
For a single banquet, she gave us 500 strings.

401
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,059
This money is enough to renovate all of Fragrance Garden.

402
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:35,879
We must put our heart into it and not let down their goodwill.

403
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,640
Da Fu, you can't paste it like this.

404
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,080
You need to paste each piece of flower neatly, so it looks like a carpet.

405
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,700
Look, don't leave too many gaps.

406
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,459
These crape myrtle flowers were expensively shipped from Jiangnan.

407
00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:03,019
They could live a few days more in a vase. It's a pity to cover the ground with them.

408
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,120
Are all nobles this extravagant?

409
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,499
You can't say that.

410
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:09,560
Since we've taken their money and accepted the order,

411
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,340
we should do it well according to their requirements.

412
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,539
How can we complain about the client just because of our own reluctance?

413
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,439
Sister, take a break. I brought some tea over.

414
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:22,959
- Come on, let's take a break.
 - Alright.

415
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,499
Do you want to have some water?

416
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:30,300
- Thank you, Shopkeeper, it's not necessary.
 - Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,840
Let's go.

418
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,760
Thank you, Young Master Liu.

419
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:46,019
I found out from A'Hui, no wonder so many flowers are needed.

420
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:51,680
This setup is because Miss Xiao wants to confess her feelings to Master Jiang.

421
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,939
She may express it herself, but Master Jiang might not accept it.

422
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:04,380
Excuse me, is that the dilapidated house beside the garden?

423
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,099
What dilapidated house? That's our residence.

424
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,699
What's the matter?

425
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:17,800
Are you both from the Imperial Workshop? Is Jiang Residence going to be renovated?

426
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Indeed, Miss Xiao likes pavilions and towers.

427
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,579
The Royal Princess sent us to inspect here.

428
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:25,440
She said to demolish two dilapidated houses by the garden, dig a channel for water,

429
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,800
and build a water pavilion for Miss Xiao to enjoy.
