00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,150

3
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,940

4
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,784

5
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,079
 If you don't agree to the marriage, you won't get the zixi pills.

6
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,740
 As long as mother can recover, I'm willing to do anything.

7
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,800
Bow before the mirror.

8
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Husband and wife are united, forever blessed and prosperous.

9
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,040
Forced to accept you, a merchant's daughter, is my life's greatest humiliation!

10
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,040
Today, you need to go to Fuyun Temple to pray.

11
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,920
If you are not sincere, the prayers will be ineffective./i&gt;

12
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,600
 Young Madam, remember to kneel for 10 hours. Do not rise until the hour of You arrives.

13
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,659
 How bold! How dare you try to deceive me in the Grand Celestial Master Hall.

14
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,919
 Greetings, Floral Envoy.

15
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,679
Greetings, everyone.

16
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,784
 Do not try to get the tribute medicine again.

17
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:34,360
We must not let Madam He discover that what we gave back then was a fake.

18
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,760
 If I had discovered earlier that the zixi pills were fake,

19
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,219
 Motherâ€¦ Mother might have been saved.

20
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,499
Miss, go to the shop, I'll hold them off here!

21
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,439
- Move!
 - Miss!

22
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,140
- Someone has fallen into the water!
 - Save her!

23
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,840
Yu Lu.

24
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,460
Let's go home.

25
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,160
Let's go home.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,320
 I never had my heart set on Liu Chang.

27
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,080
 If you wish to do this, you must act swiftly and decisively.

28
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,790
 Please bear witness for me

29
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,420
and approve my divorce.

30
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,519
Parting ways brings relief to both sides.

31
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,439
It's also quite a good story.

32
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:26,540
The matter is settled. Court is adjourned.

33
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:34,280
 Your Highness, I have never been your enemy. This is a win-win solution.

34
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,539
 I'm just a woman who wants to hold her fate in her own hands.

35
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,160
 But she was too greedy, insisting on taking her dowry with her.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,059
 And stirred up a lawsuit, ruining the reputation of my Liu family.

37
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,400
 We can't let her live.

38
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,560
 Mu Dan's escape at night is indeed disgraceful.

39
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,539
 I will definitely establish myself in Chang'an.

40
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,059
 I will reclaim Fragrance Garden on my own.

41
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,299
Stop! He Wei Fang!

42
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,039
- Floral Envoy?
 - Don't you want your household register anymore?

43
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,659
The authorities are indeed run by you.

44
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:19,400
Envoy Jiang, this ability, this speed. I really admire you.

45
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,384
Jiang Xiao Hua, are you satisfied?

46
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:24,859

47
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:28,110
Yes, yes.

48
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:31,979
They're all genuine peonies. Every single plant blooms splendidly.

49
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,900
- Those wishing to order, register here. Orders delivered in three days.
- I'll buy one.

50
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,712
Okay. Custom-made, tailored fragrances.

51
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:43,679
You can make your own fragrance.

52
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:44,979
Take your hand basket.

53
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:51,940
 We weren't born on the same day, but seek to get rich on the same day.

54
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,679
My house isn't next to the Jiang Residence's backyard.

55
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,840
My house is the Jiang Residence's backyard?

56
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,199
I invested money for you to do business, yet haven't earned any profit.

57
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,940
And you changed homes first?

58
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,676
Floral Haven, grand opening!

59
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:21,160

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,556
 Tranquil Health Clinic incorporates medicine into products to enhance beauty.

61
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:28,040
Whatever you need, we have it all.

62
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:35,260
Jiang Chang Yang, when you're with the children, you really don't seem like a corrupt official.

63
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,720
Then tell me, what kind of man do you fancy?

64
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,679
I hope this person can understand me better than I understand myself.

65
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:56,759
Even if I say nothing, he knows all my likes, dislikes, decisions, and dreams.

66
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,319
 No matter what situation I fall into, he can face it with me.

67
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,439
In the countless nights in our lives, only the bright moon remains by our side.

68
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,400
Today, I lend it to you.

69
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,920
 No matter where you are,

70
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,219
 as long as you see it, you'll no longer be alone.

71
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,119
You should wipe the honey off your lips first.

72
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,500
- Jingzhao Prefecture disregards the law!
 - Six.

73
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,439
Murdering for money!

74
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,319
When did Floral Haven become yours, where's Mu Dan?

75
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,580
Mu Dan treated you so well, why did you betray her?!

76
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,920
I didn't!

77
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:54,319
Despite breaking the sworn oath, I must sever my ties with you.

78
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,759
From now on, you and I are no longer related.

79
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,110
Sheng Yi, if you aren't doing well,

80
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,210
come back.

81
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,940
 May all those you meet be loyal friends.

82
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,460
 Never someone like me again.

83
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,659
Sheng Yi!

84
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,460
- Sheng Yi!
 - Sheng Yi!

85
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Sheng Yi!

86
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,580
 Mother, Yu Lu, do you see this?

87
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,380
- Make way!
 - Make way!

88
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,559
I've heard Floral Haven's cosmetic items are highly praised.

89
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,220
 Princess Ji An invites you to bring these items

90
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,200
 and go to Xingqing Palace immediately for the nobles to try.

91
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:57,319
 She's just a slave, yet you use every means to defend her,

92
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,480
ignoring our past friendship?

93
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,580
What the Princess wants is Zi Shu's affection.

94
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,720
If I marry He Wei Fang, it'll cut off Zi Shu's thoughts of her.

95
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,500
It helps your daughter solve a problem.

96
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,070
The Deputy Transport Officer position's vacant, His Majesty asked me to recommend talents.

97
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,239
I thought to ask Your Highness to help me pick some.

98
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:23,199
If this happy event is gone, I'm afraid the reward will be gone too.

99
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,719
You Zhen was harmed by your former love, fearing she may never bear children again.

100
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:34,459
Your Highness wants me to marry into your family?

101
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:47,079
 If you don't despise my cripple body, I'm willing to marry into Prince Ning Residence.

102
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,699
You and I will be together forever.

103
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,679
 I felt close to Mu Dan once I saw her at the Liu Residence in Luoyang.

104
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,100
 Over time, I developed affection for her.

105
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,040
 Grilling wine in the pavilion, drinking joyfully every night.

106
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,408
 This affection was not born overnight, but developed over time.

107
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,900
 Throughout the four seasons, the garden heralds a new year.

108
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,939
 Fragrance Garden opens today!

109
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,260
Da Fu, yours.

110
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,079
So much!

111
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,179
- She's got os much.
 - Madam Sun, yours.

112
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:36,159
- Thank you.
 - Where's mine?

113
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,860
This is Madam Tang's.

114
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,419
- A'Man's.
 - Thank you.

115
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,720
You all have yours.

116
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,819
So heavy.

117
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,439
How much did you get?

118
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,239
More than you.

119
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,859
Everyone, since Fragrance Garden opened, our business has been prosperous.

120
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,319
Thank you for your hard work!

121
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,419
Today, just enjoy the food and wine.

122
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,220
 Cheers and thank you!

123
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,519
One more, please.

124
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,100
Sister, drinking is harmful to your health.

125
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,280
You've been busy all day long. Better have this pot of calming tea I made.

126
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,319
Your sister loves to drink.

127
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:19,120
Today is joyful. A few cups won't hurt.

128
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,820
Come on. Eat up. It smells so good.

129
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,939
Try it.

130
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,259
These are the pastries you made, right? I'll give it a try.

131
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,000
Look, the shopkeeper has prepared so much food for us.

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,770
Your skills have indeed improved.

133
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,436
Young Master Liu, make some more for everyone to try.

134
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,520
- All right.
 - Go on.

135
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,880
You are getting better at coaxing kids. Master Wu taught you a lot.

136
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,860
I wasn't coaxing him.

137
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,320
His skills have gotten better and better.

138
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,540
I want to invite a pastry cook from Shangao Pastry Shop to give us some advice,

139
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,760
so we can make a set of flower-themed pastries to sell at Fragrance Garden.

140
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,719
Then, I have to try them to see if they're as you say.

141
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:09,160
Save some for others. You eat later.

142
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,180
It'll take some time to make...

143
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,410
Husband, have a piece.

144
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,299
Indeed, it's good.

145
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,740
Everyone, enjoy. Drink up.

146
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,639
Come with me.

147
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,439
I'll try some too.

148
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,640
I have things to discuss with everyone later.

149
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,140
I might have to stay overnight.

150
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,180
Why don't you leave first?

151
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,860
Everyone is watching. I can't leave before you.

152
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,520
With you here, they feel constrained.

153
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,719
Just go. I'll explain for you.

154
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,679
Then, I'll leave first.

155
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,959
Madam, don't drink too much,

156
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,179
it's bad for your health, and I'll worry.

157
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,679
Got it, just go.

158
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,240
- I'm leaving.
 - Go on.

159
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,040
I'm really leaving.

160
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,879
- Are you still eating?
 - So tasty.

161
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,479
I had some. Give it to them.

162
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:36,419
Everyone, let's make another toast!

163
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,159
 All right, another toast!

164
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,340
- Here.
 - Another toast.

165
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,719
- Drink up and enjoy!
 - All right, enjoy.

166
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,140
You kept us behind. Is there something you need us to do?

167
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,900
Jin Niang, this is yours.

168
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,880
Here, Gui'ze.

169
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,479
A'Tao, this is yours.

170
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:08,800

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,199
In these months, I've seen all of you dedicating yourselves to Fragrance Garden.

172
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,620
A few days ago, I went to the authorities and arranged your release from servitude.

173
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,640
You've been so kind to us. How can we repay your kindness?

174
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing? Get up, get up.

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,579
We're all one family. Don't talk about repayment.

176
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,640
These are your indentures.

177
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,040
The past was bitter, but the future will be better.

178
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,819
From now on, you're no longer servants, but free people.

179
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,120
Madam, we found the missing white jade pearl hairpin in her room.

180
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,819
Now that we caught her red-handed, how do you plan to deal with her?

181
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,640
I moved to Fragrance Garden long ago. That house has always been empty.

182
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,099
What hairpin? I've never seen it before.

183
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,359
If you didn't steal it, did Mu Dan steal it and hide it with you?

184
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,880
Nonsense.

185
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,920
Anyway, if it wasn't you, it was her, or you two conspired it.

186
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,000
Go call Master Jiang. Let him see what kind of person he keeps by his side.

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Yes.

188
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,120
I was told to marry Young Master Jiang by His Highness.

189
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Now that I caught you stealing, I should deal with it for His Highness.

190
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,199
You framed me. Young Master Jiang won't believe you.

191
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,439
You, a thief, how dare you to slander me!

192
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:12,180
Slap her mouth a hundred times as punishment.

193
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,980
 - Yes.
 - I didn't do it.

194
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,439
Let go of me! Let go!

195
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:20,940
Don't touch me. Let me go.

196
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,280
I act with integrity. Come at me directly!

197
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,439
If you dare to frame Mu Dan rashly, it won't just be me bleeding in this room!

198
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,859
 Young Master, you must take a good look.

199
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,920
Youâ€¦

200
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,070
Wait...

201
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,559
Young Master Jiang, you're finally here. Mu Dan's people stole my jewelry.

202
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,640
I was merely asking a few questions and she even attacked me.

203
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,559
It hurts, I'm so scared.

204
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,100
I didn't! You're just making things up!

205
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,040
- Da Fu, Da Fu!
 - It was you...

206
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,280
That's it. Young Master Jiang, you don't believe Lian Zhou, do you?

207
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,180
Lian Zhouâ€¦

208
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
Of course not.

209
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,779
It's my fault you're caught in such a situation, I'mâ€¦

210
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,759
It's nothing, just a wound.

211
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,240
Sit down first.

212
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,440
I'm fine, as long as you believe in Mu Dan.

213
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,340
- If you don't believe meâ€¦
 - Sit down.

214
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,239
Can you take care of yourself first?

215
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,280
Your body was inherited from your parents.

216
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,140
If your mother knew about this, she would be heartbroken.

217
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,820
Right. I need to stay here until I'm better.

218
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,719
Be nicer.

219
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,359
Chuan Yu, you're so good to Da Fu, more attentive than to your master.

220
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,240
I've hurt my back, but you didn't care at all.

221
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
Naturally, the one who caused your back injury should care.

222
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,800
- Da Fu, Da Fu!
 - Mu Dan.

223
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,520
- Da Fu, let me see where you're hurt.
 - Here.

224
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Has the physician been here? Will it leave a scar?

225
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,180
It's all right, I don't care about it at all.

226
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,119
Master Jiang had it checked and gave me imperial medicine. Don't worry.

227
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,300
With such an injury, how can you still smile?

228
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,480
Just a little.

229
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,060
Dou Jin told you everything before you arrived, right?

230
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,800
Don't worry, Chuan Yu applied medicine for me.

231
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,100
Go check on Young Master Jiang's back injury.

232
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,119
Your back was hurt by Lian Zhou?

233
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,559
No, it has nothing to do with today.

234
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,900
Chuan Yu, please take good care of Da Fu for me.

235
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,440
Husband, come with me.

236
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:38,159
I have something to tell you.

237
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,760
Well, Lian Zhou is here because of me.

238
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,079
I'm sorry for that. So, I'm willing to cooperate with you in this act.

239
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,720
But this has nothing to do with Da Fu.

240
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,480
Since Lian Zhou treated Da Fu this way, slandering her and punishing her.

241
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I must seek justice for Da Fu.

242
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,930
- If you want to stop meâ€¦
 - Why would I?

243
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,059
Tell me whatever you need me to do.

244
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,600
No need for that.

245
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,770
Thank you.

246
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,440
You injured your back when you carried me back that night?

247
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,159
You remember that night?

248
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,359
I was drunk, not dead. Of course, I remember.

249
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,259
I just drank a bit too much, and only remember a little.

250
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,639
A little is enough. Then, you'll pay the cost of treating the back injury.

251
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:53,079
Did they really fight?

252
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,839
The door was closed, and there was no sound.

253
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,160
But I saw He Wei Fang return to her courtyard with a stern face.

254
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,859
Once she left, Young Master sent someone to inform us

255
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:04,960
that he'll rest in your room tonight.

256
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
I knew it. Men are never single-minded.

257
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,240
It seems Jiang Residence will be exclusively for you now.

258
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,100
Add more petals to the water, then light all the incense in the room.

259
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,800
Yes.

260
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,480
Quack physician, can't even cure a few rashes!

261
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,800
Madam, these rashes developed strangely.

262
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,380
I heard that He Wei Fang understands some pharmacology. Maybe she's behind this.

263
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,979
Madam, when Young Master comes, you must ask him to stand up for you.

264
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,259
What time is it?

265
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,119
The hour of Xu*.
  (*7:00 p.m - 9:00 p.m.)

266
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:58,319
If Young Master Jiang sees me like this now, how can I win his favor?

267
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,240
Go tell him, I was very happy to hear he was coming,

268
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,319
but I caught a chill while bathing,

269
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,240
and I'm afraid of infecting him, so please don't visit.

270
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Once I recover, I'll go apologize to him.

271
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,940
Yes.

272
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,119
Madam, do you really want to do this?

273
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,879
I've consulted several physicians, they all said they can't cure it.

274
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,559
What else can I do but plead with her?

275
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,399
What a humiliation.

276
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,760
Haven't I endured enough humiliation already?

277
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,319
What's the harm in enduring it once more?

278
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,440
As long as I can recover my face,

279
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,710
there will be plenty of time to deal with her.

280
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,559
 Sister Mu Dan, could you please meet me?

281
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,319
 Sister Mu Dan?

282
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,340
Madam Lian Zhou, what's the matter?

283
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,399
After bathing with flowers last night, I was covered in itchy rashes.

284
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:22,960
I know you understand pharmacology. Could you please help me out?

285
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,719
Unfortunately, I heard that Da Fu stole your jewelry, and it's currently under investigation.

286
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:32,200
Without any leads, I donâ€™t have time to deal with it.

287
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,560
 I... I've made a mistake.

288
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,200
 Miss Zhu Fu didn't steal anything.

289
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,319
In that case, you falsely accused Da Fu.

290
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:51,319
How will you compensate for the injury to Da Fu's neck and the wrongs suffered?

291
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,040
 I'll explain to the servants and restore Miss Zhu Fu's innocence.

292
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,680
That's what you should do. How is that compensation?

293
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,140
Slander deserves a hundred slaps. This is what you said, right?

294
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,900
Then, please count them, Mu Dan, Miss Zhu Fu.

295
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,480
What trick did you use to make her admit her mistake?

296
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,240
Xiao Chun previously extracted a lot of flower juice for the beauty pills.

297
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,680
She discovered that mixing several types of flower juices can cause rashes.

298
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,479
Though there's no danger to life,

299
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:48,680
it can damage one's appearance and cause unbearable itching.

300
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,319
So, I took some and put it in her bathtub.

301
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,599
You framed her for theft, now you deserve what you did.

302
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:11,680
You need to write a statement of apology and put it in the hall to apologize to Zhu Fu.

303
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:20,680
Okay, I'll write it later. Sister, can you give me the antidote recipe?

304
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:24,119
I don't know your past,

305
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:29,500
but I can tell you didn't want to marry into this family.

306
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,079
You must have your grievances and helplessness,

307
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,559
so want to secure something at the Jiang Residence to rely on.

308
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,880
It's reasonable and I can understand it.

309
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm focused solely on business and don't want to fight for anything with you.

310
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If you no longer harm my close friends and family,

311
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,800
we can still live in peace as we did before.

312
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,120
Focused solely on business?

313
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,250
Don't you care about Young Master Jiang's affections?

314
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,280
Sui Zhi and I are mutually in love, so I don't need to fight for anything.

315
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,960
Instead of wasting time here, you should treat yourself better.

316
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,560
You!

317
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,939
Don't get upset over a man who doesn't care about you.

318
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:27,280
The madder you get, the harder it'll be for the rashes to subside.

319
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,140
Temper justice with mercy. You're truly something.

320
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:40,300
The world is harsh for us women, why employ tricks to harm each other?

321
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,270
You're the adopted daughter of Prince Ning.

322
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,639
Besides your beauty, you must have other remarkable qualities.

323
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:54,528
Is there nothing else you want to do besides pleasing your husband?

324
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:05,680
I have many exceptionally talented women here. They've long escaped the inner chambers.

325
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:13,519
Now, they're all enjoying their lives embroidering, gardening, crafting, and dressing up.

326
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,420
If you're interested in gardening, you can come visit my garden.

327
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:26,280
You want me to grow flowers and do business with you?

328
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,680
Anything wrong with that?

329
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,079
You're so strange, married to Floral Envoy,

330
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,780
yet still working hard to earn small amounts of money.

331
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:43,060
I truly don't understand why Young Master Jiang's so devoted to you.

332
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:48,559
What's wrong with earning money? Who would refuse money?

333
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,960
Besides, he likes me for having such abilities.

334
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,140
Don't be arrogant.

335
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,060
Apply it three times a day, and you'll be cured in seven days.

336
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,399
Think about what I've told you today.

337
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,559
If you figure it out, you can come to me anytime.

338
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,860
 I truly don't understand why Young Master Jiang's so devoted to you.

339
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:44,260
 We acted so well that Lian Zhou would say that.

340
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,520
 Dusk.

341
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,580

342
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,680
Oh, no.

343
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,940
Brother Jiang, I toast to you.

344
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,680
They all say the newly appointed Deputy Transport Officer is strict and fair.

345
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,559
Brother Qi, you should drink less.

346
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:27,000
If you come to work with the smell of alcohol tomorrow, I'm afraid you'll get scolded.

347
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,399
I didn't have much work before.

348
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,439
Since Liu Chang came, he's been strict and fair, showing no mercy at all.

349
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:39,440
We're so busy that we can't even take a break.

350
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,319
Liu Chang is just Prince Ning's live in son-in-law,

351
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:46,959
and a pedantic scholar from a humble background.

352
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,839
What can he achieve?

353
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,919
He really has high ambitions.

354
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,359
Repairing docks and consolidating fleets.

355
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,280
I think he won't stop until he shows Prince Ning some achievements.

356
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,319
Brother Zi Shu is working so hard, is he aiming for promotion orâ€¦

357
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:10,119
Who doesn't want a promotion? But benefits must still be secured.

358
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:16,960
Otherwise, Liu Chang's meager salary cannot support the noble Princess.

359
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,919
Despite complaining, you still diligently follow Zi Shu's lead.

360
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,000
Brother Qi, the jade pendant you're wearing today is probably worth a year's salary.

361
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:31,409
It's better to share the joy than enjoy alone.

362
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,839
With such a lucrative opportunity,

363
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,599
Brother Qi, why don't you come to my residence tomorrow and tell me?

364
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,780
My pleasure!

365
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:51,499
I think the jade on Young Master's waist looks even better.

366
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,240
A precious jade matches a beauty well.

367
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,960
Thank you, Young Master.

368
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,659
Wait, Young Master Jiang. You promised to give me a bracelet.

369
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,159
You mustn't be biased.

370
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,810
It's late, just drinking isn't fun.

371
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,410
How about blowing out a few candles?

372
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:34,200
What's the hurry on such a long night? We haven't even finished enjoying the wine.

373
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,860
Even if it's just a social, he doesn't have to hold women like this.

374
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,879
With what Lian Zhou thinks, she surely hasn't seen Jiang Chang Yang this way.

375
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,580
I knew it. I almost got confused by Lian Zhou.

376
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,879
Jiang Sui Zhi, it's so late. Why haven't you gone home?

377
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:15,340
If you want to drink, I can accompany you.

378
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,240
You're busy with business, yet you surprisingly had time to pick me up today.

379
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,739
Then, of course, I should drink with you.

380
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:30,919
Brother Qi, pay attention to the business we discussed.

381
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,480
My beloved is picking me up, so I'm leaving.

382
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,539
Brother Sui Zhi, youâ€¦

383
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:41,720
Recently, Floral Haven released new sachets. Try it.

384
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,760
The rouge scent from Huanyun Tower is too strong.

385
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,600
With these, you can avoid interrogation from wives and concubines at home.

386
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,220
Right?

387
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Farewell.

388
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,240
What's going on?

389
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,080
You said you'd rescue me at first quarter of Xu Hour, but you arrived at the third.

390
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,440
If you were any later, the candles in the room would've been blown out.

391
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:21,809
I got frightened by Lian Zhou.

392
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,840
We acted too well. Lian Zhou truly thinks you've fallen for me.

393
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,319
She even... told me a bunch of strange words.

394
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,440
She should really see your flirtatious behavior today.

395
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,739
Just take what she said as a joke. You didn't take it seriously, did you?

396
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:49,920
Of course, I didn't.

397
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,319
Lian Zhou only sees how good you treat me.

398
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,340
She doesn't know that it's because we have a life-and-death friendship.

399
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,559
But, understandably, outsiders wouldn't understand

400
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,499
why a high-ranking official treat a small merchant so well?

401
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,240
Over the years,

402
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,800
I've seen a lot of intrigues in officialdom and the pretenses between people.

403
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,680
Someone as honest and open-minded as you is rare.

404
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,280
Of course, I would treat you sincerely.

405
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,019
Are you drunk? Why are you suddenly praising me?

406
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:40,620
Making me feel quite embarrassed.

407
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,559
You're this type of person, so you deserves others' kindness.

408
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,419
Moreover, you also treat me well.

409
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,750
You said before,

410
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,690
it's hard to find a soulmate. There's no need to always express gratitude.

411
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,920
It makes us seem distant.

412
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,979
You treat me sincerely, I'll never let you down as a soulmate.

413
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:09,319
From now on, in my heart, besides Da Fu and Xiao Chun,

414
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,560
you're my most important person.

415
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,639
If you need help, just tell me.

416
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Jiang Xiao Hua, we're soulmates, and I only rank third in your heart?

417
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,959
Naturally, besties are more important.

418
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,390
Here.

419
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,219
- Take the prescription to get the medicine.
 - Thank you.

420
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,760
Have all the gifts from clients been returned?

421
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,080
Madam Luo, who came before, embroidered this handkerchief to show her gratitude.

422
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,080
This isn't any precious item, and with your name,

423
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,459
so I decided to keep it.

424
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,160
Her eye condition just improved. She shouldn't do such taxing things.

425
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,639
When she comes next, I'll give her a good talking to.

426
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,039
Please call the next person.

427
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,639
Yes.

428
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:37,539
Father.

429
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,839
Young Master Liu, remember.

430
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,319
Spring is not yet full, and crops are already growing. That's Qin.

431
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,459
I taught your sister like this, too.

432
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,270

433
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,900
Right.

434
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,910
Young Master Liu, you're holding the brush wrong again.

435
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,280
Look, hold the brush like this,

436
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,519
only then will the strokes you write be proper.

437
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,519
See? Here, try again.

438
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,760
Yes.

439
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Combine these two. Move this back.

440
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,719
Okay, try it now.

441
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,360
Find the feeling.

442
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,390
Not bad. Right.

443
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,960
Go further down.

444
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,500
Mu Dan.

445
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,860
Why are you here at this hour?

446
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,760
- Continue.
 - You helped Consort Shu recuperate for a while, and she's improved a lot.

447
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,080
Before returning to the palace, she asked me to give you this painting.

448
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,599
To thank you for your companionship during this time.

449
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,870
She paid me for those medicinal herbs and supplies.

450
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,670
Why is Consort Shu so polite?

451
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:11,720
You often ride with Consort Shu. Your polo skills must have improved a lot.

452
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,519
Of course, do you dare compete with me someday?

453
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,160
How bold, do you dare bet on it?

454
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,080
Isn't the interest you've collected from me enough? Want to swindle me for more?

455
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,759
Don't even think about it.

456
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:27,280
Consort Shu has given you her well-bred horse.

457
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,540
With a fine horse, are you still afraid to lose?

458
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,919
Consort Shu has never looked down on me because of my rank.

459
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:38,139
She treats me well.

460
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:43,120
Now that she has returned, it's not as comfortable or free.

461
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,760
Could you persuade His Majesty to visit her more often?

462
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,359
At least let her see her child more often.

463
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:52,879
Don't worry, Consort Shu has been away from the palace for a while.

464
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,740
His Majesty also misses her greatly and will surely treat her well.

465
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,890
Sister, I've written another character, please check if it's correct.

466
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,530

467
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,280
I never taught you this character, how did you learn it?

468
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,039
I've been observing Fragrant Garden's plaque every day,

469
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,399
so I learned to write it.

470
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:19,560
Young Master Liu is smart. I'll teach you another character then.

471
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
The Garden in Fragrance Garden.

472
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,740
Here.

473
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:35,919
I'll write the outer part.

474
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,239
Give it a try.

475
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,560
Young Master Liu is clever,

476
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,680
but Mu Dan is busy with business and can't teach you every day.

477
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,860
How about I find you a private tutor?

478
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:58,640
I don't want any tutor, having Sister teach me is enough.

479
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,219
I only like to cook, and I'm not cut out for studying or being an official.

480
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,760
Becoming an official isn't the only path to success.

481
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,839
If you like cooking, I can hire a restaurant chef for you.

482
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,640
Learn from him for a few years, and then you can open your own restaurant.

483
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,680
Iâ€¦

484
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,479
I heard that Prosperity House's Chef Xue plans to take on an apprentice this year.

485
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:25,680
Really? That would be great.

486
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,479
Do you know him? Could you introduce him?

487
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,280
I can take Young Master Liu to visit him.

488
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,180
No problem.

489
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,439
Sister, I've heard Floral Envoy enjoys painting the beauties of Huanyun Tower.

490
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:43,080
Can you have Floral Envoy paint one of us?

491
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,340
Asking me to paint. Shouldn't you come ask me?

492
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:56,160
I'm not worthy of speaking to you,

493
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,519
so I can only ask Sister.

494
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,120
Young Master Liu, you have to respect yourself.

495
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,460
No matter what you want, you mustn't belittle yourself.

496
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,270
Do you understand?

497
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Understood.

498
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,980
I'm available today and in a good mood, so I'll paint one.

499
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:30,410
This painting is titled "Young Master Liu Admiring the Love of Mu Dan and Chang Yang."

500
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,319
Where's Young Master Liu?

501
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,840
This is a painting technique. He's not in the painting,

502
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,220
but viewing them from across.

503
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,879
This painting is nice hanging here.

504
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:46,080
All guests will know our deep affection in the future.

505
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,800
Mu Dan, something happened to Xiao Chun.

506
00:41:51,060 --> 00:42:01,020

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining

508
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:17,264
â™«  On the endless road to Chang'an,
 the zither and lute's melody echoes from afar  â™«

509
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:25,578
â™«  Plum and willow trees greet the Spring,
 as splendor returns this year  â™«

510
00:42:25,578 --> 00:42:33,770
â™«  Copper battlements shine as songs, dances, and glasses fill the palace air  â™«

511
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:42,022
â™«  Idle clouds and drifting duckweed, with a thousand flowers blooming  â™«

512
00:42:42,022 --> 00:42:50,219
â™«  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  â™«

513
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:58,506
â™«  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  â™«

514
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:06,922
â™«  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  â™«

515
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:15,022
â™«  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  â™«

516
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:42,974
â™«  The distant night sky, scattered with stars, reflects the gentle moon  â™«

517
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:50,425
â™«  The peony's exquisite beauty fills the fragrant garden  â™«

518
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:58,511
â™«  With my heart as a lantern, I fear not the journey through distant mountain paths  â™«

519
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:06,820
â™«  The jade flute's music fills a fleeting life with meaning  â™«

520
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:15,082
â™«  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  â™«

521
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:23,338
â™«  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  â™«

522
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:31,766
â™«  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  â™«

523
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:39,866
â™«  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  â™«
