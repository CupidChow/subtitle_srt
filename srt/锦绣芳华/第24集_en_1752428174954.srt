3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now we have a free cup.

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The latest 3-star Z series of folding bottles will take you to the main screen.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Old friend, new style.

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The rainbow steamed buns will take you to the main screen.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hato, come here.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hato, come here.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The one we talked about last time is not very fragrant.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are they doing?

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Da Fu, what are you guys talking about?

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look behind you.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look behind you.

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, Hato likes Li Xin, the son-in-law.

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're a son-in-law now.

16
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Really?

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Xiao Chun is so kind to save people.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've never seen him being interested in men and women.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's what happened to the lady.

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She wanted to rely on our son-in-law to get married.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, Hato, we've prepared a surprise for Xiao Chun.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You'll have to trick him.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't tell anyone.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Everyone heard it.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't tell anyone.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Really?

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want to marry a young man.

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A young man.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A young man.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A young man.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've hurt you so much.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What else can I do?

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're dead.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you regret it?

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In my life,

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll regret it only if I can live.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've been very lucky this year.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fever.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Did he throw up?

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Me, Tu Xiaonong?

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did he throw up?

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why did you betray my father?

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you're against him, why did you ask for my hand?

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why did you leave me to live?

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I hate you not.

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We are the same.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I hate your father.

50
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He broke my legs.

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He broke my bones.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He broke me.

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He became a pure gold-digger.

54
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have a father like that.

55
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He won't be happy if I marry him.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But even if he's a drunkard,

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
he's my father.

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't hate him.

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't deserve to be his daughter.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't take revenge.

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't do it either.

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I love you.

63
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Liu Chang.

64
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I ruined your life.

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll never forget you.

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're even now.

67
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Liu Chen.

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Liu Chang.

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We're even now.

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Liu Chang.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
From now on,

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm Liu Chang.

73
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm willing to be with Wu Qi.

74
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll never forget you.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll never forget you.

76
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I love you.

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I love you.

78
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do I look good?

79
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I like this one.

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, I'll take both.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Did you buy the doll?

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

83
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't buy such a child's doll.

84
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll try it.

85
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I want that one.

86
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Give it to me.

87
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I know the best.

88
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll take this one.

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go.

90
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What's the matter?

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You don't have to.

92
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll help you.

93
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll go to the front.

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Go ahead.

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are you doing?

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What are you doing?

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll help you.

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll help you.

99
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Goodbye.

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you.

101
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you.

102
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We haven't bought enough.

103
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When can we go to the restaurant

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and have a drink?

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No hurry.

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Although it's the last holiday,

107
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
we should understand

108
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the hard work of the ladies.

109
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
When they get in, they'll be happy.

110
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're so considerate.

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can win the hearts of the ladies.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thank you.

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You don't have to be so courteous

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to our students.

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't like to act.

116
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll help you.

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to buy a good jade for my lover.

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I bought it for her.

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll buy it for her.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can buy it for me.

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Be quiet.

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My lover is not a corrupt official.

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She can afford it.

124
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Look.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll buy it for her.

126
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll buy it for her.

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll buy it for her.

128
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll buy it for her.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll buy it for her.

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Buying the star in the sea

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
will bring radiance from beyond the horizon.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's move forward together.

133
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
After we move forward together,

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
we can do nothing,

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
no care about what God does for us and dead to us.

136
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Life is so grey here.

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,160
At that time in this

138
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,300
We will make new together.

139
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
Everything is on pitch.

140
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
It's done for that.

141
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,340
It's dirty!

142
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,980
It's a flower relationships

143
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,380
Zi Shu

144
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,560
Maybe

145
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
We can restart

146
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,440
A

147
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Qingqing

148
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,100
Stop rapping!

149
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,080
As you wish!

150
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,700
The bloodthirsty man is finally dead!

151
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,860
There is no one to hurt me!

152
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,060
He should...

153
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,880
Come on, let's play.

154
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
Come on, let's play.

155
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,360
Your SPD is high.

156
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,480
Stop.

157
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
Stop!

158
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,840
The water is dry.

159
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:17,060
The flowers bloom, the spring is white.

161
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:27,060
I see, I will not go.

162
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,060
I will not go.

163
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:43,060
The flowers bloom, the spring is white.

164
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,060
I see.

165
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:17,060
I will not go.

166
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:25,060
Master.

167
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:32,060
The Buddha's feet are clean, you can't get hurt.

168
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:38,060
I'm guilty, I don't deserve to live.

169
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Master's mercy shouldn't come to me.

170
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Tonight's House don't deserve death and relief.

171
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,140
Let me paddle down to get a self- piece

172
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,180
No, don't

173
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,580
It'll do

174
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,900
You've got a pretty decent State of 거...

175
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,760
Salым

176
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,980
You know, any young girls from Teacher Guo's class

177
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,840
always appears on my show

178
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,080
Well

179
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,340
Maybe they already 뵈

180
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,300
Are you saying that offspring

181
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,900
What a beautiful world!

182
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Why do you have to leave me?

183
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,100
I don't want to remember you.

184
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,300
I don't want to leave you.

185
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
The flowers are already blooming.

186
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Oh, my heart is silent.

187
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Oh, I wish to grow up,

188
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:34,300
to bloom and to grow old with you.

189
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Oh, my heart is silent.

190
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,900
No one wants to tell me what's in my heart.

191
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,300
I prepared all this for you.

192
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,700
The wind blows, the clouds fall.

193
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,900
Your birthday is in the spring.

194
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,700
But the spring is short.

195
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,900
And you always have so many troubles.

196
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,300
It's been a long time.

197
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,100
I can finally celebrate your birthday with you.

198
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,700
Now I think,

199
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,100
we were also in spring when we first met.

200
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:31,300
The wind blows, the clouds fall.

201
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:39,300
The wind blows, the clouds fall.

202
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Oh, my heart is silent.

203
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,300
I wish to grow up,

204
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,500
to bloom and to grow old with you.

205
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,900
Jiang Changyang.

206
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,500
You took away such an expensive peony.

207
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,700
You spent so much money.

208
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,300
These are not real flowers.

209
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,100
They are Lv Hangtou's feelings.

210
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,900
He made these peonies with your favorite peony.

211
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,900
Enough. Come out.

212
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,300
Even if Jiang Changyang has three heads and six arms,

213
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,700
he can't draw so well these days.

214
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
Come out.

215
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,100
Let's go.

216
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,300
You guys are really good.

217
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,700
And your cousin.

218
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,300
Now you can lie and change your face.

219
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
It's not all lies.

220
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Who did you give your lucky charm to?

221
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,700
Good job, cousin.

222
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
You got a beauty.

223
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I didn't find a good chance to tell you.

224
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,700
Come on, let's go and see how the noodles are cooked.

225
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Okay.

226
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Slow down.

227
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,100
I have something to do.

228
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
Come on, Yanyang.

229
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,700
Come on, stand in the middle.

230
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,700
It's because of your plan that I can remember it.

231
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
It's you.

232
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm back.

233
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm back.

234
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,500
Give it to me.

235
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
It's me.

236
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,700
What about that lady?

237
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
She's a good person.

238
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Let's go to the hospital.

239
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
Goodbye.

240
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,100
Don't hang up.

241
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,700
Who else?

242
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,900
The sun rises, the flowers bloom

243
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,700
This is me.

244
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,900
No, it's me.

245
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:32,100
The clouds are floating, the flowers bloom

246
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:40,500
The fire is flowing, the world is in a mess

247
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:48,340
Let a firefly fly all year round

248
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:55,780
My heart is like a honeyed string

249
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,340
the fingers are clenched with pain

250
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Can you explain to us what is human?

251
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,660
Which means worshipping you as an enemy?

252
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,320
What is it?

253
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,260
Don't talk.

254
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,060
Some of the traveling officers always say

255
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,940
that a beloved person wants someone to love him.

256
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,180
Am I right?

257
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,720
She didn't understand you.

258
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,300
Didn't I.

259
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,940
I didn't.

260
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,940
You should remember that affection is good for both of you.

261
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,280
You will become a better man.

262
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
The show is sponsored by Motherland.

263
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
We invite you to continue watching.

264
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,280
I'm lucky to have met you in this life.

265
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I have to say goodbye.

266
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Thank you for your company.

267
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
Thank you.

268
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Wait.

269
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Didn't we surprise her today?

270
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Who is the secret?

271
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
She's crying.

272
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
She must be worried about her makeup.

273
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
She has been working for several months.

274
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
Her hands are almost broken.

275
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Fang Jun.

276
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
You were the one who started the show.

277
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Why did you break your own stage?

278
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,280
What did she do to make you do everything?

279
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
You didn't tell me.

280
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,280
What are you hiding from me?

281
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Nothing.

282
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
What can I hide from you?

283
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Yang Sui Zhi.

284
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Do you think I don't know my cousin

285
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
or Xiaochun?

286
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Or I don't know you?

287
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
It's hard to say.

288
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
It's hard to say.

289
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Come on.

290
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Eat.

291
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Come on.

292
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Eat.

293
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Come on.

294
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Don't cry.

295
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Today is a good day.

296
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Come on.

297
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Eat.

298
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Here.

299
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Eat more.

300
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
It smells good.

301
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
What do you think of my new wine?

302
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Can you be the most famous?

303
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Just so so.

304
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
I'm kidding.

305
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Jin Niang's wine and Sixth Wolf's food

306
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
will make the most famous.

307
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I'll make a lot of money.

308
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Sister, Sixth Wolf has grown up.

309
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Now he can open his own shop.

310
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Don't worry.

311
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Now that the world is good,

312
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Madam's unfilial son is back, too.

313
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
He did a lot of work in our yard.

314
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
You can go to the shop.

315
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
With Madam watching,

316
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
he won't let a flower in the yard wither.

317
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Good.

318
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
The embroidery workshop of Sheng County is getting bigger.

319
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
The women from Pang County are helping.

320
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Yu Xianlin is very proud now.

321
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
When you come back,

322
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I'll show you the new warehouse.

323
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
You can do it.

324
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
I'll do my best.

325
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I found a woman who is as good as me.

326
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
She's willing to help me.

327
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Don't worry.

328
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay, Tang.

329
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,280
You can go with me.

330
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
It was good.

331
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
What happened?

332
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Don't worry.

333
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm not going to leave you.

334
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Yeah.

335
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
We've finally reunited.

336
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Why do you want to leave again?

337
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Madam,

338
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
flowers bloom and fall.

339
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
People will be together.

340
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Don't worry.

341
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Da Fu told me

342
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
he won't go with me this time.

343
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
He wants to stay and be filial.

344
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
Congratulations.

345
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Yes.

346
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Madam, I'm not going.

347
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I know you're worried

348
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
about me and Mudan.

349
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Chuan told me

350
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
you're not as strong as before.

351
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
You must not work too hard

352
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
or too hard.

353
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Besides,

354
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Chuan Yu and I are at home now.

355
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Chuan Yu.

356
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
We can do all the work

357
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
at home and in the shop.

358
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
You can just enjoy it.

359
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Okay.

360
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
If you have a baby,

361
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
I'll be fine.

362
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
An Ning.

363
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Chuan Yu.

364
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Mudan, I'm going with you.

365
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I don't dare.

366
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Fang Jun,

367
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
you must be careful

368
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
when you fight

369
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
without me.

370
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
You're better than you.

371
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
You came to me

372
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
without parents.

373
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
You've been through a lot.

374
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
You finally have your own home.

375
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
You must live a good life.

376
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
I'll go to the world of Yun.

377
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I'll stay in the capital

378
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
and be a good man.

379
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
You're going to do business.

380
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
You're not in the way.

381
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
You're my subordinate.

382
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
But you're also my real wife.

383
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
The Wuyong Hall is open again.

384
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
And now my father is old.

385
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
I want to spend more time with him.

386
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
You're in the capital and the holy county.

387
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
I can go to the south

388
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
to do business.

389
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Chuan, the Wuyong Hall

390
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
is up to you.

391
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Brother Sui Zhi,

392
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
you can go.

393
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
I'll be an official in the capital

394
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
and complete the will of the teacher.

395
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I won't let you down.

396
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Sister,

397
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
you've shown me

398
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
that the country is not the only way.

399
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
My mother didn't like the valley.

400
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Now she knows that my cousin

401
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
is not allowed to go there.

402
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
She's ashamed of herself.

403
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
I respect your past

404
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
and your future.

405
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Have a safe trip.

406
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Thank you, brother.

407
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Okay.

408
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
I'm going to do business.

409
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Why do I feel like I'm going to die?

410
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Fang Yuan is in Chang'an.

411
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
My family is in Chang'an.

412
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
In the future, Sui Zhi and I

413
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
will come back to visit you.

414
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Don't worry.

415
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
I'll take care of my mother.

416
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
If she loses weight next time,

417
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
I'll take care of her.

418
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Please continue watching.

419
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
I feel better after the evening breeze.

420
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
We're leaving tomorrow.

421
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
You're going to the palace today and saying goodbye to Shu Fei.

422
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Have you received our new household?

423
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Jiang Dashan, are you satisfied?

424
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,280
You have Shu Fei as your support.

425
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
I can't count on you.

426
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Never mind.

427
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
I'll accept it.

428
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
What's this?

429
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
What's this?

430
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Wang Xiyi and Mu Mu

431
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
are all in the court.

432
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
You were cheated by Fang Ya.

434
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
You rented this house.

435
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Now,

436
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
you've changed the layout of Jiang's mansion.

437
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
You've turned it into a house.

438
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
In the future,

439
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
it will be our home.

440
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
I was touched on my birthday.

441
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

442
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
The traffic light is my idea.

443
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
But everyone helped me.

444
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I found out that

445
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
I've made up for it.

446
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
I'll treat it as my wife's birthday gift.

447
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I won't refuse a good gift like this.

448
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Thank you, Jiang Changyang.

449
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Such an expensive gift.

450
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
You're so kind.

451
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I don't know what gift

452
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
I can give you in the future.

453
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
I don't know where we are.

454
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I don't know if anyone can help me.

455
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
A corrupt official is more difficult than a poor person.

456
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
You have to live a good life.

457
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We opened!

458
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And the wax fl проч has started!

459
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,920
Congratulations!

460
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Welcome everybody!

461
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
If you want to enter the Security Department,

462
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
I'll not see you from the front.

463
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,560
But if you want to get out,

464
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,200
We will work together in the future.

465
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,240
If you have any difficulties, please tell us.

466
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,920
The Chang'an Flower Shop is a good match for both men and women.

467
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,000
We have the opportunity to open our own shop.

468
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,320
Thank you, Master.

469
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,840
The flower shop is not built by me.

470
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,880
It was made by Master He, the head of the flower shop.

471
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I've heard of Master He.

472
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,480
But he's been involved with the husband.

473
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,680
He's been missing for a long time.

474
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,320
He must be a good man.

475
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,040
Yes, you don't have to worry about him.

476
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Master He is in the middle of the world.

477
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,920
He's selling the flower and the secret.

478
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,160
Thank you, Master.

479
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,640
Thank you.

480
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,320
Thank you, Master.

481
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,960
Lianniang.

482
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,760
This is for you.

483
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,600
From now on, you're free.

484
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,320
You don't have to worry about the ghost anymore.

485
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,960
Thank you, Master.

486
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,560
What are you doing? Get up.

487
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,000
Get up.

488
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Thank you, Master.

489
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,400
Look.

490
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,600
This is my shop.

491
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
Let's go inside.

492
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,080
There's a flower shop ahead.

493
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,200
The first floor is the fourth floor.

494
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,720
Lianniang, you grew up in the fishing village.

495
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
Do you know how to swim?

496
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,000
Yes.

497
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,560
Can you get used to the boat?

498
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,160
Yes.

499
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Great.

500
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
There's a boat.

501
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,840
You can find a Buddha there.

502
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Thank you, Master.

503
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,680
There are many ways to make money in this world.

504
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,440
I believe you can support yourself.

505
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,320
You can live better.

506
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,880
Okay.

507
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,080
Master, you're so capable.

508
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,720
You've already compared your husband to you.

509
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,920
How is he treating you?

510
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
You should be grateful for your husband.

511
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,480
He's very kind to me.

512
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,920
You'll see him soon.

513
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,320
The flower shop is ahead.

514
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
The pearl powder can be used to make it thinner.

515
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,920
How is it, Master?

516
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,920
Very good.

517
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,720
What about me?

518
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Not bad either.

519
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,120
Master, this is your husband.

520
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
Look at this.

521
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,720
You look good together.

522
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Jiang Dashan.

523
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,120
Mother.

524
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,920
Come with me.

525
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm just helping you sell the powder.

526
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Don't misunderstand.

527
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,720
I don't need a man like you to sell me the powder.

528
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,920
You need a man like me.

529
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Look at this.

530
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Pick more.

531
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Look at this.

532
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Good!

533
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,120
You're getting better.

534
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Those housewives wouldn't think I'm a secret agent.

535
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
I saw you outside.

536
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,120
You seemed very happy.

537
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,120
It's just a show.

538
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,120
I'm just happy to be with you.

539
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Go away.

540
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
Come here.

541
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
I have something important to tell you.

542
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,920
I've been in Yangzhou for months.

543
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
I've been paying my taxes.

544
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,120
I haven't received any new information.

545
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
What about you?

546
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Did you find anything useful?

547
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,720
I was in the capital with my wife last month.

548
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,320
It's been half a month since I left.

549
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm going to the hunting with my wife again this month.

550
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm trying to get to the river.

551
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
I'm trying to get to the river.

552
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
I've been working all week.

553
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,920
I'm trying to get to the river.

554
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
You're a good person.

555
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
You're a good person.

556
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,920
But you're not a good agent.

557
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
But you're not a good agent.

558
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,920
I'll see you when I'm ready.

559
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
I have something to do.

560
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't need to wait for dinner tonight.

561
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
You haven't eaten with me for days.

562
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
What are you going to do today?

563
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,920
I'm going to tell the old people about the saint.

564
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Many officials are watching me.

565
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,920
They want me to take care of them in my mansion.

566
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Such a good art is only for the good people.

567
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Such a capable person.

568
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Of course, they will come to our Wu Yongtang.

569
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
The garlic is so fragrant.

570
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,920
The Wu Yongtang has a deputy saint.

571
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,920
So all the Wu Yongtang in the nine states have a deputy saint.

572
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,920
The deputy saint can leave Chang'an.

573
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,920
It means he's not a person who is chasing after the people.

574
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,920
I believe he would like to be with me.

575
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
To save more people.

576
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,920
Okay, I'll meet him with others.

577
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,920
What do you think of my idea?

578
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,920
I şeyler it to you?

579
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Violations?

580
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Some businessmen have sealed the contract.

581
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
Let's go.

582
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Come in.

583
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Your Majesty.

584
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,920
Bring it here.

585
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Mudan is so strange.

586
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,920
She sends the most special gift to everyone.

587
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,920
The one who has no conscience will only send me a report of the inspection.

588
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I feel so good.

589
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
This is a small report.

590
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
I don't know how much effort it took.

591
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Since the third husband misses her,

592
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,920
why don't you write a letter to her to go back to the capital for the New Year?

593
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Come on, taste it.

594
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Xiaochun.

595
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Your letter.

596
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Thank you.

597
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
Look, Chenyin.

598
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Sister, I'll send you a letter.

599
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
You can't drink if you're sick.

600
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
I'll give you a small mouthful.

601
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
I'll pack up and go to Mudan.

602
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
Great.

603
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Here, this wine is good.

604
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,920
I'll send you a letter.

605
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
This is the wife and the husband.

606
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,920
So beautiful.

607
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
So beautiful.

608
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
suspenseful

609
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
laugh

610
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
down

611
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
down

612
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
water

613
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
and

614
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
wall

615
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,920
The person who comes and goes daily during the quake

616
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
is pretty good at cooking.

617
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
At worst, it'll take money to do so.

618
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
I'm a man of good taste.

619
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,920
I can only recharge the money.

620
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,920
I wish the Wu Yongtang lower-level store can have a less huge sales and medias.

621
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,920
Less patients, less suffering.

622
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720
What about your business?

623
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,960
Sell medicine if in need,

624
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,600
sell flowers if not sick.

625
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,600
If all the people in the world can be healthy and not sick,

626
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,800
have a home and a home with flowers,

627
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,800
have a heart,

628
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,760
that's the best day.

629
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,800
All right, I'm going to see the new herbs in Wuyong Hall.

630
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,920
You go back first.

631
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,440
Today the business is closed,

632
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,680
I'm with you.

633
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,480
This is my personal opinion.

634
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,040
Jiang Dashan, you are really sticky.

635
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,960
You pushed the wall,

636
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,240
you chose the person.

637
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,000
Now you are back.

638
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,320
I see, you all caught me.

639
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,560
I'm coming.

640
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,840
Little elephant,

641
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,320
too slow.

642
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,600
Wait for me.

643
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,120
Slow down.
