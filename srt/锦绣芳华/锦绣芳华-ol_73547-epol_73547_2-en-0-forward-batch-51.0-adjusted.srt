00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:28,140

3
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,870

4
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,759
You saved my entire family.

5
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,439
I originally thought you did it for justice, and I was grateful.

6
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,759
I didn't expect that you had known my daughter for some time.

7
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,339
You even encouraged her to practice medicine and open a clinic.

8
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:49,899
If it weren't for a customer of the flower guild informing me, I'd still be in the dark.

9
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,440
Chun'er's reputation was almost ruined by you.

10
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,200
We didn't do wrong. Xiao Chun sincerely likes healing and helping others.

11
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:04,519
Guild Master, Xiao Chun has a talent for medicine.

12
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,560
Even Master Physician Fu from the Imperial Medical Bureau has praised her.

13
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,659
If you forcibly keep her at home and force her to marry and have children,

14
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm afraid she'll suffer for a lifetime.

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,679
Marrying is the right path for a woman!

16
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,219
I wholeheartedly want the best for her and to find her a good family!

17
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,580
But you two? Indulge her mischief!

18
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,800
Pushing her into a pit of fire!

19
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,539
You may leave. Stay away from Chun'er!

20
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,979
- See the guests out!
 - Yes.

21
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,300
The clinic and practicing medicine were my own ideas, not influenced by others.

22
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,819
Master, she smashed the betrothal gifts the Hu family sent, and we couldn't stop her.

23
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:49,240
You were gentle and obedient before. How did you turn into this?

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,140
This is my true nature.

25
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,099
Previously, I was afraid of upsetting you, so I pretended to be gentle and decent.

26
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,259
Father, I don't want a blind marriage. I want to keep practicing medicine.

27
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,200
A woman practicing medicine is looked down upon. It's a disgrace to feminine virtue.

28
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,119
Respectable families will look down on you. Do you intend never to marry?

29
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,719
As for a so-called good husband,

30
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,679
if he looks down on me because I'm a female physician, he isn't worth marrying.

31
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:17,160
You can't distinguish right from wrong, uttering wild words.

32
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
Just look at you,

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,800
if your mother saw this, she wouldn't rest in peace even in the afterlife!

34
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,740
May I ask, Father, was my mother not virtuous enough?

35
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,760
Where was her happiness?

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,839
Because you said appearing in public was a disgrace to family values,

37
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,559
- she was confined and died in melancholy!
 - Are you blaming me?

38
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:40,539
Do you know what she truly loved? Do you know what her ideals and ambitions were?

39
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,539
You buried my mother's life. Are you going to bury mine too?

40
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,399
You love flowers, so you can make a career out of it.

41
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,659
Why can't Xiao Chun do what she loves just because she's a woman?

42
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,879
Isn't that too tyrannical?!

43
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:05,480
Xiao Chun's skillful hands and open heart make everyone in Huamanzhu respect her.

44
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,879
The patients she has cured respect and love her even more.

45
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,679
We were wrong to hide our actions from you.

46
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,179
But there's nothing wrong with Xiao Chun practicing medicine.

47
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,500
Shopkeeper He, you deviate from convention.

48
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,680
You became a concubine for an official. I can't let my daughter take that path!

49
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,760
Father.

50
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,279
Chun'er, you've grown up now.

51
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,280
Now that you have friends and confidence, do you no longer need this family?

52
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,319
Let me ask you one last time, do you want to stay and be my daughter

53
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,240
or step out of this door to pursue your so-called path of medicine?!

54
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,099
I really can't have both?

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
No.

56
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,419
From now on, the Lu family doesn't have an unfilial daughter like you!

57
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:53,820
My father once said that dandelions scattered by the wind are unlucky in a home.

58
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,439
Because I liked them, we planted them anyway.

59
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,979
But he didn't know that I regarded this as medicine.

60
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,539
It was for the roots once the flowers fell, to treat his throat pain and lung abscess.

61
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,079
But now, the words have come true, and we are indeed scattered.

62
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:23,979
It's because he cares so much that he would be this stubborn.

63
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:29,520
Xiao Chun, for the next few days, stay at Fragrance Garden.

64
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Give your father some time, so he can think it over.

65
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,460
Yes, we'll come back after Guild Master's anger subsides.

66
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,199
He can't bear to not acknowledge you.

67
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:06,620

68
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,119
Young Master Liu has never seen 100 boats set sail together.

69
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,720
I want to take him to broaden his horizons. You don't mind, do you?

70
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Of course not.

71
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:30,859
You don't ride horses, do you? Would you like to share a horse with Chuan Yu?

72
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:34,099
You can enjoy the bright spring scenery of Chang'an along the way.

73
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,759
I've always treated you with respect. Where did I offend you?

74
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,470
What's wrong?

75
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
The Floral Envoy won't let me on this carriage, sending me off to ride a horse.

76
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,679
Perhaps he thinks I'm too sickly and fear I'll spread illness.

77
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,600
But how could I possibly ride such a tall horse? What if I accidentally fall?

78
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,979
Are you so intolerant of me?

79
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,940
Arguing or joking is fine, but falsely accusing me of endangering you isn't right, is it?

80
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,480
If you want to share the carriage with me, just say so. Why lie and slander others?

81
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,840
This isn't the behavior of a true and virtuous gentleman.

82
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,679
I know I was wrong.

83
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,380
Since you know you're wrong, shouldn't you apologize to your brother-in-law?

84
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,319
I'm sorry, I won't do this again in the future.

85
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,219
It's okay.

86
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,480
I won't go to the dock today. Sister...

87
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,400
Sister, you and Brother-in-law should set off now. Don't miss the time.

88
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,660
All right. Since we've promised you, how can we break our word?

89
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,419
I'll go with Chuan Yu and get the horse.

90
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,319
Get on the carriage.

91
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,599
Your sister has always been like this.

92
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,120
She still explains the principles, and also fears you may actually get hurt.

93
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,919
Just ride with us in the same carriage.

94
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:19,020
No need to thank me. Being a brother-in-law, it's the right thing to do.

95
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,799
 Candided haws.

96
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,500
 Fragrant sachets!

97
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,740
This river is wide, and the dock is extraordinary.

98
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,839
 Pitch-pot for prizes!

99
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,340
Young Master Liu, look.

100
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,100
There's a pitch-pot for prizes stall over there. Let's go and play together.

101
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,740
 Pitch-pot for prizes!

102
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,060
My arm strength is insufficient. I'm sure I'll miss the target, so forget it.

103
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,359
I understand.

104
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:55,539
I'm a humble servant while you're Young Madam's younger brother.

105
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:58,679
You definitely wouldn't want to play with people like us.

106
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,080
- That's not the case, I…
 - Then you're willing! Let's go.

107
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,280
Young Master Liu, go play. Give that to me.

108
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,160
Let's go! Come on.

109
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Have fun.

110
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,980
I just said you're not scheming and magnanimous.

111
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,319
Why are you teasing Young Master Liu now?

112
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,740
I just gave Chuan Yu a glance. Chuan Yu used his methods against him.

113
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,040
Your bias is strong, you're blaming me now.

114
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,400
Young Master Liu is sensitive in nature and somewhat biased in his actions.

115
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,000
I actually know all his little tricks.

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,679
But I believe that with careful instruction, this can be changed.

117
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,479
We're all family, naturally, we should be more tolerant.

118
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,600
Why are you arguing with a child?

119
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,559
Okay, okay, it's your good brother.

120
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,220
In the future, I'll be more patient and teach carefully, okay?

121
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:05,359
Previously, the sailors represented them in discussions.

122
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,320
Now the letter says it's the bowman who wants to see me.

123
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,839
I don't know who the other party is.

124
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,520
I don't know if he'll be satisfied with the gifts I brought.

125
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,459
Make way, make way.

126
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,360
Make way.

127
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,260
- Hey, watch your step.
 - Make way.

128
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,340
Make way.

129
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,420
What are you looking at?

130
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,240
The prosperous scene.

131
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,719
 The finest spring tea!

132
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,619
 Here it is, please enjoy.

133
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,780
Miss He.

134
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,399
I'll head in then.

135
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,620
Please come inside.

136
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,880

137
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,559
You're here.

138
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,640
What does this mean? My husband is still waiting by the shore.

139
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,699
If he sees that I haven't returned for a long time, he'll definitely cause a scene.

140
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,800
I know your temperament.

141
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,479
If I make any move, you'll jump into the river to leave.

142
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,760
When does it need to come to him?

143
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,959
Since we're here, why not have a cup of tea?

144
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,440
Let's discuss business before leaving.

145
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,880
 What exactly does Prince Ning want to smuggle?

146
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,500
 Normal merchant ships can't hold it, so he needs to privately build such a big ship.

147
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:04,359
It snows in the winter, and the docks freeze over.

148
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:07,800
The boatman told me the rules of the ships.

149
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,720
When the snow melts and sailing resumes,

150
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,940
the first block of river ice is kept to brew tea.

151
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,939
To bless the new year with calm seas and smooth journeys.

152
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,400
I didn't originally believe it. But since I thought I'd see you today,

153
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,419
I decided to seek some good fortune.

154
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,220
You invited me here today, what exactly for?

155
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,819
It's been a long time since I last saw you. Let's reminisce first, then talk business.

156
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,040
After my grand wedding, I made up my mind

157
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,599
to handle my duties well and achieve political accomplishments.

158
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,800
Then greet you with a new version of myself.

159
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,439
These days I've been dredging silt, expanding the river channels,

160
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,268
forming a fleet, and expanding navigation.

161
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,000
I've won public praise.

162
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,280
It's because I thought of you,

163
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,160
that I designated this pier for both official and civilian use.

164
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,640
A market is open for crew purchases.

165
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,439
Merchants became wealthy, and the people found convenience.

166
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,380
Today's prosperity is also due to your contribution.

167
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,719
Congratulations on achieving your past vision, but this has nothing to do with me.

168
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,520
It wasn't easy for you, so I hope you'll cherish it.

169
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,020
Let's talk about matters related to you then.

170
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:55,819
If you transport goods here, you can be exempt from taxes and enjoy priority departure rights.

171
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,859
Thank you for the kind offer, but I can't accept a reward without merit.

172
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:04,300
I hope you'll treat me the same as other merchants.

173
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,119
You're indeed the same old He Wei Fang.

174
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,000
But I'm no longer the Liu Chang I used to be.

175
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,459
Now I have nothing but patience for my goals and the people I seek.

176
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,760
I'll break next year's river ice with you and brew tea together.

177
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,159
We can't be a couple, but I hope for a long-lasting companionship.

178
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:38,439
Abducting a married woman, neglecting husbandly virtues.

179
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:42,520
If Prince Ning heard your words, what would he think?

180
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,719
Liu Chang, I originally thought you would've realized something.

181
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:53,920
I didn't expect that you've not only made no progress, but still indulge in delusion.

182
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,839
You and I have long been unrelated.

183
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,340
If you act willfully, it'll only harm others and yourself.

184
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,760
I've said my piece. If there's nothing else, please dock.

185
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,980
Mu Dan.

186
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,070
We have a long future ahead of us.

187
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,580
- Dock.
 - Yes, Sir.

188
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,639
Young Master Jiang, you seem quite free today.

189
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,319
Accompanying us and waiting here for me.

190
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,359
There's truly no other purpose?

191
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:40,019
Liu Chang was meeting with you. As your husband, shouldn't I watch closely?

192
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,399
Since you knew it was him, why didn't you tell me in advance?

193
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:50,079
I only knew he had built this pier.

194
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,079
Who would have thought he would disguise as a bowman and secretly meet someone else's wife?

195
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,379
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:00,910
I didn't have a secret meeting with him. My relationship with him is innocent.

197
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,400
I was here to discuss business.

198
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,219
You didn't even present the gifts. Seems the discussion didn't go well.

199
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,280
Just now I happened upon this item in the market.

200
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,559
I heard the mother-of-pearl bracelet can reflect light.

201
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,359
By day, it shows wealth, and by night, it lights up with beautiful people.

202
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,580
In the future, it'll be more convenient for you to tend flowers and plants at night.

203
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,119
This is nice.

204
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,879
Isn't this like an affordable and portable night pearl for commoners?

205
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,800
This is a good business opportunity.

206
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,019
In your mind, there's nothing but business?

207
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:52,559
Just now on the boat, you two...

208
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,119
I saw that this fruit wasn't ripe. Fortunately I didn't eat it.

209
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,599
Enjoy the sourness.

210
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,899
He Wei Fang, even His Majesty never asked me to taste poison, you…

211
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,580
Young Master, the merchants appreciate your kindness and have sent you another batch of tea cakes.

212
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,079
Young Master strolled around the newly opened market at the pier after work.

213
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,680
Then, he returned to the Taoguang Courtyard.

214
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,559
For dinner, he had two pieces of Hu cakes and a bowl of soup.

215
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,060
He also ate cherries after the meal.

216
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,720
Cherries? He never liked eating this fruit.

217
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,000
But the young servant said not only did he eat it, he ate a lot.

218
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Maybe this year's cherries are big and sweet, so he wanted something fresh.

219
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,199
I understand Zi Shu. He's stubborn,

220
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:08,459
it's very difficult to change what he likes or dislikes.

221
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,259
How could he suddenly change his taste?

222
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,579
After Zi Shu falls asleep, secretly call over the people who were with him one by one.

223
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,530
- I want to interrogate them.
 - Yes.

224
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,490

225
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,200
The Princess has made herself very clear. What are your plans?

226
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,919
Your Highness, Floral Haven has always conducted business properly without any errors.

227
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,240
Now, Miss He is on good terms with Consort Shu, and the Floral Envoy's beloved wife.

228
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,839
I'm incompetent and really don't know how to handle this.

229
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,200
Is it incompetence or unwillingness to handle it?

230
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I dare not.

231
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,839
Your Highness, I heard He Wei Fang incited the Guild Master's daughter to leave home.

232
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,440
She even exposed herself in her clinic to diagnose illnesses for people.

233
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,720
He Wei Fang treated the Lu family like this, yet the Guild Master endures it.

234
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,159
I'm afraid it's truly incompetence.

235
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,760
How can the position of guild master be held by someone incompetent?

236
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,039
When this flower withers, if Floral Haven is still around,

237
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,780
there's no need for the Lu family to exist.

238
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,300
Your Highness, please allow me to report!

239
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,000
Stop the carriage!

240
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,759
Who is so presumptuous and dares to run into the Princess' carriage!

241
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm from the flower guild and am willing to share Your Highness's worries.

242
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:36,099
Go and make arrangements properly. Act cautiously,

243
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,960
don't say what you shouldn't.

244
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,359
I understand.

245
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:45,580
Once this matter is handled well, the guild will change.

246
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,760
My daughter, you've been so wronged.

247
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,399
Everyone!

248
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:06,419
After taking the Tranquil Health Clinic Yunbin Pill, Madam Wu died.

249
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,599
Ruthless merchants manufacture fake medicine, harming lives!

250
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,340
Today, we must give justice to the victim!

251
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,319
Hundreds of Yunbin Pills have been sold without any incidents.

252
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,760
I took Madam Wu's pulse.

253
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,960
Her constitution suits Yunbin Pill. There would definitely be no problem.

254
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,580
There must be other reasons.

255
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,180
As a woman, what do you know about medical principles?

256
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,200
You've just being tricked by He Wei Fang to do business.

257
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,659
- Don't make mistake after mistake!
 - No.

258
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,259
The real harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang! Come out, He Wei Fang!

259
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:38,599
- Come out!
 - Harmful scoundrel!

260
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,459
The harmful scoundrel is He Wei Fang!

261
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:44,960
There's nothing wrong with the clinic's pills! I have evidence!

262
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,300
Everyone, I know the sale of medicine involves the health of the people, so we must be cautious.

263
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,119
A part of every batch of medicine from the clinic is stored in the storeroom.

264
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,760
- That's right.
 - This is the sample on the day Madam Wu bought it.

265
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,240
The storeroom records the dates of deposit and withdrawal on a slip.

266
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,900
There is a seal on this brocade box, which can prove that I've never touched it.

267
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,919
I will hand over this box sealed intact to the authorities for inspection.

268
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,960
To prove that there's absolutely no problem with our clinic's pills.

269
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Madam Wu's death has nothing to do with Tranquil Health Clinic.

270
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,779
She's willing to let authorities inspect it. She must have a clear conscience.

271
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,280
- There definitely shouldn't be a problem.
 - Exactly.

272
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,760
- Exactly.
 - Better to investigate thoroughly.

273
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,720
Miss He, what's the point of proving the pills are harmless?

274
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,199
If the medical skill is poor and misdiagnosis occurs, even good medicine

275
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,960
can still cause death.

276
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:46,580
The coroner's report is here,

277
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,280
proving Madam Wu's stomach was extremely weak and died from food consumption.

278
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,200
But her diet was no different from usual, except for the recently bought Yunbin Pill.

279
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,399
This medicine is the culprit!

280
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,940
Do you believe the arguments of a deceitful merchant, or the words on paper?

281
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,559
Give me back my daughter's life.

282
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,559
Madam. Calm down.

283
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,019
- This is the Yunbin Pill.
 - Xiao Chun!

284
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,839
The harmful, life-taking medicine cannot be kept.

285
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,000
Stop hitting her!

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,824
Tranquil Health Clinic can't stay!

287
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,220
- Give it back to me.
 - Take them away!

288
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,319
- What are you doing?
 - Stop!

289
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,799
- What are you doing?
 - Move!

290
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,279
- This has nothing to do with the clinic!
 - You've got the wrong person. It wasn't us!

291
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,740
Give me back my daughter.

292
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,530

293
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,219
Don't cry, Xiao Chun. I'm all right.

294
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,340
Don't worry about me.

295
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,720
I dragged you into this today. I'm sorry.

296
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,699
If you hadn't helped me open the clinic, Cao Yu Ying wouldn't have found this excuse.

297
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:30,980
I just don't know who the person behind him is.

298
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,450
They even bribed the County Magistrate.

299
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,160
We'll know sooner or later.

300
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:46,699
What's most important is how we prove our innocence.

301
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,839
If I could closely examine Madam Wu, I could find why she died.

302
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,680
Unfortunately, we're trapped here,

303
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,970
I can't do anything.

304
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:07,120
I don't know if my father has heard about this.

305
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,620
Would he be worried?

306
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,750
When people are in distress,

307
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,159
the first person they think of is the one they care about the most.

308
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,960
You were angry with him before, but now he's still the one you worry about most.

309
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:30,229
Don't cry anymore.

310
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:32,480
After we get out,

311
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,480
you should go home and have a good talk with him. Okay?

312
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,119
Don't cry.

313
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:46,319
Half an incense stick time, finish speaking, and then leave.

314
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:48,319
Thank you, Sir.

315
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,100
Father...

316
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,200
Hurry, go on.

317
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Chun'er.

318
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,359
Father.

319
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
How did you get injured like this?

320
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,600
It was Mu Dan protecting me,

321
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,680
- otherwise, it would've been worse.
 - If you had listened and stayed home to get married,

322
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,279
you wouldn't have to suffer like this.

323
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,850
Shopkeeper He, you protected my daughter in times of trouble.

324
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm immensely grateful.

325
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,419
But you women doing business ultimately caused trouble.

326
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,520
Do you also think that my poor medical skills caused someone's death?

327
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,300
That's not important. Rescuing you two is what matters most.

328
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,440
This is important. It's the most important thing to me.

329
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,800
Today's disaster wasn't because of my practice. We were deliberately framed.

330
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,559
I researched the prescription for months. Hundreds have taken it without adverse effects.

331
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,319
Patients whom I've never met were willing to trust my medical skills.

332
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,839
Why is it worthless in your eyes? Why won't you trust me?

333
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,660
- You're my father.
 - Xiao Chun.

334
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Guild Master, it's really not Xiao Chun's fault.

335
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,739
It started because of me. I implicated her.

336
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,240
I'll definitely find a way to prove Xiao Chun's innocence.

337
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,520
The key to this case now is whether there's a problem with the medicine.

338
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,639
You're already in such a condition. How can you prove her innocence?

339
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:38,240
I told you not to push her into the fire pit.

340
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,580
A woman practicing medicine will constantly encounter problems.

341
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,910
Since you're convinced that my medical practice caused a disaster, dishonoring the Lu family,

342
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,639
in the future, you don't have a daughter anymore.

343
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,960
Guild Master, please go back.

344
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,119
It's come to this point, and you're still so stubborn.

345
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:00,880
Do you really want to die in prison?!

346
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,840
Guild Master, can you really bear to let Xiao Chun bear a murder charge?

347
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,780
Will you let it end like this, unclear and unresolved?

348
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,300
Calmly think it over.

349
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,440
If we really caused her death, why won't the County Magistrate hold a public trial?

350
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,019
Why would he rather violate the law to use private punishment against us?

351
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:26,520
Why force us to confess and sign?

352
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,839
Only by clarifying all these issues

353
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,979
can Xiao Chun truly be exonerated.

354
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,420
It really can shine at night.

355
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,730
Jiang Chang Yang didn't lie to me.

356
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,890
In times of trouble,

357
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,270
was the first person I thought of... really you?

358
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:54,480
Xiao Chun's father had to bribe all around to get in.

359
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,559
You came in so easily, you're indeed the Floral Envoy.

360
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:06,380
The case hasn't yet been clarified, yet they dare torture you.

361
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,860
Who gave the order?

362
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,180
In Chang'an, who else can pin such a crime on me without due process?

363
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,800
And ignore your dignity to accuse me of such a great crime?

364
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,939
Naturally, it could only be that person.

365
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,079
Where are we going?

366
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,960
Taking my wife away from here.

367
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,040
No, if I go with you,

368
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,219
it would truly make me a profiteer who relies on official power to take lives?

369
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,919
Someone is putting pressure on the Magistrate. He won't handle it impartially.

370
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,399
I must thoroughly investigate this case

371
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,979
and find irrefutable evidence to bring it to trial.

372
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,459
I want Cao Yu Ying and the County Magistrate to see.

373
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,960
Let the entire city's people and the person behind this see.

374
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,399
Xiao Chun and I will walk out of this cell with dignity, innocent.

375
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,500
All right.

376
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,159
However, if I do nothing when my wife is in trouble, isn't that suspicious?

377
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,119
You must already have a plan in mind.

378
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,959
If there's anything you need, just let me know.

379
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,700
Thank you for your righteous support.

380
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:41,440
Although I can't leave this cell now,

381
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,040
I've already planned all the matters regarding the investigation.

382
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,573
Just pass on a message for me.

383
00:34:48,573 --> 00:34:51,230

384
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,719
How is it?

385
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,080
Envoy Jiang, Madam Wu had previously given birth.

386
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,839
It wasn't the weak stomach that led to her death.

387
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,299
When she should've been nourished, she consumed large amounts of toxic cold food.

388
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:11,919
This resulted in continuous bleeding and blood deficiency, leading to death.

389
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:15,196
I'm worried that the coroner had been bribed. We changed the person inspecting,

390
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,760
but still couldn't diagnose the illness. Why is this?

391
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,800
Most coroners are men and naturally understand common illnesses,

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,160
but many women are too embarrassed to seek treatment when ill.

393
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,399
They haven't seen as many female patients as we female physicians have.

394
00:35:27,399 --> 00:35:31,520
It's common for them to overlook hidden ailments in female corpses.

395
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:36,720
No wonder Mu Dan asked me to message Consort Shu to find a female physician.

396
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,210
The Yunbin Pill is mild and harmless.

397
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,550
Madam Wu must have died from consuming something else.

398
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,660
I understand.

399
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,310
Please convey my gratitude to Consort Shu upon returning to the palace.

400
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,659
Young Master.

401
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,180
Da Fu has followed Madam's arrangements and gathered all the evidence.

402
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,839
Madam Tang learned from the flower guild's floriculturist,

403
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:13,919
 Madam Wu was Cao Yu Ying's concubine, usually hidden in Dingzi Alley.

404
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:18,479
 He doesn't understand medicine, so five days ago, he found a physician,

405
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,439
 said his concubine had just given birth and asked about dietary restrictions.

406
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:27,200
 Next, he went to a pharmacy and bought some cold items for postpartum women.

407
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Someone in Dingzi Alley saw him carrying crabs and bezoar to Madam Wu's home.

408
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,479
The next day, her death was reported.

409
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,720
Da Fu has obtained testimony from all parties.

410
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,999
There's a purchase receipt from the pharmacy, and food scraps from Madam Wu's kitchen.

411
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,720
Tomorrow in court, Madam will surely be able to clear her name.

412
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,939
Young Master, rest assured.

413
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,519
To ensure no future trouble, there's still someone I must meet with.

414
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,620
Why did you have the time to grace Prince Ning Residence today?

415
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,280
These days, my concubine was framed and suffered imprisonment.

416
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,739
I was so furious that I made a scene at the government office.

417
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:27,039
However, I unexpectedly found something missing from your residence, so I came to return it.

418
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,800
So, you're here to demand justice.

419
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,039
He Wei Fang caused me to fall from my horse.

420
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,039
I didn't kill her, that was already merciful.

421
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,879
Your plight invokes sympathy, but what's done cannot be undone.

422
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:57,739
Now you've married your beloved as you wished.

423
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:03,519
His Highness sought justice for you and promoted Zi Shu to Deputy Transport Officer.

424
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,519
Now he's flourishing like the rising sun, and His Highness has gained a valuable person.

425
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,979
It can be said that everyone is satisfied and got what they wanted.

426
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,660
Why do you keep holding onto my wife?

427
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:21,680
How can the justice my father sought for me

428
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,680
make up for the heart-wrenching pain I suffered?

429
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,979
I can't say whether it can be made up for or not.

430
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,680
But since His Highness promised me at that time, I don't regret this decision.

431
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,959
If you insist on regretting the move,

432
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:44,039
I don't mind being a scoundrel and making a scene in front of His Majesty.

433
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,479
The granted position can be withdrawn.

434
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,399
What exactly do you want?

435
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,640
You suffered from falling off the horse, and my concubine was seriously injured in prison.

436
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,760
In my opinion, let's call it even and put this matter behind us completely.

437
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,280
From now on, I'll continue to maintain a close relationship with His Highness.

438
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,419
However, you and Zi Shu should have less interaction with us two,

439
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:21,280
so as not to trigger distress.

440
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,200
After all, the most important thing for you two is the harmony between spouses.

441
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,399
What do you think, Princess?

442
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,959
Let's do as you say.

443
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:54,680
Returning the lost item was not easy.

444
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,300
A slightest negligence may result in losing it again. I hope you'll cherish it.

445
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:19,180
Your Highness, are you really going to let He Wei Fang go just like that?

446
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:35,220
Jiang Chang Yang cherishes Miss He so much, and she has no interest in Zi Shu.

447
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:40,180
It seems Zi Shu doesn't have a chance.

448
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,690
Let it be.

449
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,420
Yes.

450
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,039
What about Cao Yu Ying?

451
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,600
Rest assured, Your Highness. He still has a family.

452
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,120
No matter what crime he's convicted of, he'll bear it and won't speak carelessly.

453
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,139
I'll handle everything properly. Young Master won't find anything out.

454
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,879
Cao Yu Ying poisoned a civilian woman and framed others.

455
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:14,339
The evidence is conclusive. He ought to be executed!

456
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,680
The execution will take place after autumn.

457
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,099
The two from Tranquil Health Clinic are innocent and are to be released immediately.

458
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:25,600
 - Great!
 - Great!

459
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,720
Animal! Give me back my daughter!

460
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,730

00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:10,411
♫  Plum and willow trees greet the Spring,
 as splendor returns this year  ♫

465
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:18,603
♫  Copper battlements shine as songs, dances, and glasses fill the palace air  ♫

466
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:26,855
♫  Idle clouds and drifting duckweed, with a thousand flowers blooming  ♫

467
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:35,152
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

468
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:43,339
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

469
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:51,755
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

470
00:42:51,755 --> 00:42:59,655
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫

471
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:27,907
♫  The distant night sky, scattered with stars, reflects the gentle moon  ♫

472
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:35,258
♫  The peony's exquisite beauty fills the fragrant garden  ♫

473
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:43,344
♫  With my heart as a lantern, I fear not the journey through distant mountain paths  ♫

474
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:51,653
♫  The jade flute's music fills a fleeting life with meaning  ♫

475
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:59,915
♫  Time flows gracefully, with moments gathering in the fading mist  ♫

476
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:08,071
♫  Let the years pass, carried by the wind toward long-held desires  ♫

477
00:44:08,071 --> 00:44:16,599
♫  If the heart remains as still as water, youth becomes eternal  ♫

478
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:24,599
♫  Still cherishing the moon of my hometown, yearning to meet again  ♫
