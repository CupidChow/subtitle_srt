2
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,152

3
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:58,000

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,759
Bravo!

5
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
- Dismount.
  - Yes, Sir!

6
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,840
Make way!

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,640
Bravo!

8
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:35,279
Captain Pei, you give me too much credit.

9
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:40,659
Young Master is currently in the palace with Miss Xiao and the Royal Princess.

10
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:43,499
Why would he come all the way here just for me?

11
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,260
Honestly, in his eyes,

12
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm merely a humble wife who earns money for him.

13
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,900
After my death, all my property will go to my husband's family.

14
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,580
If he were to cry for me for one day, it would mean he got sentimental.

15
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:07,099
You bet on the wrong person.

16
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,860
When he sobers up tomorrow in the residence,

17
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,740
he might not even notice that I haven't returned to the residence.

18
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,300
You're pouring me a drink, yet you tie my hands.

19
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,460
How am I supposed to drink it?

20
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,460
Rather than waiting with me until tomorrow, why don't you untie me first?

21
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,979
How about I accompany you to enjoy the moon and drink together?

22
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,900
It seems I won the bet.

23
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,499
If Jiang Chang Yang dies before you,

24
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,710
I wonder...

25
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,470
how many days you would cry.

26
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,152
Jiang Chang Yang!

27
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,900
Don't move!

28
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,740
Put down the knife and tell your people to leave.

29
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,368
Quick!

30
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:43,820
You love your wife so dearly,

31
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,940
so you should know how painful it is to have your loved one taken away.

32
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,859
Xue Xi and I share only sibling-like feelings.

33
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,859
She avoids you only because she hasn't yet gotten over the last event.

34
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,820
You can't fulfill His Highness's task, so you take your anger out on me.

35
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,900
- That isn't proper, right?
 - It sounds nice.

36
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,219
During the Lantern Festival, weren't you paired up with her!

37
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:12,580
Traveling with a beauty while unable to let go of your beloved wife.

38
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,280
You're a flirt, you don't need Xue Xi.

39
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,779
- But I'm different.
 - Even if you do this,

40
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,840
whether I'm around or not, Xue Xi won't marry you.

41
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,016
For the Xiao family and His Highness's dignity, she hasn't said anything.

42
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,239
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

43
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,380
Even if this marriage can't happen,

44
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,659
there will still be many opportunities to serve His Highness.

45
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,960
But if you anger the Xiao family and anger me,

46
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,659
aren't you afraid of disturbing His Majesty?

47
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,779
Sui Zhi, I have no intention of being your enemy.

48
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:10,700
It's just that I have no means of dealing with Xue Xi.

49
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,460
If you really want to ease Prince Ning's worries,

50
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,199
just lend me a hand and persuade Xue Xi more.

51
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,940
Although Xue Xi seems fragile, she's got a determination.

52
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,140
It' extremely hard for her to turn back after she's made a decision.

53
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,060
I can't control how she chooses a husband.

54
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,024
Forget it.

55
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,040
Thank you for the reminder.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,859
I was muddled today.

57
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,299
Take her away.

58
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,559
Hurry and go! There's a trap!

59
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,460
Jiang Chang Yang! Jiang…

60
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:46,539
Without you, there won't be anything between me and Xue Xi.

61
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:16,076
Young Master, the sword!

62
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,419
Open the secret room!

63
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,699
Even someone as notorious as you has people willing to die for you.

64
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,419
Utterly ridiculous.

65
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:05,059
Open the secret room, or I'll kill you now.

66
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,500
I belong to Prince Ning. Do you dare?

67
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,539
Come on!

68
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,340
Jiang Chang Yang!

69
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,579
This is an imperial sword. Ask yourself if I dare.

70
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,620
Open it!

71
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,220
Mu Dan.

72
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,772
Mu Dan.

73
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,384
Where's the antidote?

74
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:58,020
Even with the antidote, she probably won't survive like this.

75
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,860
If she dies, you'll be buried with her.

76
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,699
The antidote.

77
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:09,079
Quick, go get the antidote.

78
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,550
Yes, Sir.

79
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:24,299
Jiang Chang Yang, so what if you can afford top experts to protect your life?

80
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,939
Do you think those noble ladies dare marry you?

81
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:35,620
Only such lowly merchant women would be willing to go to hell with you.

82
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,360
I won't kill you now,

83
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,279
only because her safety is more important than you.

84
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:50,980
If you dare harm my people again, I'll take your life.

85
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,980
You pretend to be righteous and loyal.

86
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:03,079
How are you better than me?

87
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:10,939
Everyone knows you're full of evil deeds and have enemies everywhere.

88
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:17,500
Someone like you is destined to harm your wife and friends.

89
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,679
Abandoned by all, you'll live a lonely life.

90
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,600
Shut up!

91
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,819
Make way!

92
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,419
How is she?

93
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:08,440
Will this poison leave any residual problems? When will she wake up?

94
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,300
According to Physician Fu's instructions, after acupuncture for three days

95
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,380
the remaining toxins will be removed. It poses no harm to the body.

96
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,059
She should wake up within the next two hours.

97
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,879
You can send someone to prepare some soft and sticky porridge.

98
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,112
Chuan Yu.

99
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:28,299
It was due to my poor handling that Mu Dan was dragged into this.

100
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:32,519
Pei Zhong came for me. I harmed her.

101
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,559
Young Master Liu!

102
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,579
Since you can't protect her, why not let her leave?

103
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,999
- It's all because of you that she's been in so much danger.
 - Enough.

104
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,939
It's all my fault. Please don't blame him.

105
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:48,839
Because of your own confidence, you put my sister in danger.

106
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,299
What did my sister do wrong for her to suffer this unforeseen disaster?

107
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:54,659
Young Master Liu, Mu Dan is fine now.

108
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,048
Calm down.

109
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:59,679
This time she's fine, but what about next time?

110
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,140
I have only one sister left.

111
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,400
I don't want to lose her as well.

112
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:12,479
 Someone like you is destined to harm your wife and friends.

113
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:16,799
 Abandoned by all, you'll live a lonely life.

114
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:57,140
Mu Dan, you're awake.

115
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,340
- Da Fu.
 - Sister.

116
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,168
Young Master Liu.

117
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,896
Be careful.

118
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,659
Where is Jiang Chang Yang?

119
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,492
He's dead.

120
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,080
What did you say?

121
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't listen to his nonsense. He's fine, doing well.

122
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,200
Why isn't he here?

123
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,059
Do you care about him that much?

124
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,880
Only Da Fu and I are here guarding you. Does this disappoint you?

125
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,868
You clearly know…

126
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,640
You know that's not what I meant.

127
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:48,419
Today's situation was critical.

128
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,559
Not seeing him makes me uneasy.

129
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,459
He has you and guards protecting him. What danger could he be in?

130
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,500
Enough, Young Master Liu.

131
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,760
Young Master Jiang is truly fine. He's gone back.

132
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,419
Just now he sent Chuan Yu with food.

133
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:06,679
He also sent donkey hide pudding.

134
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,140
When you encountered danger, were you truly unafraid of death?

135
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,500
Have you ever thought if something happened to you,

136
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,619
me, Da Fu, Xiao Chun, and everyone at Fragrance Garden and Floral Haven,

137
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,659
what would we do?

138
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,900
At that moment, I didn't have time to think so much.

139
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:34,340
I only knew I couldn't let him face any danger.

140
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,659
You're wholeheartedly devoted to Jiang Chang Yang.

141
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,839
What about him? Is he worth such devotion from you?

142
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:49,699
I know you've always been quite biased against him.

143
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,819
But do you know?

144
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:57,419
Whether in Luoyang, the military camp, or Chang'an,

145
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,959
he repeatedly pulled me out of darkness.

146
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:09,380
I don't know if he has ever asked himself if it's worth it for me.

147
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,392
I only know

148
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:18,928
to die for someone who understands you,
you'll have no regrets.

149
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,056
Jiang Chang Yang.

150
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,360
It's late and the dew is heavy. You be resting in bed and recuperating.

151
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,699
I'm just here to test the waters.

152
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,220
If Young Master Liu hurt you, I can't afford to compensate.

153
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,340
We'd have to move overnight.

154
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,360
It was such a nice Lantern Festival.

155
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,380
I almost caused you to miss seeing this full moon.

156
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,279
You don't need to blame yourself. You helped me so much before.

157
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,299
This time, consider it me paying you for your kindness.

158
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,819
I help you because I have the ability to do so.

159
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,220
What about you?

160
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:36,939
What do you mean by that?

161
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,520
Our marriage was a façade, meant for outsiders to see.

162
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,839
It wasn't mutual affection.

163
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,739
There's no need to act as if we're bound by life and death.

164
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,219
From now on, don't take risks for me anymore.

165
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,580
I came to find you, and this is what you say to me?

166
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,900
Jiang Chang Yang, what's wrong with you?

167
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm just scared thinking about today's events.

168
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,856
Mu Dan,

169
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,620
I'm very fortunate to have you as a close friend.

170
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,659
That day in front of Prince Ning, you helped me hide the secret chamber.

171
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm very grateful.

172
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,680
But today you risked your life to save me.

173
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,844
For me...

174
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:25,140
it's a heavy burden.

175
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:31,812
Burden?

176
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:40,300
You're He Wei Fang, the leader of flower merchants.

177
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,780
The owner of Floral Haven.

178
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:45,839
You rely on no one else.

179
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,820
You've created a world of fragrance with your own hands.

180
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,359
You should live freely and unrestrained.

181
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,460
You shouldn't compromise for anything. You certainly shouldn't...

182
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,340
put yourself at risk for anyone.

183
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,950
Yes,

184
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,380
living freely and unrestrained is how I should be.

185
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
You're right.

186
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,780
I've taken your words to heart.

187
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:35,000
From now on, we owe each other nothing, dear friend.

188
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:39,884
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

189
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:43,880
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

190
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,912
 ♫ As if life were a thread ♫

191
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:52,764
 ♫ Ripples arise with the wind ♫

192
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,672
 ♫ The world is full of rugged paths ♫

193
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:01,900
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

194
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,932
 ♫ A thought that does not deceive ♫

195
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:10,416
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

196
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,892
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

197
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:27,540
 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

198
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:34,868
 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

199
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:39,659
 ♫ The flowers bloom and fall, searching with you ♫

200
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:42,839
- Young Master.
 - No need.

201
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,179
Have you thought it through? Are you really going to give up telling her?

202
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,820
It was after this event that I realized something.

203
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm already used to countless dangers.

204
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,699
But how can I ask her to get used to it too?

205
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:13,459
I shouldn't selfishly try to keep her by my side.

206
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,230
All of this,

207
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,650
take it down.

208
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:30,240
I've walked alone through the long night for too long.

209
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,540
I no longer dare to hope to last until sunrise.

210
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,499
Having a distant moon to look at is already a blessing.

211
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:47,279
Why turn this moon into a paper lantern?

212
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,459
If the great enterprise isn't accomplished in the future,

213
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:58,340
it means forcing her to extinguish with me.

214
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,040
But outsiders all believe that Miss He is your beloved concubine.

215
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,000
If you become true lovers, there's no difference from the current situation.

216
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
When this feeling isn't revealed,

217
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:18,150
if another crisis arises,

218
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,380
I can still persuade her to leave as a friend.

219
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,680
If she knows my feelings,

220
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:28,259
with her personality,

221
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,599
no matter the peril she faces, she would never abandon me.

222
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:38,960
I don't fear death,

223
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,050
but I fear...

224
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,100
her dying because of me.

225
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,759
But Young Master, I think…

226
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,200
What about Pei Zhong?

227
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,790
Tell She Yan...

228
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,490
to handle things according to the old rules.

229
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:16,580
The Prince Ning's secret forces in Chang'an are all under Pei Zhong's command.

230
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,440
Following this lead, She Yan can figure out all of Prince Ning's forces.

231
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,459
If Pei Zhong is killed at this time,

232
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:27,300
Prince Ning might appoint someone, making it hard to trace.

233
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,060
The great cause has not yet succeeded. Please think thrice.

234
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,900
We can spare his life,

235
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:43,340
but I must avenge Mu Dan.

236
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,419
A gentleman can wait ten years to seek revenge,

237
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,019
but as the Floral Envoy, I can do it for my own heart's content.

238
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:54,140
Yes.

239
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Let go of me!

240
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:14,540
Jiang Chang Yang, you wretched scoundrel!

241
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,839
Jiang Chang Yang!

242
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,380
He is so reckless.

243
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,720
Not only did he hurt me and insult me, but also spread this all over Chang'an.

244
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,240
Now outsiders all laugh at me.

245
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,128
In this manner,

246
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,820
he shows such disregard for Your Highness.

247
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,259
I request Your Highness to stand up for me.

248
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:43,820
The verdict is based on evidence, not intentions.

249
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,019
He left no evidence behind.

250
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:50,739
How can a judgment be made solely on your words?

251
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:56,300
I saw with my own eyes that the one leading to harm me was his guard.

252
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,219
Aside from you, are there any other witnesses?

253
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:06,900
You plotted to frame him.

254
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,548
Given his disposition, only stabbing you twice and beating you up

255
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:13,739
already shows me great respect.

256
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:18,540
Xue Xi came the day before yesterday.

257
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,000
Guess what she said to me.

258
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,939
I don't know.

259
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,259
You two vied for her favor,

260
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,599
but Xue Xi was constantly defending Jiang Chang Yang.

261
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:41,340
In the matter of winning a lady's favor, you really ought to learn from him.

262
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,940
- Your Highness, Jiang Chang Yang's profligate ways…
 - Just admit defeat.

263
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,459
If grace remains, perhaps you can somehow get the upper hand.

264
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:54,960
Xue Xi's inclinations aren't important.

265
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:02,900
What is important is to not neglect the Xiao family.

266
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,436
Yes.

267
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,950

268
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,300

269
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,140
Mu Dan! Mu Dan!

270
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,699
What's wrong?

271
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,399
It's been hard to wait for the reopening of the voyage.

272
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,659
But our merchant ships heading south have all been intercepted.

273
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,380
- Why?
 - I went around to inquire.

274
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,760
The people at the dock were all polite, but they all hesitated.

275
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,620
They said it was orders from the higher-ups.

276
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,540
What is your purpose in intercepting my merchant ships?

277
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,419
Today, I was promoted and the "deputy" removed from my title.

278
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,520
And today,

279
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,140
nothing much.

280
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:00,419
I just wanted to see you.

281
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,699
Accompany me for a drink and watch the sunset for a while.

282
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:09,100
Tomorrow your merchant ships can surely leave the port.

283
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,000
My merchant ships don't have to only go down this water route.

284
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,419
I hope you'll let me take the goods away.

285
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:24,340
My shop is very busy. Forgive me for not accompanying you.

286
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:34,380
Take this. It'll allow your ships to pass unimpeded.

287
00:28:55,499 --> 00:29:00,159
Today, I only want you to accompany me for a while, just a while.

288
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,060
Do you have to avoid me so quickly?

289
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,060
Even when I avoid you,

290
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,040
my place was set on fire and my house raided.

291
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,280
If you pester me, wouldn't I be left with no life?

292
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,040
That's because you belong to Jiang Chang Yang.

293
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,380
He competes jealously with Pei Zhong, yet got you poisned and in danger.

294
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:25,259
If you stay with such a playboy, your future days won't be peaceful.

295
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,079
I heard for those with broken legs, the cold is the hardest to endure.

296
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,140
You're burning two fire pits.

297
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,540
It seems the old injury still hurts, doesn't it?

298
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,879
Don't forget you're Prince Ning's son-in-law.

299
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,160
Prince Ning is wise and tolerant.

300
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,060
If you can be of use to him,

301
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,219
you can traverse all the nation's trade routes freely.

302
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:07,820
In less than three years, Floral Haven will surely spread throughout the lands.

303
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:14,219
After all this talking, you force me to reveal myself just for money.

304
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,739
Why do you have to pretend here?

305
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,280
To the outside, I endure humiliation for the greater good.

306
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,540
That's to clear away obstacles for our future.

307
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,559
Before you, I never pretend.

308
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,060
Don't you like peonies?

309
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:46,560
When Floral Haven has spread across the world,

310
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,179
we'll spend the winter in the south.

311
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:56,380
I can always ensure peonies surround you.

312
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:10,359
Liu Chang, you really make me laugh.

313
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,699
Before, you and I were at daggers drawn.

314
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:15,839
Now, you're pretending to be affectionate here.

315
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,559
Your persistence is nothing more than for your own ambitions.

316
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,939
For your own selfish desires.

317
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:24,459
This isn't love at all.

318
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,912
This isn't love?

319
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:34,459
When I learned that you were going to marry Jiang Chang Yang,

320
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,699
I was like a puddle of mud,

321
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:39,680
imprisoned in that filthy dungeon.

322
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,820
My heartache then far exceeded the pain of this broken leg.

323
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,300
Isn't this called love?

324
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,540
Do you know what love is?

325
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,659
True love is to love what they love and feel the pain they feel.

326
00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:58,699
Fulfillment isn't confinement.

327
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,060
A heart full of love shouldn't be a sword that hurts people.

328
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,480
It's the bright moon, quietly guarding, enduring forever.

329
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,540
- Do you truly love Jiang Chang Yang?
 - Yes.

330
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,404
Impossible!

331
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Jiang Chang Yang is corrupt and lawless, wild and unruly.

332
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,739
How could he win your heart?

333
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,559
I didn't understand what love was before.

334
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:37,019
It was Jiang Chang Yang who made me understand what it means to love someone.

335
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:40,499
And you, are quite the opposite.

336
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,259
You ignored the County Princess, pestering me repeatedly.

337
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,179
This made her jealous and set Fragrance Garden ablaze.

338
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,760
You were the one who hurt everyone.

339
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,499
Liu Chang, I'm married to the one I love.

340
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:00,759
There has long been nothing between us.

341
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,419
Treat the County Princess well and don't persist anymore.

342
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,240
Nothing between us?

343
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:18,412
What are you doing?

344
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,830
Go away!

345
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,240
Don't come over!

346
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:28,839
You loathe me this much?

347
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,392
Give it to me.

348
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,264
Don't hurt yourself.

349
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,879
You're overthinking it.

350
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:44,659
How could I hurt myself over someone like you?

351
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,984
Don't move.

352
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:54,839
Liu Chang, I'm warning you for the last time.

353
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,359
In the future, if you dare hurt me or those I love again,

354
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,760
I will surely point my sword at you and fight you to the death.

355
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,139
Why did you come back so late?

356
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,499
Today is your birthday.

357
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,079
Why did you go drinking alone?

358
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,380
The night is beautiful. How about I accompany you for a few more drinks?

359
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,960
You put down your pride

360
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,080
just to spend a birthday with the one you love.

361
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:42,280
But things didn't go as you wished.

362
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,900
He just doesn't have you in his heart.

363
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,340
Why go through so much trouble?

364
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,079
On your birthday, you got promoted.

365
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,660
I prepared this jade crown as a celebration gift.

366
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,820
Do you want to try it, Zi Shu?

367
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:37,128
No need.

368
00:36:46,459 --> 00:36:48,900
If you don't like it, just tell me and I'll take it away.

369
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Why destroy it in front of me?

370
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:10,360
Pursuing without success, yet persisting relentlessly.

371
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,360
We're the same.

372
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:49,292
It's pathetic.

373
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:07,140

374
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,404
Did Liu Chang hurt you?

375
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,230

376
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,600
Young Master Jiang, you mobilized such a large force.

377
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,419
If I had returned any later,

378
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:50,820
you might have taken up your sword to go on a killing spree, right?

379
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,780
Aren't you afraid that Prince Ning and the Princess will turn against you?

380
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,059
If I did go, I would've prepared excuses.

381
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,280
It wouldn't reach Prince Ning's ears.

382
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,619
Indeed, you've thought it through.

383
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:11,720
But why do you need to go to such lengths for a mere friend?

384
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,320
- Doesn't this harm your reputation as the Floral Envoy?
 - I…

385
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,696
Liu Chang took over the river transport.

386
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,740
Not only your ships,

387
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,160
any trade that cannot benefit Prince Ning will be obstructed.

388
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,099
But those ships that sail smoothly

389
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,860
are all involved in smuggling valuable artifacts and reselling tributes.

390
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,400
Liu Chang's control has already incited much dissatisfaction.

391
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:43,740
I'm worried that you might be implicated by him.

392
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm not someone who maintains lingering attachments.

393
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,139
Today, I met Liu Chang and made clear what needed to be said.

394
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:02,979
All inappropriate delusions have been severed.

395
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,880
Please rest assured, Young Master Jiang.

396
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,452
That's good.

397
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,099
Since I am the owner of Floral Haven,

398
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,579
I'll resolve any issues that arise within this shop.

399
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:24,839
And it should rightfully be resolved by myself.

400
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,340
I hope you can trust my ability

401
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,019
and stop worrying about my affairs.

402
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,039
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving first, dear friend.

403
00:41:08,459 --> 00:41:11,760
Young Master, why don't you tell Young Madam

404
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,900
that Liu Chang will be eliminated in three days

405
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,260
and that her merchant ships will sail unimpeded thereafter.

406
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,839
She would be delighted,

407
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,260
and perhaps she won't be so cold towards you.

408
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:27,059
I asked for it, so I must endure it.

409
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:30,399
You don't need to mention it in front of her.

410
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:35,104
Yes.

411
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:49,990
