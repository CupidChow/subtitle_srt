13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hengtong, Xiaochun is a talented doctor.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Even the deputy chief of the medical department praised her.

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you force her to stay at home and force her to marry and have children,

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm afraid she will suffer for the rest of her life.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Marrying is the right way for a woman.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm doing this for her own good,

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to find a good family for her.

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you?

22
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're making a mess and pushing her into the fire pit.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Leave!

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't see our Chun'er again!

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Send her off!

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's my idea to change the doctor.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It has nothing to do with others.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Master, the clothes from the Hu family were smashed by my wife.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can't stop her.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You were gentle and gentle before.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How could you be like this?

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Zhiyan, that's my nature.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I was afraid you would be sad, so I pretended to be gentle.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Father, I don't want to get married.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to continue my medical career.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not only your fault that you're a woman.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
People will look down on you.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't you want to get married?

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I'm a woman, I'm not worthy of a family.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're talking nonsense.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If your mother sees you like this,

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
she won't be able to understand you.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to ask you this.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Isn't your mother a good person?

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where is her husband?

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She only has you.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She's a woman with a family.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She's been living in a house for a lifetime.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're a woman!

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you know what her true love is?

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you know what her dream is?

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Father has lost his mother.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is he going to lose his daughter again?

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I...

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can only love me once.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is it only possible because you're a woman?

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can't you do what you love?

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you too stubborn?

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Xiaochun is a shrew.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The whole family has been looking down on her.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The patients she treated are more respected.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's true that we hid your true love.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But there's no fault in your medical career.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,400
But Xiaochun is a doctor. She's not wrong.

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
He Dianzhu, you're a traitor!

67
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,400
You're a traitor!

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,800
I can't let my daughter go your way!

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
Father.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,520
Chun'er, you've grown up.

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,640
You've made friends and have a family. Don't you need this family?

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,920
I'll ask you one last time.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,640
You want to stay and be my daughter?

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,440
Or you want to break out of this door and follow your so-called path?

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Can't I?

76
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,640
You can't.

77
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,280
Okay, I'll go.

78
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Don't ever worry about anything in the future.

79
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,440
I'll see you tomorrow then.

80
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,480
Don't ever forget my call.

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Believe me.

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,480
I'd like to take a long time with my daughter.

83
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,960
Are you any kind of daughter?

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,760
No, I'm just a young daughter.

85
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Father once said that Pugong should leave with the wind and leave the house.

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,760
It's just because I like it, so I planted it.

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,760
But he didn't know that I didn't take it seriously.

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,760
I planted it to wait for the flowers to fall and then to pick roots and soak them in water.

89
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,760
To cure his throat pain.

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I didn't know that Pugong was so good.

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,760
But now he's so depressed that he's really gone.

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Your father is so stubborn because he cares about you so much.

93
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Xiaochun, you should go to Fang Yuan to live with your father for a few days.

94
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Let him think about it.

95
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Yes, when the rain stops, I'll go to Fang Yuan.

96
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,760
He doesn't want to leave you.

97
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,760
I don't know what to do.

98
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
I've never seen a six-sail boat ride.

99
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,760
I want to take him to see it.

100
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Of course not.

101
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Six-sail doesn't ride a horse, does it?

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Do you want to go with me to the city and enjoy the beautiful spring in Chang'an?

103
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Six-sail is always on your side. I don't know where I've offended you.

104
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
What's wrong?

105
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,760
The flower girl didn't let me get on the bike. She sent me to ride a horse.

106
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,760
She thinks I'm sick and afraid of getting sick.

107
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,760
But I can't ride that high horse. If I fall,

108
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll be a six-sail with a beautiful face.

109
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,760
You can laugh at me, but it's not right to hurt you.

110
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,760
If you want to ride with me, just say it.

111
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Why are you lying and slandering others?

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
It's not a right thing for a pure gentleman.

113
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Six-sail is wrong.

114
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,760
If you're wrong, apologize to your brother-in-law.

115
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm sorry. Six-sail won't be like this again.

116
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
It doesn't matter.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Six-sail won't go to the pier today.

118
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Sister, you...

119
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Sister and brother-in-law should leave. Don't waste time.

120
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Okay, since I promised you, I won't break my promise.

121
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll go with Chuan Yu.

122
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Get on the bike.

123
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Your sister is always like this.

124
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
She's always being polite. I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
You should ride with us.

126
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
It's okay.

127
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
It's okay.

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Let's go.

129
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Let's go.

130
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Let's go.

131
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Let's go.

132
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
It's okay.

133
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,580
Penaltyım var.

134
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,600
Zhulang, look.

135
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,260
There's thehabaishops.

136
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,460
Come and have a look?

137
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,400
This price is not enough.

138
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,460
Pray, let it be.

139
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,900
Got it.

140
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,640
An Ambassador is humble.

141
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,860
I will not go with someone like you.

142
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
It must not be.

143
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,680
So voters wanted this.

144
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,280
Why are you selling them here?

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,280
You need to move out.

146
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,960
Can you organize things elsewhere?

147
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,200
I've got a

148
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
time widow.

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
I understand.

150
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Fine.

151
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
Liang, let's go play.

152
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280
Give me the stuff.

153
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Let's go!

154
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,680
Have fun!

155
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,560
Mr. Meng,

156
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,380
you didn't racing

157
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
What's wrong?

158
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
He's a sensitive person.

159
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,040
He's a bit biased.

160
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
I know all his tricks.

161
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,560
But I believe that

162
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,320
you can do it if you're careful.

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,160
We're family.

164
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,640
We should be tolerant.

165
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,160
Why do you have to argue with a kid?

166
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Okay, okay.

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,960
Your good brother.

168
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,760
I'll be more patient in the future.

169
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I'll be more careful.

170
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
You said that

171
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
the boatman was the first to come here.

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,280
Now the letter says

173
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
the boatman is coming.

174
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,720
I wonder who he is.

175
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,920
I wonder if he'll like the gifts I brought.

176
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,400
Move, move, move.

177
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,640
Move, move, move.

178
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Move, move, move.

179
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
Move, move, move.

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,920
What are you looking at?

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
The glory of the world.

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
The owner.

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I'll go in.

184
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
This way, please.

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
This way.

186
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,880
Hello?

187
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,260
Mr. Zhaoyun, what do you mean?

188
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,600
My husband is waiting outside waiting for you.

189
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,100
If he sees you still standing,

190
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,220
he'll be furious.

191
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,260
I don't know about your personality.

192
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,640
If I know something,

193
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,080
I'll take you with me every time.

194
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
It's not his turn yet.

195
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,420
Here we are.

196
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,840
You're not getting out of this too fast.

197
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
Huh?

198
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,060
Oh, it's not too late.

199
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,500
Have you done your garbage job?

200
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,660
I've been looking all over the place.

201
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Just drink some tea and talk business.

202
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,340
We will give it to Dragon King Mao.

203
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,400
Who is the King?

204
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
The ship can't even stand on the ship.

205
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
How can they build such a big ship?

206
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
It's snowing in winter. The dock is shaking.

207
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
The ship's owner told me that

208
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
the rules of the ship are that

209
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
every year when the ship is refueled,

210
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,400
the first piece of ice will be stored in the ship.

211
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
It's easy to live until the new year.

212
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
The wind is calm and the waves are quiet.

213
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Everything is smooth.

214
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I don't believe it.

215
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
But when I think of seeing you today,

216
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
I want to ask for a favor.

217
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,400
What do you want from me today?

218
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
It's been a long time since I saw you.

219
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Let's talk about business.

220
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I've made up my mind after I got married.

221
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I want to do business well and make a good fortune.

222
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Then I'll see you in person.

223
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
These days I've decided to work with you.

224
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I want to build a ship and sell it.

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I want to get the people's attention.

226
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
It's because of you that I've decided to build this dock.

227
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I'll sell it to the merchant and the merchant's family.

228
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
The merchant's family will be rich and the people will be rich.

229
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Now I have your help.

230
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Congratulations on your dream.

231
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
But these achievements have nothing to do with me.

232
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
But for you, it's not easy.

233
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I hope you can transfer to the vice-principal.

234
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'll tell you something about you.

235
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
If you're here, you can get rid of the tax.

236
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
And you can go out of the ship.

237
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Thank you, but I can't.

238
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I hope you can transfer to the vice-principal.

239
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll be with the other merchants.

240
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I'll be with you.

241
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I'll be with you.

242
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You're still the same He Weifang.

243
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
But I'm no longer the same.

244
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Now I have patience for what I want.

245
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll go with you to the next peace.

246
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
We'll have tea and drink.

247
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I can't be your husband.

248
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,400
But I want to be with you forever.

249
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:29,420
The nasty creature can't endure my

250
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
To put it sprinkled to them

251
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,260
there is nothing like secret

252
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,360
that is said to be 있어서

253
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,860
In order to not prevent their

254
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Come we would like to

255
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,520
Replace

256
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,080
Yes

257
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,680
today you are busy

258
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,280
again here

259
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
I don't have any other purpose.

260
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm your husband.

261
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I have to take good care of you.

262
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
You know it's her.

263
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

264
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
I only know that she built this pier.

265
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Who would have thought that she, the transfer assistant,

266
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
would disguise herself as a ship's captain and meet someone else's wife?

267
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Don't talk nonsense.

268
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
I didn't meet her.

269
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm just talking to her.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm here to talk business.

271
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
You didn't send me any gifts.

272
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
It seems that you're not in a good mood.

273
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,280
I happened to encounter this thing in the market.

274
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
I heard that this bracelet can shine in the light.

275
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
It will make you look rich in the daytime and look good in the night.

276
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,280
It will also make you look more beautiful in the night.

277
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
This is a good thing.

278
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Isn't this a very useful thing?

279
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
It can be used to make a fortune.

280
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
This is a good thing.

281
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
The only thing that's in the mind of the shopkeeper is business.

282
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
You were on the ship just now...

283
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
I saw that the fruit wasn't ripe.

284
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
I'm glad I didn't eat it.

285
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
It's so sour.

286
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
He Weifang, no one told me to try the poison.

287
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
You...

288
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Mr. Long, the shopkeepers are grateful to you.

289
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
They sent you a batch of tea.

290
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I'll make a new one for you.

291
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,280
The shopkeeper ordered that he should go to the market in the port.

292
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Then he went to the Taoguang Courtyard.

293
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
He had two fox cakes and a bowl of soup for dinner.

294
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
He also ate cherry tomatoes after dinner.

295
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Cherry tomatoes?

296
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
He never ate fruits.

297
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,560
And she ate a lot.

298
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,440
Maybe this year's cherry is big and sweet.

299
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,080
And you want to taste it.

300
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,640
But I know.

301
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
She is stubborn.

302
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,800
She has no change in her heart.

303
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Why did she change her taste?

304
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,440
When Zi Shu falls asleep,

305
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,840
call the people who followed her today.

306
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
I want to interrogate.

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes.

308
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,760
What do you want?

309
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,800
Go.

310
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
Your automated phonetic disciplinary 750,

311
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,160
why does it still speak?

312
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,040
It blasts.

313
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
Family commentator directs her.

314
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Who is it?

315
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I don't dare to do it.

316
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Is it incompetence or unwillingness to do it?

317
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I dare not.

318
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Your Highness, I heard that the head of the gang, the lover, was provoked by He Weifang to leave home.

319
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Moreover, he was thrown into the shop and was given a disease.

320
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
He Weifang treated the Lü family so well, the head of the gang could bear it.

321
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm afraid it's really incompetence.

322
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
The head of the gang, the lover, was thrown into the shop and was given a disease.

323
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
He Weifang was thrown into the shop and was given a disease.

324
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm afraid it's really incompetence.

325
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I dare not.

326
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I dare not.

327
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
I dare not.

328
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I dare not.

329
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I dare not.

330
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I dare not.

331
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
I dare not.

332
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I dare not.

333
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:38,600
If the flower is still there, the Lü family will not exist.

334
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
My Lady!

335
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
My Lady!

336
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
My Lady!

337
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Who is so rude?

338
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
The county magistrate's carriage is so bold.

339
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm a man of the flower shop.

340
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
I'm willing to share my worries with you.

341
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Go and make the arrangements.

342
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Be careful.

343
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Don't be a fool.

344
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Don't be a fool.

345
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
I understand.

346
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,600
After this, the gang will be in trouble.

347
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
I have a broken leg.

348
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
But I will not let you go.

349
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm so tired.

350
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Mudan?

351
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Alien?

352
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Why are you here again?

353
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Change the system.

354
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Alien.

355
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Change the system.

356
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I'm so tired.

357
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm going to the store to buy some water.

358
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Alien.

359
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Change the system.

360
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm so tired.

361
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm going to the store to buy some water.

362
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm so tired.

363
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm going to the store to buy some water.

364
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Alien.

365
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
There is also a toilet water.

366
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
It is 100% toilet water.

367
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Bryan.

368
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Everyone is here.

369
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Because such a woman has suffered several visits too.

370
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Today we must take revenge.

371
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
All you can do is Vehicle instinct.

372
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Everybody takeaways alone.

373
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
If you agree to me.

374
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
누가 или что

375
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I've never lost a hundred grams of Yun Bin Nan.

376
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I've never lost ten.

377
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I've been selling it for five times.

378
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
It's a good match with Yun Bin Nan.

379
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
There will be no problems.

380
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
There must be other reasons.

381
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You're a woman of no use.

382
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
You're just being fooled by He Wei Fang.

383
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Don't make another mistake.

384
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,600
The real culprit is He Wei Fang.

385
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Come out, He Wei Fang!

386
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,600
The culprit of the victim is He Wei Fang.

387
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
There's no problem with the electric current.

388
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I have evidence.

389
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Everyone, I sell medicine for the sake of the people.

390
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I must be careful.

391
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Therefore, every batch of medicine in this book will be taken from the store.

392
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Yes, this is the sample of the drug dealer.

393
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
The store has a date of the stock.

394
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
The seal on the box proves that I've never touched it.

395
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I'll give this box to the government to check.

396
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
This proves that there's no problem with the drug dealer.

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
The death of the Wu family has nothing to do with the Qing Shu village.

398
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
He's asking for the drug.

399
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
He should be honest.

400
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Mr. He, what's the point of pointing out the drug?

401
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Mr. He, It's good medicine.

402
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
One could still cure a person's death by it.

403
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
The representative of Wu family did this.

404
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,000
It proves that the ancient《Wu》破裂子

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
has been제를 proven wrong.

406
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Well, based on the previous record,

407
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
He would have just bought thera?

408
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
It is!

409
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
People, do you believe inıyıo diaobao

410
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
or inyi cheese!

411
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
You can't kill me!

412
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
No!

413
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Your Highness!

414
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
This is the medicine for the murder!

415
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
The medicine for the murder!

416
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Don't hit me!

417
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
You can't go to Mount Qingchun!

418
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Take her away!

419
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Go!

420
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
What are you doing?

421
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Go!

422
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
This is not related to the Qingchun family!

423
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
This is our fault!

424
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Go!

425
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Don't cry, Xiaochun.

426
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
It's okay.

427
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Don't worry.

428
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
I've got you into trouble today.

429
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm sorry.

430
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
If you hadn't helped me open the book store,

431
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Cao Yun would not have found this medicine.

432
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,600
I just don't know who is behind it.

433
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
You've finally confessed your love.

434
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
You'll find out sooner or later.

435
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,600
What's most important now is how we prove our innocence.

436
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
If I can get close to the Wu family,

437
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I can know that she died of a heart attack.

438
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
But now she's trapped here.

439
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I can't do anything.

440
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
I don't know if Father heard about this.

441
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Will he be worried?

442
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
They say that when people are in trouble,

443
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
the first one to think of is the person they care about the most.

444
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You were angry with Father before.

445
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,600
But now you care about him the most.

446
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Don't cry.

447
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
When we're done,

448
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
go home and tell him.

449
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Don't cry.

450
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Change the incense.

451
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Thank you, sir.

452
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Father.

453
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Go.

454
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Chun'er.

455
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Father.

456
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Why are you so hurt?

457
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
It's all Mudan who's protecting me.

458
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Otherwise, I would...

459
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
If you had listened to me and stayed home and married,

460
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

461
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You're the one who's protecting me.

462
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
I'm very grateful.

463
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
But you women are injured.

464
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
You've caused trouble.

465
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Do you think I'm the one who's killed you?

466
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
It doesn't matter.

467
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Saving you is the most important thing.

468
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
It's important?

469
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
You're talking to me?

470
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
I'm not talking to you.

471
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm talking to you.

472
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
It's important.

473
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
It's the most important thing to me.

474
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,600
I didn't cause trouble.

475
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Someone framed me.

476
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
I've studied the prescription for months.

477
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Hundreds of people took it.

478
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
None of them is wrong.

479
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
All the patients who didn't see the truth

480
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
are willing to believe my medical skills.

481
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Why don't you believe me?

482
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You're my father.

483
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Chun'er.

484
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Hengtong.

485
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
I'm not angry with Xiaochun.

486
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
It's because of me.

487
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I've got her involved.

488
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,600
I'll find a way to prove her innocence.

489
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,600
The key to this case is that the prescription is correct.

490
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
You've already done this.

491
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
How can you prove her innocence?

492
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I told you not to push her into the fire.

493
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
Women doctors will always be in the wrong.

494
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm not going to do it.

495
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,600
If you think I'm the reason for the trouble,

496
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
and humiliate the Lü family,

497
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I won't have a daughter.

498
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Please go back.

499
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
You're still so stubborn.

500
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Do you want to die in prison?

501
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Hengtong.

502
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
She was so cruel that she let Xiaochun

503
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
take the charge of murder.

504
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,600
She's not going to get out of prison?

505
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Calm down.

506
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
If we really killed the sorcerer,

507
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
why didn't the county council discuss it?

508
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Why did they fight against the law

509
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,600
and use their own hearts to make us confess?

510
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,600
We have to investigate all of this

511
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
to prove Xiaochun's innocence.

512
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Go!

513
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,600
It's really night.

514
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Jia Changyang didn't lie to me.

515
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
When you're in trouble,

516
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,600
the first person you think of is you.

517
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Xiaochun's father came in.

518
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,600
He wanted to make a wish.

519
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,600
And you came in so easily.

520
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
You're a good bird.

521
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
The case is not over yet.

522
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
They dared to torture you.

523
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
They're going to kill you.

524
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
You're going to die.

525
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
You're going to die.

526
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
You're going to die.

527
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
They're going to kill you.

528
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
They dare to torture you.

529
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Who ordered it?

530
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,600
If Chang'an could stop this day,

531
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
and frame me for this crime,

532
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
and ignore your face,

533
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,600
who else would torture me?

534
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Of course, only that one.

535
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
You shouldn't leave me.

536
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
No, I can't.

537
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
I'm going to leave with you.

538
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Otherwise, won't it make a number of more problems than others

539
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
when I care about the killing of cooking?

540
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
With someone else behind all this,

541
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
no one can say anything.

542
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,600
I have to investigate it more precisely

543
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
I want Cao Yuning to watch the county magistrate,

544
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,600
and the people in the city to watch the people behind him.

545
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Xiaochun and I must walk out of this old house,

546
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
with all our hearts and souls.

547
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Okay.

548
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
But if anything happens to Ai,

549
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
if you don't do anything as a husband,

550
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
you can't do it.

551
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
You must be very sad.

552
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
If there's anything I can help you with,

553
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
please do.

554
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Thank you for your kindness.

555
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Although I can't walk out of this old house,

556
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I've already calculated all the events of the investigation.

557
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Please help me with the purification.

558
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
How did you know about this?

559
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
How is it?

560
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
General Jiang,

561
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
the martial arts was produced before.

562
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
The death of Chiqi was not a long-term need.

563
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
It was a good time to recuperate.

564
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
A lot of cold-toxic substances were used.

565
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
So that the fallen red forest was not enough,

566
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
and the blood was drained and died.

567
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
I'm afraid that the martial arts are being sold,

568
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
and the people are being investigated.

569
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
But I haven't found out the truth.

570
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Why is that?

571
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Most of the martial arts are men.

572
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
The symptoms of the disease are usually common.

573
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Many women are sick and are ashamed of their former doctors.

574
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
The female patients they've seen

575
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
are not as many as our female doctors.

576
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
It's normal for them to have some kind of hidden features.

577
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
No wonder Mudan asked me to give the imperial concubine a message

578
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
to tell her to find a female doctor.

579
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Yun Bindan is a gentle and kind person.

580
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
He is not a bad person.

581
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
The martial arts must have taken his stuff.

582
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I see.

583
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Thank you, doctor.

584
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Please come back to the palace and thank the concubine for me.

585
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Thank you, doctor.

586
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Thank you.

587
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Father.

588
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I've put together all documents and evidence

589
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
according to your instructions.

590
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Master Tang found out from the gardener

591
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
that the female doctor was Cao Yuying's mistress.

592
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
She's been hiding under the nail.

593
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,600
and a doctor who claimed that his concubine had just given birth to a baby.

594
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,600
He found a pharmacy and bought some

595
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
ingredients for the baby.

596
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Someone saw Cao Ying taking a crab, a bullfrog,

597
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
and went to the Wu family.

598
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
The next day, he was told that he was dead.

599
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
The doctor had already got the testimony of the parties

600
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
and bought the evidence of the pharmacy.

601
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
He was also in the kitchen of the Wu family and found food.

602
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
When he goes to the court, the young lady will definitely be able to clear the wrongs.

603
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Don't worry, sir.

604
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
To ensure that there is no more fish after death,

605
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,600
I have to go to the meeting.

606
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Why are you free today?

607
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Why did you come to my house?

608
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
These days, my concubine has been seduced by someone

609
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
and is in prison.

610
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I was so angry that I went to the county office and made a scene.

611
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
But I accidentally found food at home.

612
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
So I came to return it.

613
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
So the bird-catcher came to ask for forgiveness.

614
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
He Weifang made me fall off the horse.

615
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
I didn't kill him.

616
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
You are kind.

617
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
The county chief was tempted by someone.

618
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
He was really tempted by someone.

619
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
But he couldn't pay the tax.

620
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Now the county chief is willing to marry the new lover.

621
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
The king has also sought justice for you.

622
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
He has made Zi Shu brother transfer to the new wife.

623
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Now he is as good as a new wife.

624
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
The king has more useful people.

625
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
He can be used by everyone.

626
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Why are you holding me back?

627
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm not letting go.

628
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Why are you holding me back?

629
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
The justice father has sought for me

630
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
can't be compensated by my heartache.

631
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
I don't dare to say

632
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
whether it can be compensated.

633
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
But since the king agreed to me,

634
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
I have no regrets.

635
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
If the county chief insists on returning the concubine,

636
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
I will not hesitate to be a scoundrel.

637
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,600
I will go to the saint and make a scene.

638
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
The official decree will be given

639
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
and I will accept it.

640
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
What do you want?

641
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
The county chief was tempted by someone.

642
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
I don't like the bad feelings in the jade.

643
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
In my opinion,

644
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
even if this matter is settled,

645
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
the queen and I are still family.

646
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
But the county chief and Zi Shu

647
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
are less in touch with my husband and wife.

648
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
In case they get hurt.

649
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
After all, for the county chief,

650
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
the harmony of husband and wife is the most important.

651
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
What do you think?

652
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
I agree with the words of the flower bird.

653
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
It is not easy to recover the lost.

654
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
If you are not careful,

655
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
you will lose it again.

656
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I hope you cherish it.

657
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
The county chief,

658
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
is the king really going to let He Weifang go?

659
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Jiang Changyang is so fond of He Shi.

660
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
But he is not interested in Zi Shu.

661
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,600
In my opinion,

662
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Zi Shu is also not interested in He Weifang.

663
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
I think it is a good opportunity.

664
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Forget it.

665
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Yes.

666
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
What about Cao Yueying?

667
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Don't worry, my lady.

668
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
She is still a family member.

669
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
She will take the punishment herself.

670
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
She will not be punished.

671
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
I will take care of everything.

672
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
My husband will not know anything.

673
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,600
Cao Yueying poisoned the people.

674
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
She framed someone else.

675
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
The evidence is confirmed.

676
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
The case will be executed in autumn.

677
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Please tell the county chief and the owner

678
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
that they are not guilty.

679
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Release them immediately.

680
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Good!

681
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Good!

682
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
You are so great!

683
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,600
You are so great!

684
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Good!

685
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
The End

686
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
The End

687
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
The End

688
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
The End

689
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,600
The End

690
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
The End

691
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
The End
