3
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,990

4
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,380
This piece is your specialty, how did you play the wrong note?

5
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,659
Is it your skills have dulled or is your heart burdened?

6
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,420
Have your skills dulled or is something on your mind?

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,039
Sui Zhi, don't worry. It's important to enjoy ourselves today.

8
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,180
If anything in your residence is damaged, I'll compensate you twice over.

9
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,119
I'm not worried about inanimate objects, but I'm afraid it might scare my pet deer.

10
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,420
Zi Shu isn't someone with poor judgment.

11
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,519
He knows what to touch and what not to.

12
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,380
Your Majesty,

13
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,080
could it be that you've given Sui Zhi some extraordinary treasure I don't know about?

14
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,180
Your words overwhelm me, Your Highness.

15
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,080
When has His Majesty ever forgotten you when there are good things to share?

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,819
The downside of this large residence is it takes forever to fetch wine.

17
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,719
Sui Zhi, once the wine arrives, you must punish yourself with three cups.

18
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,379
Yes.

19
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:50,300
Your Highness went through such trouble, so I have to drink to my heart's content.

20
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Sui Zhi, with your great capacity for wine, don't pretend to be drunk to fool me.

21
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:03,999
It seems the wine has been found.

22
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,279
How did you end up knocking down his wall looking for wine?

23
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,260
If not for this,

24
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,879
how could we know those closest to us have a hidden side?

25
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,719
- Zi Shu.
 - Yes.

26
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,299
People have many desires, I do have a side I don't wish to share with others.

27
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:04,979
Could Your Highness do me another favor?

28
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,779
Sui Zhi, you seem nervous. It seems this secret room has many mysteries.

29
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,940
Sui Zhi, you're a close minister to His Majesty.

30
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,299
For the sake of his safety, I can't fulfill your wish.

31
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,650
Furthermore, Your Majesty

32
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,920
isn't worried about what might be hidden below?

33
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:49,460
Sui Zhi has been by my side since he was young.

34
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,299
We eat at the same table and travel together.

35
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:57,480
If I can't trust him, who can I trust?

36
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:01,820
Everyone has their secrets. Why must you expose them, Brother?

37
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,859
Your Majesty is magnanimous,

38
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:09,800
but I must fulfill my duty to protect you against even the slightest thing.

39
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,479
- Zi Shu.
 - Yes.

40
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,760
Your Majesty, please.

41
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:46,150

42
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,119
Well, well, Sui Zhi, you've hidden quite a treasure here.

43
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:56,319
It's even more vibrant and aromatic than my harem.

44
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,059
It's a place of romance and bedroom secrets.

45
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,299
It isn't a sight for others, but since His Majesty and Highness have spoken,

46
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,419
I have no choice but to comply.

47
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,319
Now that everyone has seen it, I hope you're satisfied.

48
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,840
As the ancients said, food and sex are the great desires of people.

49
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,679
Sui Zhi, there's no need to feel ashamed or concerned.

50
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,960
Zi Shu, what have you found now?

51
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:47,299
These are rare treasures gathered from various places.

52
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,659
If you like it, I can give you one or two.

53
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,579
But I forgot your legs aren't well, it might be hard for you to do.

54
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,479
Who wants to look at these filthy things!

55
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,539
Why are you so angry?

56
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,279
Did you remember that scandal at Liu Mansion when you saw this sheer curtain?

57
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,500
- You…
 - Sui Zhi.

58
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,980
I'm not bringing this up to disrespect you, Your Highness.

59
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,640
Liu Chang has truly gone too far.

60
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,860
The County Princess burned my beloved concubine's garden,

61
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,100
and now Deputy Liu dismantled my house under false pretense.

62
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,280
This secret room was set up behind Mu Dan's back and can't be hidden anymore.

63
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,279
Do you want to see my household in chaos and take advantage of the situation?

64
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,980
Your Highness, I have no such intention.

65
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,579
It's easy to say, but look at what you've done.

66
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,140
If His Highness insists on partiality, may His Majesty intercede for me.

67
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,539
Liu Chang went too far in this matter.

68
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,459
How can you be so reckless when visiting someone's mansion?

69
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:50,620
Brother, you mustn't be partial.

70
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,579
His Majesty is right. Today was all a misunderstanding.

71
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,579
My people acted rashly, and they deserve to be punished.

72
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,900
Zi Shu, hurry and apologize to Sui Zhi.

73
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,699
It was my reckless behavior and lack of consideration.

74
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,380
I'll punish myself to drink three cups and hope the Floral Envoy can forgive me.

75
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,520
I dare not drink your wine.

76
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,900
You married into Prince Ning's Mansion, but still covet my concubine.

77
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,640
If not for His Highness' sake, I would've broken your other leg long ago.

78
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:41,699
Your Highness, you used to treat me with confidence and trust.

79
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,200
Why did you start doubting me after Liu Chang married in?

80
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,919
Is it that I'm not sincere, or does he have ulterior motives?

81
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,580
Now that my private asset has been checked and secret room searched,

82
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,500
if there's anything else you're worried about, why not deal with it all together?

83
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,100
So I won't be worried in the future, not knowing how to place myself.

84
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,840
Sui Zhi, quickly get up. Get up.

85
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,230
What are you talking about?

86
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,699
Today's events were all done by Zi Shu on his own.

87
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:19,579
Sui Zhi, you're like family to me. How could I suspect you?

88
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:24,740
I believe that this matter wasn't ordered by my brother.

89
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,380
Since the misunderstanding is cleared, why are we still standing here?

90
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,140
Brother, let's not go home sober today.

91
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,299
Let's not. Come on, please.

92
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,279
Let's go, Sui Zhi. We're not leaving sober.

93
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,860
Thank you so much for today, Mu Dan.

94
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,010

95
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,000
Turns out, Mu Dan, guessed my identity.

96
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:20,900
I didn't intend to hide it. It's just a poorly kept plan harms success.

97
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,380
Your Majesty, you cherish the state&gt; and secretly aided me many times.

98
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,299
I'm deeply grateful and will certainly keep your secret.

99
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,559
Prince Ning has left, and the play is over. Everything is okay now.

100
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,340
When Liu Chang nearly searched the mansion before, I should've been on guard.

101
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,599
I've pretended to be a playboy for too long, thinking it was flawless.

102
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,959
Yet I never expected someone to come break my walls down.

103
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:57,760
I underestimated Prince Ning's suspicion, I should've prepared a backup in advance.

104
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,059
No one is a sage. How can anyone predict the enemy perfectly every time?

105
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:06,100
Just be more careful in the future.

106
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,620
The lives of countless people are tied to me.

107
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,579
If I take one wrong step, years of planning will come to nothing.

108
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:18,539
Even if I use my life as payback, it'd still be hard to atone.

109
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,860
The burden of the empire is something you carry with me.

110
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,880
You've given your utmost, so you shouldn't blame yourself.

111
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,220
This matter is due to my lack of consideration.

112
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,620
That's right, Your Majesty. Didn't we agree beforehand?

113
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,279
If we're exposed, you immediately sever ties with me.

114
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:47,140
Outside the secret room, you should've agreed with Prince Ning, not defend me.

115
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,139
I did promise you. But when the moment came, how could I bear it?

116
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:56,240
Precisely because we're like brothers, you should put righteousness above loyalty.

117
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,319
If such danger arises again, Your Majesty must let go of me.

118
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,980
Third Young Master, for the peaceful world we seek,

119
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,720
promise me.

120
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,520
Sui Zhi.

121
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,710
I promise you.

122
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,020
A kingdom's business requires good advisors and heroes to accomplish things.

123
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,620
Though a mere flower merchant, I'm driven by loyalty and righteousness.

124
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,479
In the future, if I can be of any help,
I am willing to offer my full support.

125
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
Mu Dan, please rise.

126
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,059
Mu Dan, with your righteousness, Sui Zhi is lucky to have you.

127
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,299
Meeting you is also a fortunate event for me.

128
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,620
You and I are more than just ruler and subject.

129
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,420
When acting is needed, just treat me as Third Young Master, no need for formalities.

130
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,660
Did you believe Jiang Chang Yang's slander?

131
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,900
I have no ulterior motives at all.

132
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,160
He mentioned Miss He as intentional provocation.

133
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,980
Whether I believe him doesn't matter. What I want are results.

134
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:20,000
I was incompetent, couldn't catch Jiang Chang Yang's flaws.

135
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:25,459
But with his nervous demeanor today, Jiang Residence must have secrets.

136
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,380
How could I not notice?

137
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:34,480
It's just several attempts revealed no flaws.

138
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,659
He'll surely be on guard, so be careful with future actions.

139
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,619
If you can't hit the mark in one strike, you mustn't rush.

140
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,319
Yes, I understand.

141
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,780
This is the whip I use for interrogating people.

142
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,040
Recently, through renovating, I learned many beautiful and cheap decoration methods.

143
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,440
With this cunning merchant assisting you, I guarantee steady profits.

144
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,140
Jiang Chang Yang, in the future, you don't need to pretend with me anymore.

145
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,279
What I do is fraught with danger.

146
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,459
You could peacefully run your small business, why get involved?

147
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:36,419
A petty person seeks personal gain, a gentleman seeks the country's welfare.

148
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,540
Though I'm a woman, I also have the heart to serve the country.

149
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,340
Moreover, if corrupt officials are in power, people's livelihoods will deteriorate.

150
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,319
What good days will we merchants have?

151
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,480
I do these things not only for you, but also for myself.

152
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,140
Alright, don't put on a long face.

153
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,939
Your sour look doesn't match the scenic wonderland I've set up for you.

154
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,820
I haven't even asked yet, how did you pull it off in so little time?

155
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,800
 Young Madam.

156
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,839
 You're also one of his people.

157
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,739
 Great, help me set this up.

158
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:45,420
 Set what up? I've moved all suspicious items away.

159
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,159
 Why are Jiang's people so foolish?

160
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,979
 If Prince Ning comes and sees nothing, he'll definitely become suspicious.

161
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,300
 After all, no one would bother to hide an empty house.

162
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,400
 Got it?

163
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,800
 - Hurry up.
 - Okay.

164
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,859
 Wait.

165
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,860
 What is this?

166
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,659
 This was mistaken as a secret message, it hasn't been dealt with yet.

167
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:15,380
 I'll take it away now.

168
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,019
 No need. It's useful, keep it.

169
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,919
Young Master.

170
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,340
Where is She Yan?

171
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,739
He was afraid of being scolded, so he flew away early.

172
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:30,239
This happened suddenly, it was normal to miscalculate.

173
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,580
However, today we owe it to She Yan.

174
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,559
With him flying around, he saved me a lot of effort.

175
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,620
If it were just me, I couldn't have set up all this before Liu Chang arrived.

176
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,300
She Yan asked me to thank Young Madam for him. He also prepared this.

177
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,459
Why so courteous?

178
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,960
These tolling bells have wild goose feathers on them.

179
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,259
It symbolizes growing old together.

180
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,979
She Yan said you two were about to celebrate your first anniversary.

181
00:20:55,979 --> 00:21:00,060
He's afraid he won't be in Chang'an and wants to send a gift in advance.

182
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,820
You two haven't forgotten such an important event, have you?

183
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,839
No, how could we forget?

184
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,000
Time does fly.

185
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,880
I wonder how many more years I can spend with you.

186
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,219
At the New Year's Eve court session,

187
00:23:56,219 --> 00:24:02,620
countries from afar sent envoys here, truly a blessing for our nation.

188
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,039
Today is the Beginning of Spring feast.

189
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,259
I specially invited you and your families to celebrate these glorious times!

190
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:14,739
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

191
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:19,039
I bow and pray for Tang dynasty's eternal prosperity.

192
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,480
 Pray for Tang dynasty's eternal prosperity.

193
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,359
Wait a moment.

194
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,340
His Majesty granted Nanzhao bamboo rice tribute to all on New Year's Eve.

195
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,739
Does Vice Minister Jiang think merchants don't deserve such noble items?

196
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:24,800
You didn't send one for Young Madam to try?

197
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:28,100
The festive season Floral Haven's busiest time.

198
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,380
I have countless accounts to check.

199
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,100
How can I care about meals?

200
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,960
Your stench of money is intolerable.

201
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,419
No matter how heavy the stench of money is, it's others who endure it.

202
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:45,219
Once the courtyard gate is closed, living comfortably is most important.

203
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:47,119
Don't you agree?

204
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,939
Vice Minister Jiang.

205
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:59,400
My wife's hands have always been for gardening and doing what she likes.

206
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,259
These miscellaneous tasks have always been my responsibility.

207
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:10,000
You make money every day and can buy whatever you want.

208
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,960
But you mustn't neglect your husband, either.

209
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,359
After the festival, how about we go to stay
for a few days at Mount Li?

210
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,780
Your Majesty, the swordsmanship of the noble warriors is unparalleled.

211
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,739
My younger daughter Ashina Dan has always wanted to seek instruction.

212
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:15,919
I wonder if Your Majesty would consent.

213
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,959
Please.

214
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
Great!

215
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:00,239
- Impressive.
 - Good! Good!

216
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,900
Well done.

217
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,060
- Impressive.
- Nice.

218
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,320
Nice.

219
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,119
Everyone says Princess Ashina Dan is the steppe's Heavenly Maiden Flower.

220
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,140
Now that I've seen it, she's indeed bright and imposing, rivaling any man.

221
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,660
Your Majesty, if the Heavenly Maiden Flower

222
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,060
is paired with a true dragon, what a good match that would be.

223
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,960
Royal Father.

224
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:39,540
The Princess truly has great skills.

225
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:46,680
But a bit embarrassing for noble warriors to be outmatched by a woman.

226
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,019
Our country is one of etiquette where guests are honored.

227
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,459
During a contest, one should naturally afford courtesy.

228
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,659
The envoy spoke inappropriately.

229
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,179
Better take a few volumes of the Nine Classics back to study

230
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:07,739
to avoid improper manners.

231
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:17,799
The Princess is radiant and captivating.

232
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,380
The warriors, eager for beauty, naturally show mercy.

233
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,620
Princess, would you like to spar with me?

234
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,420
Sure.

235
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,919
- Impressive.
 - Juebei Princess hit the target!

236
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,279
Consort Shu hit the target!

237
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:43,860
The spear and sword skills are evenly matched, even archery skills are too.

238
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,979
When will we see a result?

239
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:47,400
Indeed.

240
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,979
After Consort Shu gave birth to the prince, it's said she's taking medicine.

241
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:56,979
Continued competition like this may exhaust her strength.

242
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:02,779
If we lose, it'll be the royal family's dignity.

243
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,939
Consort Shu hit the target. Juebei Princess hit the target.

244
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:26,640
Again!

245
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,739
Your Majesty.

246
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:32,639
Shooting the target is boring. Let's change to shooting plum blossoms.

247
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:36,680
The buds are small, swaying in the wind and difficult to hit.

248
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,620
It can determine the winner and add elegance.

249
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:46,079
Consort Shu, Princess, what do you say?

250
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,219
Consort Shu wins.

251
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,599
- Well done!
 - Nice.

252
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,399
Great.

253
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:34,860
Consort Shu is a remarkable warrior, and the Princess unmatched in elegance.

254
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,499
This contest was truly a delight to watch.

255
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,199
Indeed.

256
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:45,259
Consort Shu, your skills are superior. I'm sincerely convinced.

257
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,499
I'm truly delighted to make friends through martial arts.

258
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:51,580
Our dynasty has a tradition of giving plants to friends as a gesture.

259
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,319
Princess, you've come from afar. This plum branch shall be my gift to you.

260
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,219
Thank you, Consort Shu.

261
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,419
The plum blossom buds are sparse and small, which is rather shabby.

262
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:12,140
I heard this country is known for peonies of unparalleled beauty.

263
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,739
But today, we don't get to see them.

264
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:20,960
Do you look down upon our frontier lands and intentionally hide them?

265
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,639
Envoy, your words are incorrect.

266
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,979
The way of Heaven is constant, and it doesn't flourish or perish for anyone.

267
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:35,340
Now isn't the blooming season for peonies. No one is hiding anything.

268
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,580
It seems the prosperity of the great nation is merely a facade.

269
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,340
Once winter arrives, the scenery loses its charm.

270
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,739
Unlike Nanzhao, where it's spring year round, thriving and prosperous.

271
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:52,380
Even with spring year round, can it prevent flowers from withering?

272
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,939
Nanzhao merely follows the natural seasons, why be so arrogant?

273
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:03,580
Porcelain, tea, cotton, and silk,

274
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,760
when you no longer purchase these from Tang,

275
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,499
then you may boast.

276
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:14,620
It's said that His Majesty is the Son of Heaven.

277
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:22,240
If so, can he defy the timing of Heaven and make peonies bloom in the snow?

278
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,820
The Son of Heaven pacifies states internally and secures peace externally.

279
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,960
Cultivating flowers a waste of his talent. This, my wife could easily do.

280
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:58,979
I've heard that women of the great nation are only indoors, commanding servants.

281
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:01,699
You wife can grow flowers?

282
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,580
My wife not only can grow flowers,

283
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,419
but she's also the renowned owner Floral Haven, He Wei Fang.

284
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:29,080
The famous Sleeve Lingering, Jade Terrace,

285
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,060
and Fire Gold Peony were all developed by her.

286
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:41,300
Your Majesty.

287
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,499
In Juebei, winter is long and warm days short.

288
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:47,340
Snow covers the ground all year, we've never seen flowers in the snow.

289
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,900
If the great nation can cultivate peonies in the snow,

290
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,660
it would be a great spectacle for us to behold.

291
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,780
I shall not fail my mission.

292
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,260
In eight days, I'll present snow peonies to showcase the great nation's elegance.

293
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,979
Enjoying flowers further demonstrates our dynasty's friendly relations with others.

294
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:20,140
When the peonies bloom in the snow. I'll invite everyone to visit the imperial garden.

295
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:44,139
♫  The Luo River cleanses the ridges of the moonlight  ♫

296
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,840
Shopkeeper, have some water.

297
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,099
- Thank you. Give it to Da Fu and the others.
 - Okay.

298
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:55,951
♫  A beauty refuses the temptation of the mortal world  ♫

299
00:35:55,951 --> 00:36:03,564
♫  Youthful splendor charts its own wandering course  ♫

300
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,139
♫  Do not let the mundane world bind you,  ♫

301
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:11,207
♫  nor shallow, presumptive gazes question you  ♫

302
00:36:11,207 --> 00:36:17,903
♫  Laugh as storms overturn the dust  ♫

303
00:36:17,903 --> 00:36:23,654
♫  A blooming flower with proud spirit reflects the color of the sky  ♫

304
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:25,555
♫  And never withering  ♫

305
00:36:25,555 --> 00:36:32,483
♫  Don’t let time tarnish the beauty of the fragrance  ♫

306
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,900
Quickly, close the door. Don't let the heat escape.

307
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,260
Why are you delivering the food today? Where's Da Fu?

308
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,619
Da Fu and Chuan Yu are having a snowball fight.

309
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,760
Come and eat. Cold food hurts your stomach.

310
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,400
It's so good.

311
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,119
What's this?

312
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,419
Today is the Shunxing Festival.

313
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,619
I planned to go to Kaiyuan Temple today to light a candle for my mother.

314
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,919
But I was so busy that I forgot.

315
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:43,660
Your fake husband went for you and even filled up the fragrant oil.

316
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,619
These flower lanterns were brought from the temple.

317
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:50,220
According to custom, nine lanterns should be lit in succession.

318
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,999
This way, the immortals will bless your new year with happiness and success.

319
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,760
Here.

320
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,280
We're grasshoppers tied to the same rope.

321
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,220
If you have bad luck, I naturally won't fare well either.

322
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,579
So, half of these blessing lanterns should go to you.

323
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,419
Jiang Chang Yang, you brought me a midnight snack.

324
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:53,900
You visited my mother and even helped me light the candles.

325
00:38:54,919 --> 00:39:00,280
You've done so much for me.

326
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,760
You said it yourself. We're allies.

327
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,780
You're busy here because of His Majesty.

328
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,519
I'm not good at growing flowers, but I can handle other things, right?

329
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:30,580
The promised time is approaching.

330
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,760
Will these peonies really bloom on time?

331
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:37,939
Of course.

332
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,039
They can't speak. How do you know?

333
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,820
I can predict their blooming time by feeling the softness of the buds.

334
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,720
Really?

335
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:50,700
Look.

336
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,760
If this bud is as hard as your knuckles, then it'll take another month.

337
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,539
When it gets as soft as your fingertips, there's about five days left.

338
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,560
When it gets as soft as the side of your palm…

339
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,779
Jiang Chang Yang.

340
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,319
Why are your cheeks so red?

341
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,600
The greenhouse is too hot. I'm going out for some air.

342
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,400
Wait a moment.

343
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,800
It's cold outside. Put something on.

344
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,300
Be careful not to catch a cold.

345

 'Fragrance Recital' - Zhang Zining

347
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,281
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

348
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:50,795
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

349
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:58,887
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

350
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:07,139
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

351
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:15,436
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

352
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:23,623
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

353
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:32,039
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

354
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:40,039
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

355
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:08,191
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

356
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:15,642
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

357
00:43:15,642 --> 00:43:23,728
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

358
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:31,937
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

359
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:40,299
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

360
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:48,455
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

361
00:43:48,455 --> 00:43:56,883
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

362
00:43:56,883 --> 00:44:05,083
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
