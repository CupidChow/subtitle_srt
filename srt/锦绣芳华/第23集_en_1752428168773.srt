Forward!

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Retreat!

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
March on!

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,080
On

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,120
быстрее!

20
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:18,500

Denis!

Parsons!

24
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,420
Fight!

25
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,460
Tactics!

26
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,340
Kill!

27
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Kill them!

28
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Kill them!

29
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Kill them!

30
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Kill them!

31
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Kill them!

32
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Kill them!

33
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Your Majesty!

34
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
This Yu Zheng

35
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,500
really got the real ship of the fishing factory.

36
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Only 50,000 soldiers

37
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
can survive until now.

38
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Add fuel!

39
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Fire!

40
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
When the battle began,

41
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
hundreds of slaves were sent out.

42
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
The firepower of the Central Army

43
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
was faster than I expected.

44
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
According to this trend,

45
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
50 barrels of fuel will be used

46
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
at night.

47
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
The situation on the battlefield

48
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
is completely in line with your prediction.

49
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
After dark, we can attack the enemy rear

50
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
and kill them.

51
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Kill them!

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Kill them!

53
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Kill them!

54
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Kill them!

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Kill them!

56
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Madam.

57
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
The firepower of the Central Army

58
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
was faster than I expected.

59
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I will attack them tonight.

60
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I will attack them tonight.

61
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
It seems that the victory is in this game.

62
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
It says that

63
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
the firepower of King Ning's ship

64
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
is very fast.

65
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I think the General expected

66
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
that it would be difficult for us to win.

67
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
So he planned to attack King Ning at night.

68
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
No matter what the situation is,

69
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
we have to attack at night.

70
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
First, Qin is the former king.

71
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
If Jiang Changyang

72
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
can enter the enemy camp and control King Ning,

73
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
he can end the war earlier.

74
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
So that more soldiers

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
can avoid bloodshed and death.

76
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Second, the position of the Central Army

77
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
is very high.

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Even if the Hedong Army

79
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
wins the war,

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
King Ning can retreat

81
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
from the narrow road between the two mountains.

82
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
The enemy of the sky

83
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
is hard to attack.

84
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
He has already prepared a retreat.

85
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
If he returns to Chang'an first

86
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
and turns black and white in front of the hundreds of soldiers,

87
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
then there will be no hope for the future.

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
The soldiers of the enemy army have already

89
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
retreated to the woods.

90
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Report!

91
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
General, the Central Army has stopped

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
the firepower attack.

93
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
The enemy is coming.

94
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
The commander and two officers of the enemy army

95
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
are still attacking the front line.

96
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
King Ning is retreating to the rear of the camp.

97
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
He retreated well.

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
He didn't even enter the camp, he didn't watch the battle.

99
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
It seems that King Ning really thinks that he is winning.

100
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Detect the army and move the horses.

101
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Yes!

102
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Hide the enemy.

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Yes.

104
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Hide the enemy.

105
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Report!

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
General!

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
What?

108
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
When the cavalry of the enemy army

109
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
approached King Ning's camp,

110
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
they were attacked by the enemy army.

111
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
The firepower was too strong.

112
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
The fire was too strong.

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
The general's reaction was fast.

114
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
He led the front line to retreat.

115
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
However, the soldiers of the enemy army

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
were still attacking the front line.

117
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
The enemy army was only ten people.

118
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Did you plan to retreat?

119
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Yes, I did!

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I still have some goose bumps.

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Do you know?

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Until now, the same soldiers have been不管ng King Ning.

123
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,660
In two years, the eunuchs have been

124
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
legalized as their soldiers.

125
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
What happened to King Ning?

126
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
I will report this to you as soon as I see the main camp retreating.

127
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
I can not check if there are evils.

128
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
One thing is for sure!

129
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,880
Let's go!

130
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,960
Does it work?

131
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Tuck in.

132
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,020
Where should we go?

133
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,180
You might notice.

134
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,780
We need help.

135
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,300
Come here!

136
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,160
Help!

137
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,620
Holy crap!!!

138
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,960
A

139
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,180
Attention all secondary officer!

140
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:25,100
D abroad

141
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
The fire burned the food.

142
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
When the fire was too big and the food was destroyed,

143
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,660
all the food was destroyed.

144
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
The people who were killed by the poison?

145
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Yes.

146
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
They were poisoned after the capture.

147
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
But we caught one alive.

148
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
What did they find?

149
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
They were hiding under the east mountain before the war.

150
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Because there were few people and they were hiding in the trees.

151
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
They were not found.

152
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,660
The King of Ning ordered them to wait for the signal.

153
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
When our army was in a state of emergency,

154
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
they came in and killed the commander.

155
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
But...

156
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:22,360
But our night

157
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,660
This is the last step of the King of Ning's plan to assassinate the commander.

158
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,660
But the King of Ning is in a state of panic.

159
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,660
He exposed the hidden hands in advance.

160
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,660
This is not necessarily a bad thing for the Houdon army.

161
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,660
But this night attack will not be able to kill the enemy.

162
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,660
I'm afraid this will take longer.

163
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Don't blame yourself.

164
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,660
Once the King of Ning is in a state of panic,

165
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
the main battlefield will be affected.

166
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
The Houdon army still has hope.

167
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660
The original plan was to fight quickly.

168
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Now the food is gone.

169
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
The Houdon soldiers are still fighting.

170
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,660
I'm afraid the south is in a hurry.

171
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
We will re-attach the food.

172
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
It will take a few days.

173
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,660
From tomorrow, we will put food in half.

174
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
The Houdon soldiers will put two and a half.

175
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,660
No matter what, we must guard the east.

176
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Yes.

177
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,660
The King of Ning's plan to assassinate the commander.

178
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Ma'am, the king told me

179
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
that if there was an accident,

180
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
he would take you to the east of the Houdon mountains,

181
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,660
The ship is on the shore. We'll leave tonight.

182
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Yunniang, I'll protect you.

183
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,660
If the country is at war, the people will be in danger.

184
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,660
As a citizen of Tang, we can't be safe.

185
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
But people need food, horses need grass.

186
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
If this war lasts for a long time,

187
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
won't the He Dong Army be forced to retreat?

188
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,660
The King of Niu has made a retreat for himself.

189
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
What about us?

190
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Hey!

191
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
The He Dong Army is on the shore, and it's on the shore.

192
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,660
If we can't win, can we just make a retreat?

193
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Yu Zheng and Jiang Changyang are not afraid of death.

194
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
How can they run away from war?

195
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Besides, the King of Niu has made a retreat for the He Dong Army.

196
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
If they run away, it's a big crime.

197
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,660
We'll put the people of He Dong into the river.

198
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
The He Dong Army has already prepared for the battle.

199
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
How can they prepare the ship in advance?

200
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
We have a ship.

201
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Our ship is in Qianhu.

202
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,660
If we put the food, we can transport it to the He Dong Army.

203
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Do you want to cross the river?

204
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
But the camp is located in the southwest of the water.

205
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
If you want to cross the river, you need to cross the river.

206
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
The river is wide and the water flows slowly.

207
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
If you cross the river, you may die.

208
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,660
But if you can cross the river,

209
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,660
you can get some food for the He Dong Army.

210
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
Then you will win.

211
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
I'll do as you say.

212
00:14:50,660 --> 00:15:20,660
He Dong's army provided the troops with supply and supplies of food for the stretch bandic

213
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Master Teng!

215
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
Master Yang, why are you here?

216
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
This is my father-in-law's fishing boat.

217
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,660
It's not big enough, so I brought some food for him.

218
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Also, it's cold in the north.

219
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
The soldiers are going to the village to get some food.

220
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,660
I brought some medicine for the army.

221
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,660
It's good for your health.

222
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
The water is fierce, so it's hard to cross the river.

223
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
I appreciate your kindness.

224
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Please don't take any more risks.

225
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
It's okay.

226
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Master Feng!

227
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
You drove us away from the north.

228
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
You brought us to the north and sealed the city.

229
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Now we're going to revenge you.

230
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Don't refuse us.

231
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Moreover, the river is in danger.

232
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
General Yu is killing the enemy.

233
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
We can't just sit and watch.

234
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Yes.

235
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Master Feng is a man of the trade.

236
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
He's a man of justice.

237
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
General, you're not a man of the trade.

238
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
You can take risks for the army.

239
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,660
We should help the soldiers on the battlefield.

240
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Yes, we should.

241
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,660
In that case, thank you.

242
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Dafu, Zhangchen!

243
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
Yes.

244
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Zhangchen!

245
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Give me one.

246
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
This one is for Li Hua.

247
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Master Feng!

248
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
My wife brought a lot of food.

249
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
She'll deliver it to you soon.

250
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Thank you.

251
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Master Feng, my shop also has a small ship.

252
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
You can find a lot of food.

253
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
The cook will deliver it to you.

254
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Okay, thank you.

255
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
You're welcome.

256
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Thank you.

257
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,660
Master Feng, the fire of the King of Ning is still burning.

258
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
We can't even drink the soup.

259
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
If we keep doing this...

260
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Inform the cavalry and the small team to check the weapons.

261
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
We'll gather after a moment.

262
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
You're going to the battlefield in person?

263
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
You've been in the battlefield for years.

264
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
You've never fought with the army.

265
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
I can't fight with the army.

266
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
But I have the skills.

267
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,660
If I can kill one enemy, I'll make one move.

268
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
If I can kill one enemy, I'll make one move.

269
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
If I can kill two, I'll make two moves.

270
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Your Majesty, the night attack has failed.

271
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
General Yu is still in the front line.

272
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
How can I hide in the camp and be a close-up?

273
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
I understand.

274
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
Report!

275
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,660
We found a ship on the back of the camp.

276
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Look!

277
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
We're here.

278
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Mudan?

279
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
There are rice and noodles in this food.

280
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
And the sauce made by the people of He Dong.

281
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
It's enough for soldiers to eat for two or three days.

282
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
If it's not enough, I'll think of something.

283
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Thank you.

284
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Thank you.

285
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Tell the soldiers that the people of He Dong are with them.

286
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Tell them not to be discouraged.

287
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
We'll wait for them to come back.

288
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
What is this?

289
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Thank you.

290
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Thank you, Master He.

291
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Master, the small fishing boat of Master Yang didn't block the way.

292
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,660
If you encounter a flood, the food will be damaged.

293
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,660
Go back to the shop and cover it with the firewood we left in the camp.

294
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,660
It can help the food to prevent flooding and flooding.

295
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,660
If the boat moves, it can be a fire.

296
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,660
It can also prevent the fire from burning the food.

297
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
Okay, I'll go get it.

298
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Go.

299
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Da Fu!

300
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
I just said the firewood.

301
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,660
Yes, there's still some left. What's wrong?

302
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
The fire was destroyed overnight.

303
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,660
If we have these strong and fireproof materials, we can make a fire-resistant cloth.

304
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
A fire-resistant cloth?

305
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I'll go get it.

306
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,660
Go.

307
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,660
There are many fire-resistant cloths in the warehouse that were traded with the North.

308
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:04,240
But this cloth is sold to the nine-fourth

309
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,320
The cloth is sewn together into a wide-bottomed

310
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
and made of cotton.

311
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,320
It's used to deal with fire.

312
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
I'll take this one.

313
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I've added a material to the size.

314
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
It can withstand the fire in front of it.

315
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
It won't prevent the soldiers from riding on the river.

316
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,320
I've ordered the camp to send in the wounded.

317
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Prepare for the second night.

318
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Light the fire and get close to the horse.

319
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Let them get used to the fire.

320
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
In case they meet a fire, they'll make a mess.

321
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Yes.

322
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Where is the King of the Ming?

323
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,320
According to the front line, he's still resting in the camp.

324
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
The camp must be in front of the dawn.

325
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Get to the rear of the Central Army.

326
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Yes.

327
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Report!

328
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
The enemy's small team is approaching the camp.

329
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Yes.

330
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
They're not ready.

331
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
The King is smart.

332
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Jiang Changyang is not a coward.

333
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
The little boy is in a mess.

334
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
How's the preparation?

335
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

336
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I've ordered the people to fill the fire with soil.

337
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
It will make them die.

338
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Make it quick.

339
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Take the head of Jiang Changyang and come to see me.

340
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Yes.

341
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Take the head of Jiang Changyang and come to see me.

342
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Yes.

343
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Put the arrows down!

344
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Fire!

345
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Fire!

346
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Fire!

347
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Don't let them get close to the King!

348
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
The enemy is coming!

349
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Come back to the camp!

350
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes!

351
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,560
Fire!

352
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,560
Fire!

353
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,560
Fire!

354
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Who is the traitor?

355
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
I can't tell you.

356
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
The God's decree is here.

357
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Soldiers, listen!

358
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,560
King of Ning Li Xian slandered the He Dong Army.

359
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
He slandered the army and tried to rebel.

360
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
He wanted to kill them.

361
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,640
The He Dong's governor, Yu Zhen, was ordered to capture the rebels.

362
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,640
The rebels were all killed in the same place.

363
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,640
King of Ning is the real traitor.

364
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
The foundation has been twisted.

365
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
No.

366
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's all over.

367
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,640
King of Ning, you've never been a righteous man who can pacify the rebels.

368
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
The God's decree is here.

369
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
If you continue to resist, you will become a traitor.

370
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
You will be punished.

371
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Go!

372
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Come back!

373
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Don't be fooled by him!

374
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
Come back!

375
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,640
King of Ning, you've always looked down on the gods.

376
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,720
King of Ning, you've always looked down on the women of Shanggu.

377
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Who brought the decree?

378
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
So the father and son are loyal to each other.

379
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
They will never betray King of Ning.

380
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
There must be a war between them.

381
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I want to give the He Dong Army a fair and just statement.

382
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
Before the battle, Yu Zhen was fighting for King of Qin.

383
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
But this war must be won.

384
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Only if we win, this is the supreme decree.

385
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
If we lose, it's a waste of time.

386
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
The flowers are blooming so well.

387
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
The azaleas here are also beautiful.

388
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
The wind is blowing.

389
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Be careful not to catch a cold.

390
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
There is no trouble in Jinzhou.

391
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
You should go back to Hexi as soon as possible.

392
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Take care, Consort Shu.

393
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Go.

394
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Go.

395
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Go.

396
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Can you mess up my morale with this so-called decree?

397
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Do you know the truth of this decree?

398
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Soldiers, the general is outside.

399
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
The army's life is at stake.

400
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
You have to listen to me here.

401
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Jiang Changyang, I'm asking you.

402
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
You have less than 50,000 soldiers.

403
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
How can you defeat me?

404
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Even if you capture me now,

405
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,960
the Hexi Army and the Jianan Army will not sit idly by.

406
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I'll make it clear.

407
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
To prove that they are not rebels,

408
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,040
they will try their best to save me.

409
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
I will remember.

410
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Who will win this battle in the end?

411
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Who is the righteous one?

412
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
The army is coming.

413
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
My people are coming.

414
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
What did I say?

415
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Your Majesty.

416
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
At ease.

417
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Your Majesty.

418
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Your Majesty.

419
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Your Majesty.

420
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Your Majesty.

421
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,200
It seems that justice belongs to the He Dong Army.

422
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Prince Ning,

423
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,200
you've always wanted the list of allies in my hand.

424
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Today I would like to present to you

425
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
an important ally of mine.

426
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Little Master Wen.

427
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Little Master Wen.

428
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
Little man.

429
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
My people,

430
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,280
you are the strongest warriors of the Central Plains.

431
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Li Ying and the commander are all in the palace.

432
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Take your weapons and go back to the capital with me.

433
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
When the great cause is done,

434
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,280
you and your descendants will have the glory of the world.

435
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Prince Ning.

436
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
You have already given up.

437
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,280
Do you want to rebel?

438
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
So what?

439
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Fight!

440
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,280
Fight!

441
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Your Majesty,

442
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,280
now our army is in a panic.

443
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
We lost our ally.

444
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
You have no power to fight.

445
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
I will...

446
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
I was wrong about you.

447
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Despicable!

448
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,280
You are not only a leg,

449
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,280
but also a bone and blood.

450
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
I'm just good at judging and taking things into account.

451
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
In the past, it was a big deal.

452
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Now it's a big deal.

453
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,280
I have never changed my behavior.

454
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,360
But you are no longer a big deal.

455
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,360
I am Liu Chang, the deputy commander of the Ministry of War.

456
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,360
I am willing to surrender and plead guilty.

457
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I know I have committed a grave mistake.

458
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
I will take the opportunity to rebel.

459
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Prince Ning is a criminal.

460
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
He has killed all of us.

461
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,440
I have evidence.

462
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,440
I am willing to cooperate with General Yu Zheng

463
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
to investigate this case.

464
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
I will kill all of you.

465
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I will take the throne.

466
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,720
This is all because of you.

467
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,040
My word is almost certain that

468
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,360
this madam is behind this group.

469
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Well!

470
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,480
Right in the center,

471
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
under my command.

472
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,960
Who for полезiness can die hitherto?

473
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Princess Anru woke me up with high spirits.

474
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
investment decided might not be able to exercise forces

475
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,640
to make the new canopy

476
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,900
And that's enough

477
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,560
By a favor of theост전에i

478
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
For your sincere20%

479
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,560
But for the sake of the crime, I am willing to forgive you.

480
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,560
If you are guilty of abuse, you will be punished.

481
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

482
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Your Majesty, I have one more request.

483
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Speak.

484
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I beg Your Majesty to forgive her.

485
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,560
She is the daughter of Prince of Ning, but she never participated in the rebellion.

486
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,560
The royal family of the Li family is precious.

487
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Her Majesty's blood is her love.

488
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I beg Your Majesty to spare her life.

489
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,560
My husband and I have no power, no children, no daughters.

490
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,560
We will not create any trouble.

491
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I beg Your Majesty to forgive her.

492
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,560
She is the daughter of the Li family.

493
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Master,

494
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
General Yu,

495
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Brother Zhang Qiu,

496
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,560
and all the comrades of the rebellion,

497
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,560
now the trouble is over.

498
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,560
The situation is stable.

499
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Are you at ease?

500
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I will do my best to protect the rebellion.

501
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
I hope you can rest assured.

502
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,560
May the heaven bless the Tang Dynasty.

503
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,560
May the heaven bless the Tang Dynasty.

504
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,560
May the heaven bless the Tang Dynasty.

505
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Let's go.

506
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Are you really determined to leave He Weifang?

507
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,560
I've been through too much and I can't explain it to others.

508
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Besides, the flower-mouse of Ning Chen has died.

509
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Why don't I continue to be the carefree shopkeeper?

510
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
It doesn't matter if you're Jiang Cheng or not.

511
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,560
It's just a pity that my house is in Jiang's mansion.

512
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Yes. You said that my flowers and soil were hard to grow.

513
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Why don't we sneak in and steal the soil?

514
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,560
I'm homeless. Why do you care about the soil?

515
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
You should know that I'm a carefree shopkeeper.

516
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,560
But the garden is big and there are many rooms.

517
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
You can choose one. I don't mind.

518
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
The shopkeeper is not in Chang'an.

519
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
The workers who stay in Chang'an can do it.

520
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
They can do it for more than a year.

521
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,560
The business is so big that the visitors won't be less.

522
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I must teach you some tricks.

523
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,560
If you're an old friend, you won't be embarrassed to run away.

524
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Okay. You can do it.

525
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I have my own way of doing it.

526
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,560
What if you get caught?

527
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
What do you think?

528
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,560
You think I'm easy to deal with?

529
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Please spare me.

530
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm sorry.

531
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
You've been away for a long time.

532
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,560
You kept thinking about the wine you made in the palace.

533
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
I'm glad to hear that.

534
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
Luckily, Li Xian is in the list of the most powerful.

535
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
If he really wants to kill you...

536
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
If he really wants to kill me, how can he get rid of Feng Shen?

537
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
I have to thank him for his sharp knife skills.

538
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
He took half of my life, but he still left me a breath.

539
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
You've already died once.

540
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Why are you still so heartless?

541
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
I've given up my country and returned to my country.

542
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I'm a teacher.

543
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I'm a teacher.

544
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I'm a teacher.

545
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I'm a teacher.

546
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I'm a teacher.

547
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Now he's an engineer.

548
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I've looked up to my teacher.

549
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Even though we called each other 150 years ago,

550
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
I would still remember it.

551
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
You can't blame yourself.

552
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Sui Zhi, you know this.

553
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
I've never treated you like I do it.

554
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
You and I were of the same tribe.

555
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
So no matter when you died,

556
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
I wouldn't try to harm you.

557
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I will...

558
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

559
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,560
You think I don't know what you're up to?

560
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You want to get me drunk and make me do your request?

561
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Now that the army is back, the sea is clear.

562
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,560
The comrades and the people of Mengzhou are at peace.

563
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,560
In the future, it will depend on the great progress of the Third Master.

564
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
My wish has been fulfilled.

565
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
You can't be too greedy.

566
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
You're a loyal man.

567
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Why can't you just return to your position?

568
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
My position with Mudan is awkward.

569
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
If the great Zhang Qi Gu comes back to life,

570
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
there will be too many questions to be answered.

571
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
How can I explain it?

572
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Besides, I don't care about the high-ranking officials and the high-ranking officials.

573
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
You don't care about the clan of the Qing Dynasty.

574
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
What about Mudan?

575
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
He's the same as me.

576
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
The empire is vast.

577
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,560
The officials of each state and each province are inevitably under surveillance.

578
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
Mudan is a man of great power.

579
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
I'm a thousand miles away from the Third Master.

580
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
I will not be able to see the light and see the evil.

581
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,560
You just want to travel the mountains and play with water with Mudan.

582
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
You want to leave me alone.

583
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,560
You're alone, cold and quiet.

584
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Can you say this again in front of the concubine?

585
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Third Master.

586
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
As you wish.

587
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
I'm sorry.

588
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,560
The shop of the shopkeeper is about to reopen.

589
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Why are you still so sad?

590
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I haven't figured out how to tell you about the departure.

591
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
I don't want to see you crying.

592
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
It's better to leave without telling you.

593
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
We're addicted to your words.

594
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
How can we do that?

595
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
We finally came back safely.

596
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,560
If we leave like this, everyone will be sad.

597
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
How's the preparation going?

598
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Don't worry.

599
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,640
I've already handed it to the

600
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
Concubine.

601
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
It will be ready in a few days.

602
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Okay.

603
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
Hengtong, come here.

604
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
Hengtong.

605
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Come here, Hengtong.

606
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
The one we talked about last time is not very good.

607
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
What are you looking at them for?

608
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
I'm looking for the one who can help me.

609
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
I'm not going to help you.

610
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I'm not going to help you.

611
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
