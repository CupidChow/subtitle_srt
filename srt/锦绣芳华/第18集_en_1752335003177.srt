1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Z24

2
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,660
drink a glass of wine

3
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,780
To remember me

4
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,460
In the world ...

5
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
But just start

6
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,240
A shops strike

7
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,880
Winter이에요

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,580
I just remember

9
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,060
boa konseciente

10
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,460
An iconic work

11
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,060
From today, all kinds of meat and wine must be tasted.

12
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,060
They can't even get into the East-West room

13
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,260
and practice oil.

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,660
Liu Jun is so smart.

15
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,260
Liu Jun is so smart.

16
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,860
Without oil lamps,

17
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,860
they can't read for hours every day.

18
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,660
They will make a mess.

19
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,460
I'm afraid my son won't open the door.

20
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,860
Once he gets to the food store,

21
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,660
he won't be able to force himself.

22
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,860
Father.

23
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,860
You all are so loyal to His Majesty.

24
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,660
He is always at your service.

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,260
If you tell him to come here in advance,

26
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,660
are you afraid that you can't win?

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,860
Zhang Qiufeng

28
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,260
is so stupid.

29
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
When I got the news,

30
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Jiangfu was already searched.

31
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,260
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,460
I'm so ashamed.

33
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,860
Don't be so rude to me

34
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,860
because of such a stupid outsider.

35
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Your Majesty, I'm too timid.

36
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,860
I was beaten and killed

37
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
for a small sum of money.

38
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,860
How dare I do something so cheap?

39
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
I don't agree with you.

40
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,860
The family is the foundation of our country.

41
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,260
Our Emperor can ignore the solidity of the society.

42
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
But we, as his subjects,

43
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,660
can't help him.

44
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,260
You are also a great man.

45
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,060
Are you going to give up the government in the future?

46
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,060
Or do you want to help me

47
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,460
because the Emperor has his own will?

48
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,260
Why don't people have their own plans?

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,860
The money you sent me

50
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
will be spent sooner or later.

51
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,060
But if I can get another flower,

52
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,060
I can spend the rest of my life with you.

53
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,460
What do you want?

54
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,460
It's just a hand in hand for me.

55
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,460
That's easy.

56
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,060
I'll ask the saint to help you

57
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,060
to the position of official tomorrow.

58
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,860
The Ministry of Rites will ask you to manage it.

60
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,660
The final decision will be made by the saint.

61
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,260
I will accompany you.

62
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,460
Please rest assured.

63
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,460
Once it's done,

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,260
I will have no more detestations.

65
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,660
The lamp oil was sent by General.

66
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,460
It took several days.

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,860
The exam is about to start.

68
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,260
But I can't study.

69
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,260
I have to buy the lamp oil.

70
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
If you buy the lamp oil at a high price,

71
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,660
it will shock Prince Ning.

72
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,460
The family has a lot of blood.

73
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,660
They have also made a lot of money.

74
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,060
Why can't we let them go?

75
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,060
We can't go straight to the capital without a way.

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,660
We will be in the capital for a long time.

77
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,660
Did you give the body to Prince Ning?

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,460
They are in charge of both.

79
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,260
We have to figure out a solution as soon as possible.

80
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,260
Take this.

81
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,860
Thank you, my lady.

82
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,060
Thank you, my lady.

83
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,860
Don't be polite.

84
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,860
You have been studying for years, but you have not learned.

85
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,260
If you overthink,

86
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,060
you'll lose the one you love.

87
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Come here.

88
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,060
After the reading, you should rest early.

89
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Where did you get so much oil?

90
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
We ran around the oil shop during the day, but didn't buy any.

91
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,060
I wonder if you can sell us some?

92
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,060
I only sell oil.

93
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Tomorrow I will send you more oil.

94
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
To ensure that you can work on it.

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
Thank you, madam.

96
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
Thank you, madam.

97
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
You're welcome.

98
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Where did you get the oil from?

99
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
Not only the flesh can be used.

100
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Have you seen the lily?

101
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
The wine is also floating.

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
It's not enough to make oil from grass, is it?

103
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
To supply so many people at the same time,

104
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
it takes at least a day to use.

105
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,060
It doesn't need to be done in a day.

106
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
I've tried many ways to make oil.

107
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,060
The most suitable oil is now available.

108
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
Don't worry.

109
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Follow me.

110
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,060
It smells good.

111
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,020
The seeds of the

112
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,060
horse and the cloud are fried and then used.

113
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
The rest is not ripe yet.

114
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,060
So I asked the villagers to disguise as merchants.

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,060
To buy the seeds of the horse and the cloud separately.

116
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
Which way?

117
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
Hold one by one.

118
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,060
Harder.

119
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
One, two, hit!

120
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,060
One, two, hit!

121
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
One, two, hit!

122
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
One, two, hit!

123
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
Look.

124
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,060
This is the oil you sent yesterday.

125
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,060
This oil is no different from the oil in the deep.

126
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
It's not only for lighting,

127
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
but also for cooking.

128
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
It smells very fresh.

129
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,060
I've tried many ways in ancient times.

130
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Crush, grind, soak, steam.

131
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
It's not as much as this.

132
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,060
If you send this oil to the land of the dead,

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,060
it will be much easier.

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
I'm tired.

135
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,060
I'll do it.

136
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,060
I'll do it.

137
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,060
You're used to it.

138
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,060
You think you can solve everything by yourself.

139
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
But you can't do it with this oil.

140
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Even if you're strong,

141
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,060
even if you can lift a hundred pounds of dry food,

142
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
you need someone to help you.

143
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Otherwise, you can't even hit a stone.

144
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,060
You can't even hit a stone.

145
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
You're always thinking about the way to hit a bowl.

146
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Fine.

147
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
You can point at the mountain and river.

148
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,060
I'll point at the river.

149
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
I'll point at the river.

150
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
Okay, okay.

151
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
I'm tired.

152
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,060
I'll arrange someone to do this kind of work.

153
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,060
I'll arrange someone to do this kind of work.

154
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,060
When did you come?

155
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,060
We came to the place where we can hit a stone.

156
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
Master Xu.

157
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
Have you seen the other rooms?

158
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
How do you feel?

159
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,060
It's not just a piece of jewelry.

160
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
Even if we can send some more people here,

161
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
the oil will be sufficient.

162
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,060
A few people don't know what you're doing.

163
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,060
They will feel safer.

164
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,060
When the oil is transported to the city,

165
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,060
I'll give it to the students.

166
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
You're going to hold the exam.

167
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
Don't delay the study.

168
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
I can go to the south and drop my shoes.

169
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
It's okay.

170
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,060
I've studied in the provincial office for nine years.

171
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm sure that you will win the title.

172
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
This time, you gave Hanmen and the Shizu

173
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,060
a fair chance to win the title.

174
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
I'm confident that I can win the title.

175
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,060
I will not let Xu Jijiu and your hard work go to waste.

176
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,060
The day is coming, and the day is coming.

177
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,060
You have a lot of talent.

178
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,060
I believe that you will win the title.

179
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
Thank you, teacher.

180
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,060
As long as we can enter the city, it's easy to tell who will be the one to distribute the oil.

181
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Now, the city's guards are all under Prince Ning's command.

182
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,060
They will check the city's security.

183
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,060
It's not easy to move all these oil into the city.

184
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
I have an idea.

185
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,060
I worked in a bar before.

186
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,060
I saw that the oil was lighter than the wine.

187
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,060
If we put all these oil in a jar,

188
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
even if the guards have to check,

189
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,060
we can just take out the wine from the jar and taste it.

190
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,060
You have a broad mind and a deep mind.

191
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I thank you on behalf of the students.

192
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
You are welcome.

193
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,060
The heart of the nation is not for men and women.

194
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,060
I hope that the students will be able to fight for their lives after they graduate from high school.

195
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,060
The future of the people of the holy county depends on you.

196
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,060
The forbidden word is  Nejenshiwa, meaning it's all.

197
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:11,060
But people call it S 거의等於無助了 I have time to be by their side.

198
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,060
They can light up the way and give them all.

199
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,060
You didn't want to weep in the village?

200
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,060
What do you know about me?

201
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,060
I can tell you whatever you want to know.

202
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,380
You said that the fire in Fangyuan broke your heart.

203
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,980
But the fire in Mengzhou, you...

204
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,580
Such a cruel past,

205
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,380
I can't let it go.

206
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Prince Ning killed so many people

207
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,900
because of a fire that could burn my heart.

208
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
But he was wrong.

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Instead, because of a fire,

210
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
I could see through it.

211
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
It was Prince Ning who set fire to Mengzhou,

212
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
but he was drunk and hit the head of the people.

213
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
How could he burn the princess?

214
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
I don't know.

215
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
You're dying.

216
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
There are many people who died before.

217
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm just trying to calm down.

218
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,420
People who have power and power will never let us go.

219
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
Don't worry.

220
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Don't worry.

221
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
We have it all.

222
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,420
Come on.

223
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Here you are.

224
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Thank you.

225
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Be careful.

226
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
We have it all.

227
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
I met myself full of sense of shame.

228
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
I found myself who was born with heart.

229
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
I'm a person who believes in myself.

230
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
I'm a person who is brave and brave.

231
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
I'm a person who will live to see your beauty.

232
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
I invite you to watch the show.

233
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
I invite you to watch the show.

234
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I invite you to watch the show.

235
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I invite you to watch the show.

236
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I invite you to watch the show.

237
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Come on.

238
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Be careful.

239
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Watch out.

240
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Be careful.

241
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Where did you get the food?

242
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
I got it from the warehouse.

243
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Here.

244
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Be careful.

245
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,940
Thank you.

246
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,940
The king of Ning is talking about Mingyuan.

247
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,940
The people who are in power are noble.

248
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
They should be punished.

249
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,940
It's the most important thing to calm down the people.

250
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Here.

251
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Be careful.

252
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Come with me.

253
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Hurry.

254
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
It's the first time that the third prince has left the palace.

255
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,460
But he is very familiar with the reputation of Mengzhou.

256
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
The king of Ning is very proud.

257
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
He chose some officials.

258
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
He helped many people in the palace.

259
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
He saved many lives.

260
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
So you saw the third prince.

261
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
He is a noble and strong man.

262
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,980
Only he is a saint.

263
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
The people can live a peaceful life.

264
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Yes.

265
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Since then,

266
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
I have decided to follow the right path.

267
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,980
If I am right,

268
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,980
I will not be afraid to scold the people.

269
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
So even if

270
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
others feel sorry for you,

271
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
you are also a good person.

272
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
I once lived alone

273
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
and died.

274
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
How lucky to meet you.

275
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
You know me.

276
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
You are with me.

277
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
We work together.

278
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
We work together.

279
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
One day we will see

280
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
the right path and the wrong path.

281
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Mingkang.

282
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
And four days you will be fed.

283
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We'll have the tea.

284
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
The tea.

285
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes.

286
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,620
Let's open the Roman fillets.

287
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Ok.

288
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Fillets with psycho transitions?

289
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Correct.

290
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,620
Mr. Yevgeny, we have a light.

291
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Come on.

292
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Where?

293
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,620
Look.

294
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Thank you.

295
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Here.

296
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,620
The great hero of the Han Dynasty,

297
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
the king of the Han Dynasty,

298
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
the king of the Han Dynasty,

299
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
the king of the Han Dynasty,

300
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,620
the king of the Han Dynasty,

301
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,620
the king of the Han Dynasty,

302
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
the king of the Han Dynasty.

303
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,620
I wish your good luck.

304
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Thank you.

305
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
You're not a simple man.

306
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
You're like them.

307
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
Mr. Chu.

308
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
I asked you to drink with me a few days ago.

309
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Why didn't you go?

310
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
I have something to do.

311
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Come on.

312
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Chong,

313
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,620
I'm glad to see you.

314
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,620
I'm the son of the great master

315
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
of the Song Dynasty.

316
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
I'm sure you'll be honored.

317
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,620
I hope you'll be

318
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
as kind as the old.

319
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
We'll remember you.

320
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Sing the name.

321
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
Yes.

322
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Huang Qingyun from Song.

323
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Qi Da from Bo.

324
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Comrades, I'm going in.

325
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Zhu Qiong from Jingzhao.

326
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Sun Zhi from Mengzhou.

327
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm Zhu Qiong, the son of Si Nongqing.

328
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Mr. Zhu.

329
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Find me a large and warm single room

330
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
and make me a fire.

331
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Don't get sick for three days.

332
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Yes.

333
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,620
Take it.

334
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Zhang Song from Weizhou.

335
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
You haven't asked for a drink.

336
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
You're really a man.

337
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,620
You haven't asked for a drink.

338
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Are you sure you can get the title?

339
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Jingzhao Ma Bing.

340
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Everyone,

341
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
cold and bitter poison

342
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
is only for Jingzhao.

343
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Please think carefully

344
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,620
and make a good decision.

345
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
We can't give the great He Shan

346
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
to these cruel people.

347
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
You're right.

348
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Everyone, please.

349
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Zhenzhou Liangguanwu.

350
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Zhenzhou Liangguanwu.

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
Get up!

352
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,620
Get up!

353
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
Okay.

354
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Come on, come on.

355
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
What's wrong?

356
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Water! Fire!

357
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Where are you going?

358
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Water!

359
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,620
Help!

360
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
Water!

361
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Help!

362
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
Help!

363
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
Help!

364
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Help!

365
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
Help!

366
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Help!

367
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Hurry!

368
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Take the students to the school!

369
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
Take the students to the school!

370
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
Hurry!

371
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
Help!

372
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Run!

373
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,620
Run!

374
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,620
The spring breeze came late this year.

375
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,620
I didn't expect it would come so late.

376
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
When did you learn the jade system?

377
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
When did you learn the art of jade?

378
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
The palace has our people.

379
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
The lanterns are also made of the hand.

380
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
You just need to light a candle.

381
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
The scrolls of a person are destroyed.

382
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Everyone has to re-examine.

383
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
When you were stealing the king's scrolls,

384
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
you had already planned all this, right?

385
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
The king's trust is important.

386
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
The justice of the imperial examination can't be lost.

387
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
The fake king can't fool you, the fake villain.

388
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
I asked my daughter to come up with a idea.

389
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
She said she would study further.

390
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,340
The wind is blowing so hard, you are wearing flvalue dress.

391
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,340
Are you cold?

392
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,160
I just want to give you a chance toounteract coldness.

393
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
You are my wife now.

394
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
When things startry, you can get cold.

395
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Don't running away because of this habit of yours.

396
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Yin Chang rain...

397
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
You're good at martial arts, aren't you?

398
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Now I know why I didn't teach you.

399
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,620
I was afraid that I would never beat you.

400
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Zhang Changyang, you've been working so hard for a long time.

401
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,620
Did you finally make it tonight?

402
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,620
I'm not a good dancer.

403
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,620
I'm not a good dancer.

404
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,620
I'm not a good dancer.

405
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,620
I'm not a good dancer.

406
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I'm not a good dancer.

407
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,620
I'm not a good dancer.

408
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,620
I'm not a good dancer.

409
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,620
I'm not a good dancer.

410
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,620
I'm not a good dancer.

411
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,620
I'm tired...

412
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,620
I'm tired.

413
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,620
Fire-Jump

414
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,620
As long as I'm with you, I'll be happy with anything.

415
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
I got you this time.

416
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Jiang Xiaoyou, let me go!

417
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,620
You're so good at it.

419
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
Yang Xiu, relax.

420
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
We've tried our best.

421
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Yes, thank you.

422
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
Goodbye.

423
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Everyone, come here.

424
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
Let's have a rest.

425
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Okay.

426
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
This way.

427
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
Let's rest.

428
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Do you know who I am?

429
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
Move!

430
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
You don't need to tell us.

431
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,620
We'll give you a ride.

432
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,620
No matter who's in the car.

433
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
What do you know?

434
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
I'm a Zitan Mudan.

435
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
I can't find a few in Chang'an.

436
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Let's rest.

437
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,620
You're a fool.

438
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,620
You can't even hear the sound of a car.

439
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,620
If he can sense the other's intentions,

440
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,620
he won't need to worry about others.

441
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
General, I've asked the people to move the car.

442
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
There's no need to bother you.

443
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
Mudan!

444
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
What?

445
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
What are you doing here?

446
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
I'm here to see you.

447
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Don't you want to see me?

448
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Mudan!

449
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Who's there?

450
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
This is my beloved Mudan.

451
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
It's a gift from the gods.

452
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
How's your harvest today?

453
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
It's good.

454
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
It's only half a day.

455
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
We'll be back soon.

456
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Good.

457
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
Since you've met,

458
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
let's rest.

459
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
The roast is ready.

460
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
Serve the lady.

461
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
Yes.

462
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Let's go.

463
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
Enjoy the meat.

464
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Okay.

465
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Brother Tang.

466
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
The flowers and birds are injured.

467
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Why did you deliver them yourself?

468
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
If it wasn't for the owner,

469
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
how could the shop be so successful?

470
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
It's a holy place.

471
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
You're a beautiful woman.

472
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
You're not a good husband.

473
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
You're always out.

474
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
You're a bad woman.

475
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
You're a bad husband.

476
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
What are you doing?

477
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Let's go.

478
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
You're out of town today.

479
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Why?

480
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,620
The god sent a letter

481
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
saying that there's a rat.

482
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
We're late.

483
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
You must be careful

484
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
when coming to the holy place.

485
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
I got it.

486
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
You?

487
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Are you tired?

488
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
I've spent a lot of time

489
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
talking about the one who's bored.

490
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,620
Mr. Zhu has no one in his heart.

491
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,620
He's weak.

492
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
He's an acrobat.

493
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,620
I have to make a bad arrangement.

494
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,620
You said before that the people behind Prince Ning are all noble families.

495
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,620
The powerful officials of the court are cautious and smart.

496
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,620
They are hard to buy. But their children are spoiled.

497
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Have you ever thought of starting from now

498
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,620
and leading them to leave Prince Ning with their father?

499
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
My idea is not good.

500
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
I won't say it. Let's go.

501
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,620
You are not in the court, but you look like a playboy.

502
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,620
You are thinking of me.

503
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,620
Are you praising me or yourself?

504
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,620
We are family. It's the same.

505
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,620
I only drank wine. I haven't seen so many flowers.

506
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,620
This is really a snowy night.

507
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Jia Changyang, we are old friends now.

508
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,620
I only want to live a little slower.

509
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
A little slower.

510
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,620
The day has passed. We are busy.

511
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
We haven't been out together for a long time.

512
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,620
If it weren't for this coincidence,

513
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,620
we would miss this spring.

514
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,620
I am content to have a little acquaintance

515
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,620
for the sake of the future.

516
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Never call me for anything else.

517
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,620
As long as one goal continues to be achieved,

518
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,620
there are too much pressure on the progress.

519
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
You should go do it.

520
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,620
That's right.

521
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
If you want to be free,

522
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
You've messed up the spring cakes.

523
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
It doesn't look like your cooking.

524
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
This is the spring cakes from the villagers.

525
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Don't waste it.

526
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
Here, taste it.

527
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
It tastes good.

528
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,620
But I want to eat the midnight snack made by my wife.

529
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,620
I've been busy for half a day and now I'm in a hurry.

530
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
Not to mention the baked pancakes.

531
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
I'm tired right now and I can't wait to go to bed.

532
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
You're so busy.

533
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Why don't you stay longer?

534
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
You've been working so hard.

535
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
I haven't seen you for a few days.

536
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
I want to come back and see you soon.

537
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Then I'll satisfy your small wish.

538
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
Enough, stop it.

539
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Did you go back to your home and come straight to me?

540
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
You're sweating so much.

541
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
You should wipe it off.

542
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
How is it going over there?

543
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Is it hard these days?

544
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
I'm back home.

545
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
I know you're waiting for me.

546
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
So it's not hard at all.

547
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
You've been working hard.

548
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,620
Do you want to go to the pool with me?

549
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
To wash your hair and get rid of the hair.

550
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
My husband goes first.

551
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
I have something for you.

552
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
I'll find you later.

553
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
I have everything.

554
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
It's always sunset that makes us meet.

555
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
I can't bear to be separated from you.

556
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
I'm tired.

557
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Be good.

558
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
You can't eat this.

559
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
Come on.

560
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Let me take you to eat fish.

561
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Fish isn't as poors as cat.

562
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
Why do you eat a cat's food?

563
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Okay.

564
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
I'll go find you when I finish my task.

565
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
Bye.

566
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,100
I'm on my way.

567
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,620
This is the shirt I made for you.

568
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Try it on later.

569
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
Does it fit?

570
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Yuxian Ling

571
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
said he wanted to persuade a gardener to raise chickens.

572
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
But he can't change the widow to a king.

573
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
He doesn't know who to ask to do this business.

574
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
I want to let everyone see themselves.

575
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
If you want to do this business,

576
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
you can come to Chang'an to study for a few days.

577
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Everyone competes by their skills.

578
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
If you learn well,

579
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
you can imitate me and Xiaochun

580
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
and work together.

581
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Sign a contract. What do you think?

582
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
You are sisters.

583
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,620
It doesn't mean that others don't have a private heart.

584
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
You are right.

585
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
Some people are diligent, some people are lazy.

586
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
If you are in a separation,

587
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
you will have a fight.

588
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,620
I can ask Yuxian Ling to find someone to supervise.

589
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
The contract doesn't need to be signed for too long.

590
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
It can be signed for half a year.

591
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
If it doesn't work, we can change the person.

592
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
I finally have a free life.

593
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,620
Can't you rest?

594
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
You are sorry?

595
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
I want you to leave a little space for yourself.

596
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Raise your head and enjoy the moon.

597
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
You have a good rest.

598
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
You will have more energy to work tomorrow.

599
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620
It's so good to have you.

600
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
You mean the one in the sky

601
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
or the one beside you?

602
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
What do you think?

603
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
I don't know.

604
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,620
I don't know.

605
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,620
I don't know.

606
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
I don't know.

607
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I don't know.

608
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
I don't know.

609
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
I don't know.

610
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
I don't know.

611
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
I don't know.

612
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I don't know.

613
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
I don't know.

614
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
I don't know.

615
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,620
I don't know.

616
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
I don't know.

617
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I don't remember

618
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
everything.

619
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
I asked to learn a magic trick,

620
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
to remove the star from the sky.

621
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
Really?

622
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Count three, you will get the star.

623
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,620
Great!

624
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
Okay.

625
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,260
This is a magic trick made by Chuan Yu, right?

626
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
Wrong.

627
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
It's a snake's snake.

628
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,860
No, no, no.

629
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,780
You're so busy today.

630
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,580
And you need to help me prepare this?

631
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
Did you do something bad behind my back?

632
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,220
You're right.

633
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,620
I didn't have the courage to let you work so hard for me.

635
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,620
I want to make up for the past mistakes.

636
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,620
Okay, okay.

637
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
I'm very generous.

638
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
I don't remember the past.

639
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
In the future, we will never part.

640
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
We will never part.

641
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
We have seen the fireworks twice.

642
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,620
And we have seen the fireflies again.

643
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
And we have seen the fireflies again.

644
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
I always make you sad.

645
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
I have to pay you back.

646
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,620
So, in the future, as long as you see the fireflies again,

647
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
you will only remember the words of tonight.

648
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,620
This time it's Chuan Yu, right?

649
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Madam, it's good to know.

650
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
Chuan Yu has been working hard for a day.

651
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
Let her go back and rest.

652
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,620
How do you know?

653
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,620
Chuan Yu wants to see the fireworks with you.

654
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Look at you.

655
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,620
It's okay.

656
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Chuan Yu, you're here.

657
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:32,620
owanezka

658
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Zhang Qian.

659
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,140
Zhang Qian!

660
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Congratulations, Zhang Qian!

661
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,620
You're the first one, Zhang Qian!

662
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,780
Congratulations, Zhang Qian!

663
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,540
Congratulations, Zhang Qian!

664
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,140
Congratulations!

665
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,420
On the day of the uprising,

666
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,140
Zhang Qian was the leader.

667
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,700
He could lead the students to the fire of Liao Yuan

668
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,620
with his sharp and sharp sword.

669
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,780
Zhang Qian was thoughtful,

670
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,060
talented and righteous.

671
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,180
Your Majesty,

672
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,500
have you ever thought of giving him a reward?

673
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,100
I've only met him once.

674
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,060
So I'm in a hurry to ask for his approval.

675
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,840
어� warumtechno

676
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,420
What?!

677
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,180
What design do you create, master?!

678
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,620
false

679
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,060
Anyway,

680
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,900
Lord Zhang went to Liao Yuan

681
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,620
to collect summer flowers

682
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,100
with the archaeology.

683
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,340
Master Zhang had no regret since he died.

684
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,700
Now those you have

685
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
I'll leave it to you.

686
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

687
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
You're welcome.

688
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Minister Zhang of the Ministry of War is always cautious.

689
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,700
How did he get the evidence of his corruption?

690
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
He has a deep love for the fourth son of Laolai De.

691
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,700
And Zhang Silang is close to the son of the Si Nong family.

692
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
He can say anything when he's drunk.

693
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Minister Zhang has raised five concubines.

694
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:12,700
He has hidden all the accounts and the stolen goods in the most unloved concubines' house.

695
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,700
What a good game!

696
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
You're so patient.

697
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,700
As long as we want to see the private shadow of the corrupt officials,

698
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,700
we can't find it.

699
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
The End
