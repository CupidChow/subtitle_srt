00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,030
In the Name of Blossom

3
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,960

4
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,659
What's wrong, Mu Dan? Did you cut your hand?

5
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,400
Let me see.

6
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,420
It's okay. It will be fine soon.

7
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,260
Is this an auspicious cloud
you're carving? It's so intricate.

8
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,740
It needs a bit more refining.

9
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,719
Once it's done, this auspicious cloud

10
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,900
can be printed
on the sachets for gifts, symbolizing good luck.

11
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,560
I never knew you could carve stamps.

12
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,360
My mother taught me.

13
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,639
Mu Dan, you have turned
the Fragrance Garden into a riot of color.

14
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,379
Your mother would be very proud of you.

15
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,700
If I can't personally take revenge on the enemy,
how can I live up to my mother's expectations?

16
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,059
Jiang Chang Yang came today looking for you.

17
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:43,759
Liu Lang sent him away,
saying that you didn't feel like seeing guests.

18
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,440
I thought that after spending so much time together,

19
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,060
I understood him well enough.

20
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,779
I knew Mr. Wu meant a lot to him,

21
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,900
but I didn't expect that in matters of principle,

22
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,140
he would actually defend a murderer.

23
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,920
I don't understand.

24
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,059
I'm surprised as well. Perhaps Jiang Chang Yang
is just protective of his loved ones.

25
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,970
He had always treated us well,

26
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,040
and over time, we forgot that he was the Floral Envoy,

27
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,900
a corrupt official with a notorious reputation.

28
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,299
I forgot. He is best at acting.

29
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,300
Let the past be the past.
Mr. Wu is also a pitiable person.

30
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,120
Mu Dan, let it go.

31
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,120
All these years, Mr. Wu has lived a frugal life.
He has been atoning for his sins.

32
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,620
- Ms. He.
 - Mr. Wu,

33
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,079
no need to say anything.

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,179
Not just Jiang Chang Yang,
why was Mr. Wu so calm when he saw me?

35
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,419
As if he had already anticipated
that I would come to find him.

36
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,419
And Mother, why did she never mention this to me?

37
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,140
There is a big difference
between the symptoms of poisoning and disease.

38
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,580
You must truthfully inform the doctor
to receive the right treatment.

39
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,739
In past medical consultations,
Father and Mother always sent me away.

40
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,480
No, I must find out the truth.

41
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
Mu Dan,

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,940
I have checked everything you asked me to investigate.

43
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,419
Since returning from Luoyang to Chang'an,
Mr. Wu has stayed at the orphanage infirmary.

44
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,399
He only comes into contact with those children.

45
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,620
He has no other friends or family around now.

46
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,680
What are you writing?

47
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,720
This is the list of names and approximate ages
of all the children living in the orphanage.

48
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,560
For a few, I only know their nicknames.

49
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,120
You'll need to ask the long-term residents
of the nearby village.

50
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,859
Why are you investigating these children?

51
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:34,219
I want to know if any of these children
came from Luoyang.

52
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,859
Kang. Kang.

53
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,439
Kang usually comes here to play every day.
Why is he not here today?

54
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,760
- Stop. You, stop.
- Are you Kang?

55
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,199
- Where did you get hit? Does it hurt?
 - I'm fine.

56
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,959
- Let go of me.
- Come here.

57
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,539
- Let go of me.
- He is Kang.

58
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,700
What kind of hero attacks from behind?

59
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,960
- Let go.
- Don't move.

60
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,540
Stand here now.

61
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
- Give it back to me.
 - No, I won't.

62
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,439
Kang, I have a question.

63
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,720
Usually, you're very well-behaved and polite.
Why did you hit me today?

64
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,839
And you hit her so hard, despite the fact
that Mu Dan often sends you clothes and food.

65
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,419
Heartless.

66
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:24,739
You're a bad person.

67
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't send anything.
I don't want your stuff anymore.

68
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,940
Let go. Let me go.

69
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,060
Why do you say that?

70
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,140
I saw you trying to harm Mr. Wu.

71
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,739
You are a big villain.

72
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,779
How do you know Mr. Wu is not the villain?

73
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,480
Mr. Wu is a very good person. He saved my life.

74
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,900
Slow down, slow down.

75
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,779
You have a fever from tuberculosis. Speak slowly.

76
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,280
Have some water, here.

77
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,160
- What are you doing?
 - I don't need your kindness.

78
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,839
If it weren't for Mr. Wu,
I would have died in the flood that year.

79
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,020
If you want to harm him, you are my enemy.

80
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,539
Kang, are you talking about the flood disaster
in Luoyang four years ago?

81
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,659
Are you really from Luoyang?

82
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,519
I am.

83
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:22,060
Back then, many people caught the plague,
and few in the village survived.

84
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:30,979
My parents and my sister
couldn't survive, only I did.

85
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,360
By that time, Mr. Wu's family had all passed away.

86
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,020
He luckily got the medicine,
but it was already too late.

87
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,060
By chance, he met me and gave me the medicine.

88
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,539
That's how I was able to save my life.

89
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,639
So many people died in that epidemic.

90
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,220
Kang, tell me, where did Mr. Wu find the medicine?

91
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,179
Mr. Wu said he found it in a merchant's house.

92
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,000
Was the merchant's surname He?

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Mr. Wu didn't say, but it's definitely not.

94
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,779
Why are you so sure?

95
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,860
Back then, the plague was not incurable.

96
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,759
But the medicine was expensive
and required rare peony bark.

97
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,659
It's said that the He's pharmacy in the city
had such peony bark.

98
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,000
But the pharmacy owner
took the opportunity to drive up the prices

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,220
and sold all the peony bark to noble families.

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,020
Could you be mistaken?

101
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,179
I remember it very clearly.

102
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:48,360
Back then, my parents, I, and the whole village
knelt outside the pharmacy for several days.

103
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,120
But we were told
that all the peony bark was used up.

104
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,179
But I clearly saw them carrying
medicinal packets onto the carriage.

105
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,779
The packets were extremely beautiful.

106
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,220
Tell me, what pattern was printed
on the medicinal packets?

107
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,679
It was clouds, red clouds.

108
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,020
I also hoped my parents
could have a pack of clouds.

109
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:20,520
But even until they died kneeling
at the pharmacy's door, no one cared.

110
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,519
The people in the village
also collapsed one by one.

111
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,559
The open space in the back hill
could no longer accommodate.

112
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,059
Too many people died, too many.

113
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,389
Mr. Wu said that the peony owner
turned a blind eye to death,

114
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,659
so the peony bark she had
was no different from poison.

115
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:44,000
It wasn't a natural disaster that killed everyone.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,340
The He family pharmacy
is the murderous demon and our enemy.

117
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,639
Don't talk nonsense, child. Don't talk nonsense.

118
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,299
I'm not talking nonsense.

119
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,099
Stop talking.

120
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,859
Kang, after Mr. Wu saved you all those years ago,
why did you come to Chang'an?

121
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,020
Big Brother brought us here.

122
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,020
It was Jiang Chang Yang.

123
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,299
Mr. Wu fed me the medicine.

124
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:39,820
At night, I woke up groggy
and saw that he had hanged himself.

125
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,639
Mr. Wu.

126
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,220
Big Brother arrived in time and saved him.

127
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
Sir.

128
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,380
That night, Mr. Wu cried for a long time,
and Big Brother persuaded him for a long time.

129
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,579
Big Brother told me that from then on,
I would be Mr. Wu's son.

130
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,559
Only if the brothers and sisters
in the courtyard are safe and sound,

131
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,320
can Mr. Wu live well.

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,360
The root and bark of this flower can clear heat,
cool the blood, and alleviate various pains.

133
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,740
Combined with anemarrhena, phellodendron,
and rehmannia, it can relieve lung heat.

134
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,020
It is exactly the medicine
most needed for this epidemic.

135
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,819
The ice crystal peonies we have are the rarest
and hardest to find over vast distances.

136
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:43,860
In these times of disaster,
one of these is worth a fortune.

137
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,959
I grew up by my mother's side.

138
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:52,160
I know her character very well.

139
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,440
She is definitely not such a heartless person.

140
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
Could there be any misunderstanding in this?

141
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,620
My mother understands pharmacology.

142
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,740
If someone poisoned her,
she would definitely notice.

143
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,870
But she never mentioned it until her last breath.

144
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,200
So why would Auntie know about it?

145
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,919
I need to return to Luoyang.

146
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,979
Coming.

147
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,779
What? Can't I enter this house anymore?

148
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,720
Mu Dan, what are you doing?

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,699
Wasn't our deal settled in Chang'an?
Are you going back on your word?

150
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,559
I came to Luoyang to find my father.

151
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,240
It has nothing to do with you, so step aside.

152
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,579
If you have severed ties with the He family,
you should behave yourself.

153
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:49,600
Please stop looking for the Master, will you?

154
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,300
Mu Dan?

155
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,200
It really is you. Why didn't you
send a letter before coming home?

156
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,620
- That's… That's right.
- Hurry, come on in.

157
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,519
Why bring the past matter up now?

158
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,380
You only told me that Mother suddenly fell ill.

159
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,579
No one told me that it was due to poisoning.

160
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,860
How could you think so, Mu Dan?
Your mother was not…

161
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,759
Father, there's no need
to hide it anymore. I already know.

162
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,519
It was Wu Hong's doing.

163
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,119
How did you…

164
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:46,000
When you said you were visiting home,
you actually went to Chang'an to see Mu Dan.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,620
Are you blaming me?

166
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,279
Have you seen the house? We're almost emptied out.

167
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,080
Since Mu Dan is a He family daughter,
what's wrong with helping the family?

168
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,440
Why did you act on your own?

169
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,699
Mu Dan, I didn't know
that it was your money and silk.

170
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,600
In two years, within two years,
I will definitely pay you back.

171
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,679
Pay her back? Why would you?

172
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,500
Shut up.

173
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,679
As a He family daughter,
Mu Dan is obligated to support her parents.

174
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,960
Moreover, she is now wealthy.

175
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,919
You haven't seen it.

176
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,340
She is thriving as a shop owner.

177
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,960
Such a small amount of money
is hardly noticeable to her.

178
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,259
- Shut your mouth.
- I…

179
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,879
Father, I did not come today to ask for money.

180
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,539
If Auntie didn't tell me, I couldn't find out
about what happened back then.

181
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,759
How much have you found out?

182
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,919
A lot.

183
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:09,240
When the plague ravaged Luoyang back then,
Mother's ice crystal peonies could save lives.

184
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,259
Father, did you sell the peony bark
to high officials back then?

185
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,440
I've been thinking on my way here.

186
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,220
How could the parents I have admired
and loved since childhood

187
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,380
be such greedy people
who ignore others' suffering?

188
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,200
No, you cannot speak of your mother like that.

189
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,360
She was not aware of this matter.

190
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,399
What do you mean?

191
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,360
I was the one who sold
the peony bark at a high price.

192
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Your mother did not know
the destination of those medicinal materials.

193
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,960
I told her I distributed them
to the infected common people.

194
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,060
Why?

195
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,900
Was it just to make more money
amidst the natural disaster?

196
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,720
At that time, the plague was fierce,
and high officials were all in panic.

197
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,200
They forced me to sell all the medicine to them.

198
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,220
But after the flood that year,
the common people's water and food were polluted,

199
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,340
which caused the epidemic.

200
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,779
The nobles stayed in their houses all day,

201
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:26,200
eating precious and clean food.

202
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,679
How could they easily get sick?

203
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,059
Those nobles didn't care about that.

204
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,879
If one or two of their servants

205
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:38,140
who went out to purchase goods fell ill,
they were terrified.

206
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,799
They needed to have hundreds of doses
of medicine at home to feel at ease.

207
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,920
Even though they were healthy,
they hoarded medicine and refused to save lives.

208
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,499
Father, I can't believe you agreed to this deal.

209
00:17:54,499 --> 00:18:00,240
As a mere merchant, if I had angered the powerful,

210
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,599
they would have closed down all our shops.

211
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,979
At that time, you and your mother
would also be implicated.

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,259
Mu Dan, I didn't dare to take the risk.

213
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,710
So at that time,

214
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,270
you kept it from us.

215
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,820
Your mother is kind and gentle,
only focused on flowers and plants.

216
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,240
And you were young.

217
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,979
Telling you about this
would only add to your worries.

218
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:39,839
I cannot bear to let you
and your mother suffer with me.

219
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,680
So, Mother

220
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,580
later found out.

221
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,219
Wu Hong told her.

222
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,620
 After the calamity subsided, someone disguised
as a vegetable farmer sneaked into the house.

223
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,760
 Your mother sympathized with him
and gave him some food and money.

224
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,419
 That person was Wu Hong.

225
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,459
How did it come to this?

226
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:15,319
If the medicine is taken on time,
recovery should come in a few days.

227
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,780
This expensive medicine
can only be afforded by the wealthy.

228
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,200
How can lowly people like us afford it?

229
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,699
He's pharmacy's peony bark was free,
with no distinction between noble and common.

230
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,950
Free?

231
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:40,400
Madam, are you truly unaware
of the price of this medicine?

232
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,240
Was my peony bark sold
at a high price to sick people?

233
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,540
If it can be bought at a high price, it'd be fine.

234
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,359
Your medicine would not
be sold to ordinary people at all.

235
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,659
Instead, it was delivered
to the mansions of high officials and nobles.

236
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,960
How could this be?

237
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,599
This life-saving medicine is hard to obtain,
and it's a perfect opportunity to make a fortune.

238
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,119
It seems that Storekeeper He
did not tell you the truth either.

239
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,619
- Outside…
 - Outside, corpses are scattered everywhere.

240
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,960
Half a month ago, people were indeed
kneeling in front of He's Pharmacy.

241
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,640
From dawn till dusk, they kowtowed continuously,
only asking for a packet of medicine.

242
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,160
But now those who sought medicine
have long passed away.

243
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:37,359
Among those unjust spirits are my whole family.

244
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,240
In the past half month,
I wandered around the mansions of the nobles.

245
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,960
Yet no one paid any attention to me.

246
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,440
If Storekeeper He were home today,
he would probably drive me away, too.

247
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,319
By a twist of fate, I happened to encounter you.

248
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,880
I poisoned the tea, Madam.
Report it to the authorities.

249
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,799
Whether to kill or flay, I am at your disposal.

250
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,469
Fate plays tricks.

251
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:35,540
I wanted to avenge my family,

252
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:42,179
but little did I know that as the source
of the medicine, you were unaware of this.

253
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,200
You don't need to find someone
to capture me. I will not run.

254
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Now I am all alone
and have no intention of clinging to life.

255
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,540
This is the last bit
of the ice crystal peony root bark.

256
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:21,200
I'm not sure if anyone
still needs it at this moment.

257
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:25,179
Madam, what are you doing?

258
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,900
You should leave.

259
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,599
Aren't you going to report it to the authorities?

260
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,124
 ♫ The Luo River cleanses the moonlight ♫

261
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:57,027
 ♫ Flowing into a scorching long river ♫

262
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:02,339
 ♫ The jade visage never consented
to the mundane world ♫

263
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:10,152
 ♫ Youth itself determines the path of wandering ♫

264
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:14,627
 ♫ Do not let the mortal world lock it ♫

265
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,795
 ♫ Why follow the arbitrary guesses
of the common eye ♫

266
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:24,391
 ♫ Smile at the winds and rains stirring the dust ♫

267
00:23:24,391 --> 00:23:30,142
 ♫ Flowers should bloom proudly Reflecting the color of the sky ♫

268
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,543
 ♫ Without withering ♫

269
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,190
It turns out that the big fire back then
was not an accident.

270
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,200
Mother set it.

271
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,240
Your mother urged me to keep it from you.

272
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,459
But I knew that one day you would find out.

273
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:58,610

274
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,659
Father, I want to discuss something with you.

275
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,720
I plan to find the surviving family and relatives
of those who died from illness back then.

276
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,259
If they need assistance,
I'll do my utmost to help them.

277
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,720
I will also list the names of the deceased
to properly build tombs and monuments for them.

278
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,759
Let me handle it.

279
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,730
You were unaware back then,

280
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,170
and as your father, I feel ashamed.

281
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:52,980
You were trying to protect Mother and me.
You don't need to apologize to me.

282
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,960
Moreover, I am also a member of the He family,
so I should make amends to those who suffered.

283
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,440
I think it's what Mother would have wanted.

284
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,419
Mu Dan, I know you are smart and capable.

285
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:16,060
But as a woman,
you shouldn't worry about these things.

286
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,340
There is much suffering in the world,
and it's hard for women to bear it.

287
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,079
You ventured alone
into Chang'an and suffered a lot.

288
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:29,860
Fortunately, you married into the Jiang family
and found a good husband.

289
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,200
Although Jiang Chang Yang does not have
a good reputation, he is still of noble birth.

290
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,440
He can ensure that you do not
suffer or get bullied.

291
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,340
Now you need to look forward
and manage household affairs well.

292
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,039
Serve your husband and ensure
the continuation of the lineage.

293
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:53,659
Seek honor and favor.
Only then can you achieve lasting happiness.

294
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,440
Father, I am talking about making amends with you.

295
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,119
Yet you talk to me about how competing for favor
within the household can bring happiness.

296
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,180
- You are a woman, and this is your destiny.
 - Father,

297
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,559
when I fled from the Liu Mansion
and returned home late at night,

298
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,719
did you know why I didn't enter the house
and instead went straight to Chang'an?

299
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:23,279
Because when the Liu family
came to look for me back then,

300
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,599
I was nearby, and I overheard your conversation.

301
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,979
You said yourself
a woman's only destination is marriage.

302
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:37,979
If you found me, you would certainly
send me back to the Liu family.

303
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,480
In your heart,

304
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,140
marrying into the Liu family was my great honor,

305
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,599
and leaving my husband was a disgrace to myself.

306
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:51,959
I… I didn't know at the time
that the Liu family intended to take your life, I…

307
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:05,359
Mu Dan, you are different now than before.

308
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,259
How different?

309
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:12,179
You are now Jiang Chang Yang's concubine.

310
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,380
It was a mistake on my part back then.

311
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,820
Now I hear that Jiang is very fond of you,
and that he doesn't have an official wife.

312
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,480
You should work hard
and not repeat the mistake with the Liu family.

313
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,510
Father,

314
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,390
you have always loved and protected me.

315
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:41,399
Yet meanwhile, you look down on me.

316
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,419
When I escaped from the Liu family,
I faked my own death and changed my identity.

317
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:56,019
I worked hard in business, just to avoid living a life confined to the house and depending on others.

318
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:00,100
Mu Dan, it's not as simple as you think.

319
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,699
You have no idea how difficult it is
to run a business and support a family,

320
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:08,559
especially when you are a woman.

321
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,839
You must know that your ability
to act and speak like this now

322
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,499
is all because Jiang Chang Yang has your back.

323
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:17,300
Do you really think this way?

324
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,459
In your eyes, a woman can only rely on a man.

325
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:25,779
At least he can make things
a bit easier for you, right?

326
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,060
Maybe you see

327
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,200
Mother as just a woman
who knows only gardening.

328
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,659
But in my heart, she is the most
courageous and capable woman.

329
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,540

330
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,979
she cared about the disaster victims
and made medicinal packets with peony bark.

331
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:59,599
In the most painful times,

332
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,240
she burned her beloved peony bushes
to refuse to be corrupted by the powerful.

333
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:13,079
It was Mother who taught me that in this world,
women can have another way of life.

334
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,660
And Father, I understand that back then,

335
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,630
for the sake of this family, you had no choice but to set aside your dignity

336
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,939
and make a deal with the powerful people.

337
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:33,079
I can understand even more that you want
to pass on the family line for our ancestry,

338
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:38,079
so you had to choose Man Er
and put your daughter second.

339
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,540
But up to this day,

340
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,939
you have never truly understood
what kind of women Mother and I are.

341
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:52,100
What my heart desires is something
you cannot understand.

342
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:58,419
Therefore, I cannot do what you ask of me.

343
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:02,460
Mu Dan, why are you so willful?

344
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,200
Everything I do is for your own good.

345
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,459
As for how to establish oneself
in the world as a woman,

346
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:16,780
I have already made up my mind.

347
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,140
It's getting late. I should head back now.

348
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,380
So that Auntie won't be unhappy.

349
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,580
I thought you'd stay a few more days.

350
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,459
No, there are still many things to do in Chang'an.

351
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,490
Father,

352
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,060
you are getting on in years.
You don't need to worry much about the pharmacy.

353
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,459
I have already sent someone with money and silk.
They should arrive within two days.

354
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:53,839
This money and silk should be enough
to help the He family start afresh.

355
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,320
From now on,

356
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,380
Father can live comfortably
in Luoyang with Man Er and Auntie.

357
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,919
I will always remember
your kindness in raising me.

358
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:37,019
As for my own matters, I will handle them myself.

359
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,359
Please rest assured, Father.

360
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:01,900
Mu Dan, why not eat before you go back?

361
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,259
Father, I want to eat Hu cakes.

362
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,759
Okay, I will make it for you.

363
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,419
No, Father, please take care of yourself.

364
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,279
Mr. Jiang, Ms. He has returned.

365
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,380
So soon? I thought she would stay
in Luoyang for a few more days.

366
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,060
Fu said that as soon as Ms. He returned
to the Fragrance Garden, she sent the guests away,

367
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,380
closed the doors early
and was completely distraught.

368
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,640
She knows everything.

369
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,600
 I also hoped my parents
could have a pack of clouds.

370
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,739
 But even until they died kneeling
at the pharmacy's door, no one cared.

371
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,839
The people in the village
also collapsed one by one.

372
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,799
The open space in the back hill
could no longer accommodate.

373
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,380
Too many people died, too many.

374
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,759
Mr. Wu said that the peony owner
turned a blind eye to death,

375
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,939
so the peony bark she had
was no different from poison.

376
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:09,340
The He family pharmacy is the murderous demon

377
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,659
 and our enemy.

378
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,000
Mu Dan.

379
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,719
When did you find out?

380
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,380
I just learned about this from Mr. Wu
before you went to see him.

381
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,140
During the flood four years ago,
he had never seen you.

382
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,360
He didn't know you were the daughter
of Shopkeeper He of Luoyang.

383
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:32,419
His acquaintance with you before
was out of appreciation for you.

384
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,700
But he did harm your mother,

385
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,360
so you have every right to hate him.

386
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,820
Does it still hurt?

387
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,740
I know you stopped me
from killing Mr. Wu for my sake.

388
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,180
You feared I would learn
the brutal truth from four years ago.

389
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,040
And you're even more afraid
that when I find out about the flood incident,

390
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,419
I'll regret my previous impulsive actions.

391
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,999
I'm sorry.

392
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:36,740
There's no need for these words between us.

393
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,879
But these words can never be heard
by Mother or those who died four years ago.

394
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,660
As a pharmacist,

395
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,539
Father couldn't protect Mother and me
if he didn't submit to those in power.

396
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,930
As a beneficiary,

397
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,160
I have no right to criticize him.

398
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:12,939
But those common people
who died of illness did nothing wrong.

399
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:19,880
I was determined to uncover the truth
and avenge my mother.

400
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,870
But in the end,

401
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:30,560
I found that there was
no one to hate and no revenge to seek.

402
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,420
I always believed that by doing these things,

403
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,550
I could bring beauty and fragrance to others.

404
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,130
Little did I know

405
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,920
there were so many others,

406
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,059
struggling to survive, let alone enjoying flowers.

407
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,959
Heaven and earth are unkind,
and the world is bleak.

408
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:06,620
Suddenly, I don't know how to be
a good merchant anymore.

409
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,530
Even if I became the top flower merchant,

410
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,540
what is the point of it all?

411
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:32,979
Mu Dan, since you started your business,

412
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:37,900
you have never earned ill-gotten gains
or done anything against your conscience.

413
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,119
You reopened the Fragrance Garden,

414
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,220
giving those homeless women who had no one
something to depend on.

415
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,459
How can that be pointless?

416
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,619
I've trapped myself in this small space,
unable to see the true face of the world.

417
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:03,740
What truly is the way of doing business?

418
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,590
I can't figure it out anymore.

419
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,910
I'm confused.

420
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,220
Is there anything left?

421
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,660
The accounts for this month have been settled.

422
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,619
All the goods have been paid for,
except for the last order to be delivered.

423
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,419
Fu, Chun, you will join me when the time comes.

424
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,419
I have summarized
everyone's skills and work experience.

425
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:29,099
Madam Tang, after I leave,

426
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,300

427
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,740
Make sure that everyone
has a suitable position in the branch.

428
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,660
When transferred to work in the shop,

429
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,820
if everyone still wishes to live
in the Fragrance Garden, it is also fine.

430
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,839
Mu Dan, what are you doing?

431
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:52,479
After delivering this last order,
Fragrance Garden will temporarily close.

432
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,860
The contracts for Huamanzhu and Qingshuzhai,
as well as the pawnshop receipts, are all inside.

433
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,019
Ms. Sun, it will be left to you
for safekeeping in the future.

434
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:11,700
In the future, with you managing
this shop, I am at ease.

435
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,419
Huamanzhu and Fragrance Garden
are both famous throughout the capital.

436
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:18,419
Are you willing to give up
all your efforts and achievements?

437
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:22,039
Yes, Mu Dan, have you really thought this through?

438
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:26,459
Through this incident, I have reflected a lot.

439
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:30,320
The once-firm obsessions
and grand aspirations have all become vague.

440
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,660
Even if I forcibly keep going,
it's still meaningless.

441
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,820
I need to clear my thoughts
and figure out the true meaning

442
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,800
of doing business.

443
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:45,970

444
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,840
Mr. Jiang, it's the hour of Wei.
There are important matters later.

445
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
Let's go.

446
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,710

447
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:29,700

00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:34,230
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

461
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:42,492
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

462
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:50,748
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

463
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:59,176
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

464
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:07,076
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
