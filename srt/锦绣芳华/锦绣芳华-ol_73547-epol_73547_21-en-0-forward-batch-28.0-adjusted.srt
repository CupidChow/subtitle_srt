1
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:08,000

2
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,200
How can you, alone, kill me?

3
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,159
Sui Zhi's hidden guards are all over the city,
and I have already joined them.

4
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,120
Right now, several crossbows are aimed here
from the buildings outside the window.

5
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,119
As soon as I drop this wine as a signal,
countless arrows will fly through the window.

6
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
My target is Liu Chang.

7
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,320
Leave now and I won't harm innocent bystanders.

8
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,199
Do you think I'd believe that?

9
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,039
Mr. Liu, our men are blocking the streets.

10
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,080
We didn't check the shops
on the second floor surrounding us.

11
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Useless!

12
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:04,120
Fine! Since you're so eager to die
with Liu Chang, I'll grant your wish.

13
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,000
Wait! Mr. Liu, this isn't His Highness's order.

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,280
We can't die here without cause. Please spare us!

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Move out!

16
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,839
Go ahead and smash it! Let's see if you dare!

17
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,399
Liu Chang, it seems you truly don't fear death.

18
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,919
If what you say is true,

19
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,039
I'll die here today anyway.

20
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,960
Why not perish together with you?

21
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,320
Even in the afterlife, I'll make sure
you and Jiang Chang Yang suffer.

22
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,599
But if you're bluffing,

23
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,279
I'll need to reconsider
what chains to bind you with.

24
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
Liu Chang, do you think I won't kill you?

25
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,639
Your legs aren't the only thing crippled.
Your soul has rotted too.

26
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,479
Now you're no different
from Prince Ning and Liu Shen.

27
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,279
You've all become shameless villains
soaked in sin.

28
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,640
So what?

29
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,280
He Wei Fang, I'm the victor here.
You're the captive.

30
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Need I mention Jiang Chang Yang
rotting in the mud?

31
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,999
I gave you a chance. Don't push me.

32
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,439
Liu Chang, do you really think you've won?

33
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,439
You wanted to bring honor
to your ancestors and rise above others.

34
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,439
But look at you now,
just a dog licking its master's hand.

35
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,439
Shut up!

36
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,839
Even if you drag me back today,

37
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,879
every moment after this
I'll think of ways to kill you.

38
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,999
I told you to shut up! You think I won't do it?

39
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,600
Liu Chang, you can't take me away.

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,639
Liu Chang, stop!

41
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
Get up.

42
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,239
Xiao Xue Xi?

43
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,480
This matter has nothing to do with you.
I advise you not to interfere.

44
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,879
Mu Dan is my closest friend.
I will ensure her safety.

45
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,399
She's family of a rebel.
Do you understand the consequences of taking her?

46
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,959
You still remember she's someone's family?

47
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,399
I'll personally report today's events
to His Highness.

48
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,199
You, a mere live-in son-in-law,

49
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,439
dare explain to His Highness why you hid Mu Dan
and mobilized troops without permission?

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Let's go.

51
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,639
With the capital in chaos,
my father initially forbade me from coming.

52
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,960
But I fear for your safety.

53
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,840
No one will dare harm you again.

54
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,160
If you're sad, let yourself cry freely.

55
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Tears are useless.
I have more important matters to attend to.

56
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,160
Xue Xi, how did you know I was at Huanyun Tower?

57
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,319
I failed Mr. Jiang's trust and lost track of you.

58
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,040
For causing your imprisonment and suffering,
I deserve death ten thousand times over.

59
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,480
Rise quickly, Chuan Yu. See? I'm perfectly fine.

60
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
Come on, stand up.

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,199
But I couldn't save Mr. Jiang,
couldn't protect She Yan either.

62
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,960
Many perished on the day of uprising,
yet I shamefully survive.

63
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,959
Stand! Stand and speak properly.

64
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,800
All of you rise! Get up quickly now!

65
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,199
Xue Xi has told me everything.

66
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,480
You gathered hidden guards
to search the city for me.

67
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,879
You spotted the palace lantern in time
and alerted Xue Xi to rescue me.

68
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,679
I will never forget your lifesaving kindness.

69
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,800
If Jiang Chang Yang knew of this,
he would surely thank all of you.

70
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,879
With Mr. Jiang deceased, we've lost our employer.

71
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,319
Henceforth, I wish to follow you,
awaiting your commands.

72
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,999
We wish to serve you, at your disposal.

73
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,999
Mu Dan, the current situation remains unclear.

74
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,679
It's too dangerous staying in Chang'an.
Come with me to Hexi instead.

75
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,240
Your Highness, this Lady He is full of schemes.
We shouldn't let the tiger return to its mountain.

76
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,040
A mere widow without her husband,
what trouble could she possibly stir?

77
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:20,879
Those Military Governors are cunning foxes,
constantly gauging circumstances.

78
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,599
Only the Xiao family agreed to stamp the covenant.

79
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,679
Hexi shares my vital interests.
We mustn't offend them before achieving our goals.

80
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
But Your Highness...

81
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,120
Don't imagine I don't know
what schemes brew in your mind.

82
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,520
I wouldn't dare.

83
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,640
Our immediate priority is securing the throne.

84
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
The Ministry of Revenue and national treasury
are already under our control.

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,319
The challenge lies in winning over
those wavering Military Governors.

86
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
I needn't instruct you further on this, do I?

87
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,000
I understand.

88
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,960
Your pulse is strong,
with no internal or external injuries.

89
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,879
I told you a lucky star protects Mu Dan.
All's well that ends well.

90
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,440
Look how worried you all are.
I kept saying I was fine.

91
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,600
Is everyone alright?
Has anyone else been implicated?

92
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Don't worry. Merchants like us
are beneath the notice of those nobles.

93
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Liu Chang only investigated us while searching
for you, but caused no real trouble.

94
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,639
What about my cousin? How is he?

95
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,279
Li Xing struggles at court these days,
barely keeping his head above water.

96
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,939
At least his life isn't in immediate danger.

97
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,400
Hearing you're safe, he insisted
I remind you to take great care.

98
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,440
Safe and sound is enough.

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,639
Mu Dan, everything's been arranged
exactly as you instructed in your letter.

100
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,519
Liu Lang, Madam Tang, and Ms. Sun

101
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,919
all remain in Chang'an managing the shops.

102
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:55,120
Our floriculturists from the Fragrance Garden
are all working there with my father now.

103
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,559
As for us, we will stand by you
through thick and thin.

104
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't think you can leave us behind
with just a letter.

105
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,759
Having you in this life is my greatest fortune.

106
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,279
But this journey is perilous
with unpredictable life-or-death risks.

107
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't want to drag you into this.

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,399
We're not afraid.

109
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,880
We're sworn siblings who vowed
to entrust our lives to each other.

110
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,240
Moreover, the more dangerous it gets,
the more we need medical expertise.

111
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,120
It took us ages to convince others
to let just the two of us accompany you.

112
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,440
How could those staying in Chang'an
feel at ease if we don't go?

113
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Exactly.

114
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,519
Alright. Let's go together.
I'll protect you with my life.

115
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,600
All three of us will go and return together,
not a single one left behind.

116
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,799
Alright.

117
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,279
We'll protect each other
and stay together forever.

118
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,240
Never apart.

119
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
Never apart.

120
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,544
Fu, there's actually a fourth person
joining our journey.

121
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,439
Look.

122
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,279
Chuan Yu?

123
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,960
Are you alright?

124
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,800
Are you hurt? Let me check.

125
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,479
Mu Dan, are you absolutely certain about this?

126
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,520
If you return to Hexi with me,
I'll ensure your lifelong safety and comfort.

127
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,759
A person lives but once.
I only seek to live without regrets.

128
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,240
I hope you can help conceal my whereabouts.

129
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:48,319
Don't worry. Everyone will believe
you stayed in Hexi with me.

130
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,839
Take good care of yourself.

131
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,479
Stay safe.

132
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,520
I never realized Sui Zhi carried
so much in his heart.

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,559
He suffered too much.

134
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:19,679
He finally found such a wonderful wife,
only to be separated forever by life and death.

135
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,520
And I didn't even get to see him one last time.

136
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,840
Aunt, Sui Zhi sacrificed himself
for righteousness.

137
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Though there's regret, his heart knew no remorse.

138
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,600
The departed are gone.
The living must grow stronger.

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,359
Sui Zhi would never want
to see you grieve like this.

140
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Those darned rebels took Sui Zhi's life

141
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,240
and tarnished his reputation,
so how can I not hate them?

142
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Aunt, I have a request.

143
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,120
Mu Dan, rise and speak.

144
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,240
I didn't come here seeking refuge.

145
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,279
I came to ask your help
in avenging Jiang Chang Yang.

146
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,960
I want to expose Prince Ning's faction's crimes.

147
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,800
Let all the wrongfully slain heroes
from the Promotion Feast find justice.

148
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,799
Even loyal ministers and generals struggle
with such dangerous undertakings.

149
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,200
How can mere women like us accomplish this?

150
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,799
Before coming to Jizhou,

151
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,240
I sent Chuan Yu to meet
General Yu Zheng in Hedong.

152
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,320
His father was ambushed and killed
by Prince Ning in Chang'an.

153
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,200
He's determined to avenge his father
and uphold imperial authority

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,879
to complete the unfinished great cause
of General Yu Chang.

155
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,799
Moreover, the Hedong Army
has always been brave and skilled in battle.

156
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,320
Therefore, I want to use my business earnings
to help them strengthen their troops,

157
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,879
stockpile provisions,
and procure stronger military weapons.

158
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,480
When the time is ripe, we'll attack Chang'an,

159
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,400
eliminate treacherous officials,
and purge evil around the emperor.

160
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,759
Assisting the imperial army
is a life-risking endeavor.

161
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,120
Mu Dan, Sui Zhi would never want you to risk
your life for him on such a dangerous path.

162
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,159
I'm not doing all this solely
for Jiang Chang Yang.

163
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:43,360
When I decided to establish Wuyong Hall,
I realized one truth.

164
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,039
Only under wise governance can

165
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,720
merchants thrive independently
and people live peacefully.

166
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,639
Jiang Chang Yang died building a peaceful world.
I'll walk the path he left unfinished.

167
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,400
Even if I die on this path, I'll have no regrets.

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Okay, I'll join you.

169
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,559
Request whatever you need.

170
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,319
Thank you, Aunt.

171
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Sui Zhi and I previously hid some gold ingots,
but these are far from sufficient.

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,319
Aunt, I recall you sailing widely
to foreign lands.

173
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,559
May I borrow your ships?

174
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:54,057
 ♫ Youth itself determines the path of wandering ♫

00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:27,840
Before boarding, Fu kept insisting
she'd get seasick.

183
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,279
Never imagined I'd be the one getting seasick.

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,839
though the taste may be rather bitter.

How is it going?

197
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,200
Our eldest son's eaten wheat bran for five days.
Has your monthly payment not arrived?

198
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,839
Go urge the Master again.

199
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,839
The county's taxes grow heavier daily.

200
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,440
Even the Master's accounts hold few coins.

201
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,960
A few days ago, I visited their family.

202
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,079
Their daughter also eats wheat bran.

203
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,079
Salvation! See the millet I've bartered.

204
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,559
- Really.
- Look. Millet.

205
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,559
Where is it?

206
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,319
It's at the dock. Go quickly!

207
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,400
- I'll go check.
- Go! Hurry!

208
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,919
- Where?
- From the dock trades.

209
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,160
What's wrong with my son?

210
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,319
It's just abdominal distension.

211
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,359
- Nothing serious.
- Fellow villagers!

212
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,480
Millet and wheat flour, fifty wen per bag!

213
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,720
We have no money.

214
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Exactly.

215
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
Exchange local products or work for goods
if you lack money.

216
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,039
We can't even find proper wheat here.
What local products?

217
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,599
True!

218
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,160
Madam, look.

219
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,200
This Dragon Whisker Grass you wear
isn't just decoration.

220
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Its roots make mats or paper.
Leaves treat illnesses.

221
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
Keep this. Everyone, look here!

222
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,599
Yu County has abundant mountain resources.

223
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,000
Dragon Whisker Grass, black wolfberry,
many unrecognized treasures.

224
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,759
We've documented numerous rare local products.

225
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,319
Come claim these guides if needed.

226
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,880
Find what's drawn to exchange for food.

227
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,759
Does everyone understand?

228
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,839
Alright!

229
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,839
Here's everything.

230
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,519
No rush. There's enough for all.

231
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,240
- Next!
- Okay.

232
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,559
One millet bag, please.

233
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,359
Here.

234
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,400
Yu County is poorer than our previous stops.

235
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,519
Thankfully these local goods help.

236
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,160
We gave discounts but still broke even.

237
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,240
Now we need supplies for Hedong Army.

238
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,599
We can't solve all problems, but every bit helps.

239
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,160
Put it here. I'll handle it.

240
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,960
Settle this now.

241
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,759
Young man, what do you want?

242
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,480
My mother asked me to buy lamp oil
for studying at night.

243
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
But I...

244
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
You want hand cream for your mother?

245
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,960
She wants me to earn honors for better life.

246
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,039
But I want her comfort now.

247
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,359
This cream would protect
her laundry-worn hands, right?

248
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
Take it.

249
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,440
I can't accept something for nothing.

250
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,880
I only have five wen, enough for one item.

251
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,279
Who said it's free?

252
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,960
You're buying this hand cream.

253
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,920
I'll front the lamp oil. Repay me later.

254
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,559
We're not related.
Why would you credit me this item?

255
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,640
Because I'm like your mother.

256
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,519
I hope you'll excel in the imperial exams
and become a good official when you grow up

257
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,640
so that you can help everyone live better lives.

258
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,400
Come repay these five wen when that time comes.

259
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
Take it.

260
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,880
Thank you, Madam.

261
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
Please tell me your name.

262
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll study diligently

263
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,919
and repay you for this lamp oil someday.

264
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:51,720
Ms. Feng from Jizhou wishes you great success.
I hope you'll become a talent.

265
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,119
I'll remember this. Thank you, Ms. Feng.

266
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,319
Don't be afraid. We mean no harm.

267
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,832

268
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:26,799

269
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,559
The Juebei barbarians are looting.
No one dares open shops anymore.

270
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,039
I have no other choice.

271
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:40,039
My wife has nasal congestion.
I came to beg your help while no one's around.

272
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,079
The autumn chill brings vulnerability
to wind-cold ailments.

273
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,519
Many townsfolk aren't getting timely treatment.

274
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,520
Thankfully they didn't raid my place.

275
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,119

276
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:03,599
Take it home quickly. Brew it on schedule. Here.

277
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,399
Thank you, Sir.

278
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,279
Mr. Yang.

279
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,079
Ms. Feng.

280
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,079
I truly can't afford your goods anymore.
This trip was wasted for you.

281
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,119
I'm truly sorry.

282
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,000
Mr. Yang, what's happening here?

283
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,920
The Juebei barbarians just came looting.
They warned the whole city.

284
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,200
They said they'll return tomorrow.

285
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,359
Told us to leave our grain and money at the doors.

286
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,880
Doesn't the Hedong Army garrison here?
Juebei should fear them.

287
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,119
Didn't you report it to the authorities?

288
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,279
We did.

289
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,480
But we border Juebei territory.

290
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,680
Those barbarians ride fast horses
in and out like wind.

291
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,880
By the time Hedong Army arrives,
they've already fled with loot.

292
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,720
The Hedong Army did try ambushing them.

293
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,079
But after wiping out one group,
new ones come within months.

294
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,119
Now we've resigned to fate.

295
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,400
As long as they don't kill or burn, let them loot.

296
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,559
Ms. Feng, you should leave quickly too.

297
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,399
If they target you, they'll take your goods.

298
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,519
Mr. Yang, can these Juebei people understand us?

299
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,319
Their two leaders understand and speak our tongue.

300
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,119
Are you thinking of...?

301
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,680
I have an idea that might solve this crisis.

302
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,000
Who are you?

303
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm a merchant wanting
to discuss big business with you.

304
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,919
Your attire shows you're not Juebei cavalry,
but hunters and herdsmen.

305
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,519
What's the meaning? Are you looking down on us?

306
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,279
I didn't mean that.

307
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,640
The Tang Dynasty is a land of propriety
and embraces diversity towards other nations.

308
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,599
You only steal goods without harming people.
It shows you're not murderous types.

309
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,079
I suppose you're forced to do this
due to food shortages at home.

310
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,879
What kind of trade exactly do you want with us?

311
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,440
I know a woman from Juebei.

312
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,240
She told me your lands
aren't suitable for farming.

313
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,839
But you raise excellent livestock
and have swift warhorses.

314
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,160
Here, cattle plow fields and transport goods.

315
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,519
We eat lamb and make woolen fabrics.

316
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,480
Your common goods could fetch high profits
when sold in the Central Plains.

317
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:21,240
Why not trade with me?
With money, won't you afford grains?

318
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,599
We get grains through raiding. Why spend money?

319
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,599
How often dare you raid
with General Yu Zheng guarding Hedong?

320
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,920
How many people have you lost
during these days of plundering for grains?

321
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,519
These cities will only grow poorer.

322
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,400
Your stolen grains will keep diminishing.

323
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,160
This isn't sustainable long-term.

324
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,519
If we trade, besides grains,

325
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,440
you can bring your families more provisions.

326
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,079
We have medicinal treatments if illness strikes.

327
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:02,040
Mutual benefit would make everyone happy.

328
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,159
We'll discuss with our tribe
and answer in three days.

329
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,720
Looking forward to your good news.

330
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,759
They've left. Come out, everyone. It's safe.

331
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,480
You can come out now.

332
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Wonderful!

333
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,039
Ms. Feng, your nobility deserves our bow.

334
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,079
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

335
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,079
No. Get up quickly, please rise.

336
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,559
- Get up, please.
- Thank you. Our gratitude.

337
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,759
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

338
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,160
Rise quickly, please.

339
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,359
Many thanks.

340
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,920
This would be profitable for me if successful.

341
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,520
But I wonder if they'll agree.

342
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,960
Still, everyone needn't worry excessively.

343
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,039
Yesterday, I sent word to the Hedong Army.

344
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,359
If Juebei remain stubborn,

345
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,079
General Yu Zheng will
personally negotiate a resolution.

346
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,200
Rest assured, everyone.

347
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,559
Our gratitude, Ms. Feng.

348
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:20,002
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

349
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,639
Miss.

350
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,759
No need. Thank you.

351
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,279
- No need for courtesy.
- Take this, Ms. Feng.

352
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,599
I appreciate your kindness,
but I'll decline the gift.

353
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,839
- Accept it.
- No more.

354
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,880
Truly unnecessary. Thank you.

355
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,079
Please accept it.

356
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,440
No need to be polite.
Please, I really can't accept any more.

357
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,240
Thank you.

358
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,119
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

359
00:29:53,157 --> 00:30:01,344
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

360
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:09,760
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

361
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:17,760

362
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Hurry up. Follow from behind.

363
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,280
Got it!

364
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,280
Quickly! Keep up closely.

365
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,359
Mu Dan is delivering goods to Hedong this time.

366
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,279
Which of you will accompany her?

367
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,880
Chuan Yu will escort her there.

368
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,480
There's crucial medicine in the south.
Mu Dan asked Fu and me to retrieve it personally.

369
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,559
Haven't seen Chuan Yu for days. Where is he?

370
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,760
Mu Dan assigned him a task.
He should return tomorrow.

371
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,680

372
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,839
The Medical Guild head noticed
our thriving business.

373
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,440
He heard I have a capable niece assisting me.

374
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,839
Now he wants me to match Mu Dan
with his eldest son.

375
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,599
Aunt, didn't you tell them
Mu Dan lost her husband?

376
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,680
I did. They don't mind.

377
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,280
They praised Mu Dan's virtues
and promised fair treatment if married.

378
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,759
But I notice Mu Dan's been radiant lately.

379
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:58,559
Perhaps she's moved on. A fresh start isn't bad.

380
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,520
If she truly moved on, would she avoid us
to mourn alone during Cold Clothes Festival?

381
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:40,960

382
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,680
Fu and Chuan Yu vowed
to share life's quilt and death's grave.

383
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,720
Chuan Yu finally gets it. Another worry settled.

384
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,160
Wait, who's Jiang Da Shan?

385
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,799
I don't have such an ugly name.

386
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,519
Then why did you name me Jiang Xiao Hua?

387
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
You're a rebel now. Can't use real names.

388
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Just make do with it.

389
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,429
If you write this name,
when clothes and food arrive in the netherworld,

390
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:26,400
King Yama couldn't find this person
and would carelessly distribute them.

391
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,359
I was stingy in life.
Never suffered such humiliation.

392
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,520
You're best at acting. Fool King Yama like before.

393
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,879
I can deceive spirits,
but you should stop deluding yourself.

394
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm gone now. Let go and start anew.

395
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,720
As for me,

396
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,040
I changed my name and traveled as a merchant.

397
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:14,839
I visited Juebei and sailed to Xinluo.

398
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:18,559
I saw vast lands even you've never witnessed.

399
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,159
Doesn't that count as new beginnings?

400
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,960
I'm here tonight because you cling to attachments.

401
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,079
On the flower boat, you said

402
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,919
even without me, you'd live well.

403
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,239
I've been happy lately.

404
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:58,320
Earnings help people or arm Hedong Army.

405
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,600
I've never betrayed my life's ambition.

406
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,760
But the you before me now is not well.

407
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,999
It's just that the deep night
brings some melancholy.

408
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,680
I just feel unwilling, regretting your absence.

409
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,120
You couldn't witness what I've accomplished.

410
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,039
Mu Dan...

411
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,959
Stop talking.

412
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:50,879
You've grown into my heart
and I can't split it in two.

413
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,319
We agreed before to stay together forever.

414
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,120
Don't go.

415
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:45,436
 ♫ Rainbow light dyes the delicate clothes ♫

416
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,596
 ♫ The clouds are deep with no end in sight ♫

417
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:53,564

420
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:07,880
 ♫ Why fear the separations of life ♫

421
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,760
Why can I touch you?

422
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,260
 ♫ No regrets and never a doubt ♫

423
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,400
Is it because of the paper boat?

424
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,119
 ♫ The spirit of blossom is not exhausted ♫

425
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,439

 ♫ The heart is boundless ♫

427
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,840
Mu Dan, this is a dream.

 ♫ Only wish to cherish day and night ♫

429

430
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Slow down.

431
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,120
Got it.

432
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,159
Sir, the goods have arrived.

433
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,959
Coming.

434
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,000
Mr. Du, this is Ms. Feng.
She's delivering goods to our store.

435
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,680
The transit pass and contracts are all complete.

436
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,039
I know who she is, the renowned Ms. Feng.

437
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,839
I don't deserve such praise.

438
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,119
Mr. Du, see how busy it is outside?

439
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,039
If you have instructions, let's discuss inside.

440
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,840
You're straightforward. Let's go.

441
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,640
After you, Mr. Du.

442
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:10,000
Sir, please have my workers unload the goods.

443
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,360
Okay.

444
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,160
Chuan Yu.

445
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Unload the goods.

446
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,159
Ms. Feng, being well-informed, you must know

447
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:30,159
all merchants passing through Zhang County
must leave tribute.

448
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,760
I've heard rumors. But today I only brought
two carts of leather goods.

449
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,920
This sum couldn't even buy your cloak.

450
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,039
After this delivery, you will head north.

451
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:49,119
The rest of your goods await at Zhang River docks.

452
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,079
You came prepared indeed.

453
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,208
Send your workers.
Either fetch cash or use goods as collateral.

454
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:04,319
You won't leave Zhang County
without leaving 500 strings of coins.

455
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,039
No need to trouble you.
I've prepared your gift in advance.

456
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,839
Chuan Yu.

457
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,400
You actually possess Xinluo's fish-scale silk.

458
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,559
My trade with Xinluo has always been legitimate.
I've never dared to handle tribute goods.

459
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,559
Sir, doesn't this fish-scale silk
look familiar to you?

460
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,200
This was cut from your own mansion.
How could you fail to recognize it?

461
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,119
You dare burglarize an official's mansion?
Should I have you arrested right now?

462
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,199
A County Magistrate exploiting
the common people and oppressing merchants.

463
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,559
Not just this fish-scale silk, but the seal fur
you're wearing is also royal tribute.

464
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:57,159
I have plenty more evidence against you.

465
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:04,119
If I don't leave the city today, my associates
will hand over all evidence to the authorities.

466
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:11,800
You should know I have connections in the capital.
Watch you don't "get burned."

467
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,400
I've discovered your distant relatives
in the capital serve Prince Ning.

468
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,519
But everyone knows our Provincial Governor
is an impartial and upright official.

469
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,600
I fear your capital allies won't act fast enough
before you're stripped of position and exiled.

470
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,119
Have you submitted the evidence to the Governor?

471
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,760
I personally witnessed the Governor reviewing it.

472
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,919
Mr. Du's comfortable days are over.

473
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,200
From now on, Zhang County's people and merchants
won't suffer under tyranny anymore.

474
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:13,026
 ♫ In endless Chang'an,
the zither's melody distant ♫

475
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,440
 ♫ Plum and willow trees bask in the sunshine,
as splendor returns with the year ♫

476
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:29,632
 ♫ Copper palace battlements,
songs and dances, glass goblets ♫

477
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:37,984
 ♫ Idle clouds and duckweed,
a thousand flowers burst forth ♫

478
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:46,181
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

479
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:54,368
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

480
00:42:54,368 --> 00:43:02,784
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

481
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:10,784
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫

482
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:38,936
 ♫ The distant night sky strewn with stars,
reflecting the lovely moon ♫

483
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:46,387
 ♫ The peony's magnificent beauty
fills the Fragrance Garden ♫

484
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:54,373
 ♫ With a heart as my lantern,
I don't mind the distant mountain paths ♫

485
00:43:54,373 --> 00:44:02,682
 ♫ The flute's sound,
a fleeting life's wishes fulfilled ♫

486
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:10,944
 ♫ Time passes gracefully,
affairs settle like fading smoke ♫

487
00:44:10,944 --> 00:44:19,200
 ♫ Let the years go by,
carried by the wind to early desires ♫

488
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:27,628
 ♫ If the heart is like water,
the bloom is ever-present ♫

489
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:35,628
 ♫ Still cherish the moon of my hometown,
to meet for long ♫
