1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,720
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,520
It's so mysterious.

3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,280
What surprise are you going to give me?

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,920
Take a guess. It's what you want the most in your heart.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,959
Be careful.

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Is it

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
the house, car, money,

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,039
I have all my wives and children.

9
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,640
Then I'll be a salted fish.

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,039
What are you daydreaming about?

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,080
Let's try something practical.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,200
Staying up late without losing hair

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
is my lowest wish.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,880
Isn't this my three axes?

15
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,600
Yes.

16
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,200
It was redeemed by your husband.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
He even rebuilt the golden body for it.

18
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,280
Oh my god.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,479
Mr. Gu, you are so nice to me.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640
Don't say anything cheesy.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,800
As long as you like it.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,840
Now the flower cake business is on track.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
All your wishes

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,800
will come true one by one.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Dear.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,200
I have something to do.

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,880
I won't go to the market.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
It's already copied?

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,760
I don't believe it.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
It's definitely not as delicious as ours.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
That's right. It's definitely not as delicious as ours.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
Sister.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,160
Our Fantasy Flower Cakes are the best.

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
This is the best flavor.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Our skin is crispy.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,920
The filling will definitely suit you.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
Our color is beautiful, sweet but not greasy.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,480
Come on, sister.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
Our family uses

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,440
pure natural and polluted roses as ingredients.

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
Yes.

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,600
Look at ours

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
We have lilies.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
We have jasmine and silver.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Both.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
Let me see yours.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Development a new product overnight.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,640
Do we have to work so hard?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
Once something becomes popular,

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,400
follow the trend.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,079
But I didn't expect it to be so fast.

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
It seems

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,440
it's time to plan a new way out.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,520
No, we're all waiting.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,920
If you can't find a way out,

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
we'll go back to our old business

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,200
and continue the robbery with me.

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
Yes.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
Gu, have you figured it out?

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Not so fast.

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
Mr. Gu sacrificed his life

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
for Black Tiger Fortress.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,320
Don't force him.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,040
We are really afraid

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
to live a poor life.

66
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,240
That's right.

67
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,920
Honey.

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,480
What's wrong?

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm fine.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Stop talking. There's always a way before the mountain.

71
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
Take a good rest.

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,600
No one can disturb him.

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Be careful.

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
Mr. Gu is such a handsome boy.

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,160
has been tortured.

76
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,200
Brother Hu.

77
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,160
The merchant ship is on the shore.

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
It's time for me

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,880
to save Black Tiger Hideout.

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,000
Guys, come with me to do something big.

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Come on, let's do something big.

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
You're back.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm in a rush. I'm definitely not.

84
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,400
when you were sleeping.

85
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
I see.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,280
Don’t worry. I trust you.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,400
So what did you do?

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
We’re still investigating.

89
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,240
Investigate what?

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
Why did you get him out?

91
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm not trying to trick you.

92
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
You said it yourself.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
How do you know what I'm thinking?

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
Why do you look so pale?

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
Where did you go?

96
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
Sister, Brother Gu.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,240
Come out and have a look.

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
I finally made it.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
You... You went to rob?

100
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Unfortunately, Gu was not there.

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,320
I was so brave.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
You are bandits.

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,040
You can't do pirates' business.

104
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,920
You're all wet.

105
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,000
you must be fishing for goods in the sea.

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
Did a merchant ship sink?

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Stop it.

108
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,440
Besides, you're going to wear my underpants.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Then tell me.

110
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,040
With so many treasures,

111
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,040
we will make a fortune.

112
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
Open the box, guys.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
What is this?

114
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,520
I risked my life to get these.

115
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,440
Wait.

116
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,800
Since these merchant ships are sinking,

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
these rouge and powder

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,720
can't be delivered in a short time.

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,159
It will soon become a delicate object.

120
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,560
I'll go down the mountain to investigate.

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,760
You mean this rouge is out of stock?

122
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,760
This rouge is the most sold here.

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
How long will it take

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,400
how long will it take?

125
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,920
I need more than a month.

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
White clouds. Why is she here?

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,440
Make a reservation.

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,160
Are you okay?

129
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm fine.

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,120
Go.

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,400
Rouge, top-quality rouge.

132
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Miss, come and take a look at the rouge.

133
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,360
What is Baiyun doing recently?

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,280
Gu Jinyu.

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,040
How long are you going to hide it from us?

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
We treat you

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,159
as sworn brothers.

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
How can you do this to us?

139
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,320
Is your identity exposed?

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,360
I don’t know what you are talking about.

141
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,800
Stop acting. Please.

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,760
Guys, set up the formation.

143
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,120
What's wrong with this?

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,800
You're sick, honey.

145
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,840
You don't want the antidote?

146
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,040
You've gone too far.

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,320
She didn't even tell us about the poisoning.

148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
She searched all medical books for you these days.

149
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,720
She begged all the witch doctors and used blood as the guide

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,920
to create this magical medicine.

151
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,960
Compared to what my husband did for us,

152
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
what I did for us is nothing.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,680
Take the antidote.

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,440
We've prepared a welcoming ceremony for you.

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,280
and officially accept you as our brother.

156
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
The poison has been detoxified.

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,960
But if one day my identity is exposed,

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
what should I do?

159
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,280
Dear.

160
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
What is this?

161
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
It's such a pity to lose it

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,040
It's not a pity.

163
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,120
In other people's eyes, it's just rubbish.

164
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,920
Do you know

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,280
how to become a qualified Young Master?

166
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,080
to deal with internal affairs and save money.

167
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,880
To protect the city,

168
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,000
You need to be emotionally emotionless and heartless.

169
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't let anyone know your weakness.

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
If you can't bear the mission of Young Master Rong,

171
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,920
don't blame me for taking back all your rights.

172
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,280
Yes, Father.

173
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,800
I won't let you down.

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Life would be so boring if there were only missions.

175
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,440
It's because good things are fading away,

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
That's why I have to save it and take it slow.

177
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,600
If someone sees it as waste paper,

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,160
he's blind.

179
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,040
He doesn't know the treasure.
