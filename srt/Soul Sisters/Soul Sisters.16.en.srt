1
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,880
Come on.

2
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,640
Come on.

3
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,080
If we get this deal,

4
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,200
we can make a lot of money.

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,680
and have a happy new year.

6
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,440
So you're celebrating again.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,320
We haven't earned much money yet.

8
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,400
It's just a small celebration every three days.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,600
One big drink every five days.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
Life is short.

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,800
Enjoy yourself.

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,880
OK.

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,200
One, please.

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,320
Come on.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
Come on.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,320
If you are willing to end up like this,

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,200
I’ll risk my life to accompany you.

18
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,479
Thank you for your kindness.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,600
I won’t come.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,320
Why are you dilly-dallying like a woman?

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,880
Exactly.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,080
You’ve seen the second head in women’s clothes.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,320
It’s so beautiful.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,920
Exactly.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,840
People would believe him in disguise.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,080
Is it true?

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,160
Come on.

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,920
Since everyone says so,

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
I'll do as you say.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,640
Okay.

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Brother Gu.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
Sorry.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Ouch!

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,280
Second Master.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,480
We must get the map as soon as possible.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Otherwise, your identity will be exposed.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Brother Gu.

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Brother Gu.

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Brother Gu, don't be afraid.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
No one knows your identity better than me.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,160
You know? How do you know?

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,520
No one in the village

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
who cares about you more than me?

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,320
According to the city rules, those who know my real identity will die.

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,560
But how can I do that?

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,600
Why don't we knock him out and let the guards watch him?

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,600
or send him to the Western Region.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,520
If only you were a woman.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
Unfortunately, you're a man.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,520
What?

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Rub

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,800
You help me. I'll help you.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,040
Let's deepen our relationship.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,040
Gu.

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
Brother Gu! Brother Gu!

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
Brother Gu.

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,519
Dear.

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
I made you a new dress.

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
Try it on.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,720
You must be good at sewing.

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,760
But it's getting late.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Why don't we...

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Try it.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
No need.

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Tomorrow.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
I'll try it tomorrow.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
Okay.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,200
Isn't this a bra for disguising as a man?

69
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,760
Why do you have this?

70
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
Are you...

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Let me explain.

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,920
Actually, I...

73
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
Say no more.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,240
I see.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
If my identity is exposed,

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
she will never forgive me.

77
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,000
When I was young, my father took me to rob.

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,040
I used it once to cover my identity.

79
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,480
I didn't expect

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,800
you took out my old item.

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,960
Honey.

82
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,080
You love me so much.

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,320
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
Every day

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
nothing.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Bad news!

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Bad news!

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,760
What's wrong?

89
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Didn't Wang Hu get kicked out?

90
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,000
What else can he do?

91
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
Not Wang Hu.

92
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,680
It's a necessity for our new year's goods.

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
It was wiped out overnight.

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
We can't buy it from all the stores.

95
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
What?

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
That's bad.

97
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
The goods will be delivered in three days.

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
If we go down the mountain now,

99
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't buy so much sugar

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
Is it over

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,080
What should I do?

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,760
Wait.

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,920
You have an idea?

104
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,880
It occurred to me that

105
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
this order and the penalty

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
is three times the payment.

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
How about

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,880
How about

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,880
disband Black Tiger Stronghold?

110
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,480
Yes, while we still have some money,

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Let's split up and run away.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
We can't afford it anyway.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,320
Why don't we share it?

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
Let's break up.

115
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
Let's break up.

116
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,160
Break it up.

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,760
If you can't deliver the goods on time,

118
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,240
you have to pay three times the payment.

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
Heihu Stronghold is completely ruined.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,320
Mr. Zhao,

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,680
You're really good at seducing a fish.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You did a good job.

123
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Those idiots from Black Tiger Hideout

124
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
thought they got a big deal.

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
But that Gu

126
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
is not that easy to deal with.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,159
I've bought all the sugar in the city.

128
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,200
Even if Gu has three heads and six arms,

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
he can’t buy sugar within three days.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,440
let alone delivery on time.

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you here?

132
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Someone wants to make a fool of himself.

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
I was just passing by.

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,360
Xiao Tian Hu.

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
Cut the crap.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,920
Let's get down to business.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,920
We agreed to deliver at 3 p.m.

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,880
It's not even midnight now.

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,040
We won't break the contract.

140
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Let's check the goods first.

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,280
Wait.

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,960
I want to open this box.

143
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,480
Open another box.

144
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Have you had enough?

145
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,680
Take it home if it's not enough.

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,000
It's okay.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
It's all here. Try it.

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
What's going on?

149
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,280
Why is there sugar?

150
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,960
Why don't we disband Heihu Stronghold?

151
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,320
There's sugar.

152
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,000
Where is the sugar?

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,560
In the mountains.

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,280
as long as there are wild bees,

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
there must be honey.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,800
That's right.

157
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Black Tiger Stronghold has nothing.

158
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,680
But there are many woods.

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,240
There are as many wild honey as you want.

160
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,440
Check the goods and bring the money.

161
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,680
Everyone.

162
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,960
I didn't do it.

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,440
Zhao Mu asked me to do it.

164
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,160
He also did the sugar thing.

165
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,840
Traitor!

166
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,040
Zhao Mu.

167
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,120
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's get even with each other today.

169
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
Which one is yours first?

170
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,440
I have money.

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,720
I have money.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,480
We can talk.

173
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
Guys, go!

174
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,720
Bad guy!
