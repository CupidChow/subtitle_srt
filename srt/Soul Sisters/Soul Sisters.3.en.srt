1
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,000
My father prepared

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,480
for me.

3
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,520
Black Tiger Hideout can be saved.

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,000
We've saved a lot.

5
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,400
external debts.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,080
Not only Black Tiger Stronghold has no extra money,

7
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,880
but we owe them a lot.

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,880
We have no other choice.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,039
Brothers, go down the mountain to rob!

10
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Robbery!

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
Madam, the road ahead is steep.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,759
You can't push it up by yourself.

13
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,120
Guys.

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
Keep your feet steady.

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
Okay.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
You are good people. Thank you.

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,840
Robbery!

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,640
Take it for treatment.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,759
Thank you. Thank you.

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,600
With her alone,

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,440
we'll have to pay for it.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,920
We have to find another way.

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,320
Guys.

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,560
Black Tiger Village needs you.

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,400
Anyone with special skills

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
who can help my husband make money

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,079
who can help my husband make money.

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,800
Really?

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
See?

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,920
I told you Black Tiger Hideout has many talents.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,000
There are many talents.

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Let me do it.

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
You go first.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
Okay.

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
My tongue, a bow knot.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,680
is a piece of cake.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay.

38
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,880
That's it.

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,520
Next.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,160
I'll show you how to fall asleep in a second.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,600
Wake up.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll show you

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
Eat a nest in one bite.

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Okay.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,280
Dog Remie provokes La Se.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
Okay.

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
Make way.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Let me do it.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,720
Chicken fight.

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,120
It's true. It's true.

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,160
Yes.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,040
I didn't expect this mountain to be so strange.

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,560
It blooms in winter.

54
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
I told you

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,160
Black Tiger Stronghold is a good place.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
But we can do nothing.

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,440
If I can't find a way to make money,

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
I won't be far away from our partnership.

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,440
Is there any way

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,720
To achieve the source of no origin

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,000
I know thousands of flowers are not as good as my smile.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,520
But you don't have to

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,640
to be obsessed with my beauty.

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,640
I have a way.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
When I was helping with business at home,

66
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,600
I learned how to make various products.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,840
The flowers at the back mountain

68
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
If we use it,

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
we'll be able to open the source without any cost.

70
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,320
That's great.

71
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
Do you have any business

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,360
Saving money and saving trouble?

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,160
and make money.

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Let me think about it.

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
Okay, I'll go with you.

76
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,880
How can I help Black Tiger Hideout?

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,760
You haven't finished these within a day.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
How can you become a qualified Young Master?

79
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Father, give me more time.

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Tell them, when will Young Master Rong finish?

81
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,360
When can he eat and sleep?

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,080
Why are you still up?

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
I can't think of a good way.

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Do I deserve to sleep?

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,560
Your love for Black Tiger Hideout

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
to the Dark Tiger Hideout.

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,120
It doesn't matter if you can't think of it.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
Nothing is hard in the world. As long as you give up,

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,920
Anyone is fine, but not me.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
Why can't you?

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
If you can't figure it out today,

92
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
Black Tiger Hideout will be disbanded tomorrow.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,880
The sun will rise west and set east.

94
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
or the world will be destroyed.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
See? It doesn’t matter to take it slow.

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
I’m not worried.

97
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,040
What’s the hurry?

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,800
It's okay to think about everything.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,640
There's no need.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,880
Smile and your life will be much easier.

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
Honey, what's the matter?

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,760
Let's sleep first.

103
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,960
No, I understand.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
But I can't sleep until I finish it.

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
Go to sleep first.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
What stubborn donkey?

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,040
We don't allow

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,800
to die from exhaustion.

109
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,240
The sun hasn't come out yet.

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
Why are you up so early today?

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,280
Because I have a diligent husband.

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,400
He didn't sleep after the chicken barked.

113
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,680
With him, we don't need to raise chicken.

114
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,520
What are you doing?

115
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,640
No chicken?

116
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,040
I'll kill it to replenish your health.

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,000
Stay where it's cool.

118
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,280
I have to wait for it to lay eggs.

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,200
to cook fried eggs for my husband.

120
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,400
Why are you so nice to him?

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
You don't understand love.

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,720
He stayed up late to make money for the knock-off.

123
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,960
I have to do something for him.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Right?

125
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Honey.

126
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,840
You must be hungry.

127
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,400
You need to eat to think.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
There's a way out.

129
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,080
Look.

130
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,640
Flower sauce is the easiest but the profit is low.

131
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Flower tea with high profit but low demand.

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
And this.

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Fresh pancakes cost the most, but they taste good.

134
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
How should I put it? Choose one.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,080
But no matter which one you choose,

136
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,679
we need money to start our business.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,679
But we don't have a penny

138
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,280
without a coin.

139
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,600
Sister, I'm here.

140
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Do whatever you want.

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,920
Fine. Who told you to rob?

142
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,480
I...

143
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
He didn't rob.

144
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
He did.

145
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,160
You sold yourself?

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Three Axes.

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,240
You can question my IQ,

148
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
but you can't insult my character.

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,960
It's a misunderstanding.

150
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
To make up for your young heart,

151
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,960
Choose one.

152
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,720
Choose one.

153
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,320
It's so delicious.

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
Let me try

155
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Come and have a look. Delicious flower cakes.

156
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,400
Hot flower cakes

157
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,840
Three cents per five cents

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,480
Try it.

159
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,120
Flower cake.

160
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,240
Miss, try it.

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,920
Five cents.

162
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
We're not passionate enough.

163
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,240
Guys,

164
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
Let them see the warmest fire in winter.

165
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,960
The flower cake in our village is so delicious.

166
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
Why don't you try it?

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,400
What are you doing?

168
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,760
Don't go.

170
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
Flower cakes are so delicious. Why don't you buy them?

171
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,280
This is for you.

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
You have no taste.

174
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,280
Three cents for one. Pay up.

175
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
Are you buying or not?

176
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll chop your head off if you don't buy it.

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,400
I'm tired. Destroy it.

178
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
I can’t make money.

179
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I’ll be the leader sooner or later.
