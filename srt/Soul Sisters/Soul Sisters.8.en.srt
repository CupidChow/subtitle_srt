1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,640
My husband is giving you a chance.

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,440
If you don’t tell me,

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,760
according to the rules.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Three cuts and six holes.

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,000
What went wrong?

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,680
Confess and be lenient.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,039
If I bring out the evidence,

8
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,760
this wouldn't have happened.

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,080
Xiao Tian Hu, prepare witness and evidence.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,280
Wait.

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,360
I was blinded by oil.

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,440
and did something ridiculous.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,880
I...

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,920
Master.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Brother Gu, forgive me.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
You admit it?

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,039
But how did you know

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
How did you know I left this?

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,440
I was just saying.

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,800
Plus you have a guilty conscience.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
That's a trick.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,520
You, I...

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,160
For his own benefit,

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,240
for his own interests.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,600
The other troublemakers

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,120
were deceived, but they also made mistakes.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,200
A monthly bonus as punishment.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:18,880
Brilliant!

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,640
Good.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
These are

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,000
the cost cost of pure dew and rouge.

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,320
This cost is too much.

34
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Why don't we return in time

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
and be a profiteer?

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
This is to reduce the negative impact

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,760
to reduce the negative impact.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,320
He just knows how to say and write.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,160
Can I force him to write with an ax?

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
As for the rest,

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll never give them to you.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,680
Please save some.

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
These are the only profits left.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,840
The rouge market is full now.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,200
We need to find a new way out as soon as possible.

46
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,680
My husband is so smart and resourceful.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
He should have some tricks.

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,160
Not this time.

49
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,720
The rouge and petals are useless.

50
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,520
What a pity.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,120
Who did this?

52
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,600
Who was in charge of laundry yesterday?

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,079
The second leader.

54
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
No, Wang.

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,680
Even if I'm not the Second Master,

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,640
you should at least call me Smiley Tiger.

57
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Wang, Wang, that's not cool.

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
Wang.

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
You've created so many demons.

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,000
It's good that you're not kicked out.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
You should turn over a new leaf.

62
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
I only have this white pants.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
You dyed me into this sissy color.

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,240
How can I wear it?

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,400
I wash all the clothes in the village by myself.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
from dawn to night.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
It's dark.

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
I dropped a bottle of rouge in the washbasin.

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
Can you blame me?

70
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
Let me see.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,280
Darling, I didn't know you have such a hobby.

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
Brother Gu, this is mine.

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,880
Got it. Transform into a baby.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Let's change to garment-making business.

75
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,440
The old rouge

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,720
can be used

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
to dye clothes.

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,320
Did I help you?

79
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Your painting is colorless.

80
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,240
The more you look at, the more brighter your heart.

81
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,240
Clothes should be colorful

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,840
Here you are.

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I hope your future life

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
in the future.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm busy and forgot the time

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,920
There's no rush.

87
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,000
We won't stay up late tonight.

88
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
That's right.

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
You'll be rich if you listen to me.

90
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,040
Stop!

91
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,480
Stop!

92
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,560
What is this?

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Tiger, be careful.

94
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't even deserve to call Wang.

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Looking at you embroidering...

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
Tiger, be careful.

97
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Xiaohu.

98
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Madam!

99
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Ma'am! Ma'am!

100
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm sure you haven't seen a new-style woman outfit.

101
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
Yes. Come and have a look.

102
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
Come and buy

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,640
Beautiful and affordable.

104
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Beauty look at the clothes

105
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,520
You can't wear it if it's new or new.

106
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,240
This is too bold.

107
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I can't handle it.

108
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Try it.

109
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,640
Let's go.

110
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,240
It's hard to start.

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
Everything has a process of accepting it.

112
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,680
Take your time.

113
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
It's okay, honey.

114
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
Let's try to attract customers over there.

115
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,600
Let's go.

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,600
Take a look. It's a new style dress.

117
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,760
It's okay.

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
Relax.

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
Just have fun and everything will be solved.

120
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
Rabbits for sale!

121
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,760
The rabbit is so cute.

122
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,160
Boss, one.

123
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,920
Okay.

124
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,480
Here's your rabbit.

125
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,040
Thank you.

126
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Thank you, honey.

127
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm glad you like it.

128
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,560
Do you think the rabbit will be cold?

129
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Be careful.

130
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,440
What's wrong?

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
Take it.

132
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,360
Let me put it on you.

133
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,840
This is...

134
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,880
This is a pendant from my childhood.

135
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,760
The other gave it to a lady.

136
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
They were supposed to be a couple.

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Let go of me!

138
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,400
Let me down!

139
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,520
Let go of her!

140
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
Put me down!

141
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,160
Little girl.

142
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,040
Run!

143
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,800
Sister, this is for you.

144
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
Come visit me next time.

145
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,000
I hope you can come out again.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,520
I'll come to you.

147
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,920
Let's make a pinky swear.

148
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Pinky swear, never change.

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,680
How dare you go out in women's clothes?

150
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,960
Father told me to pretend to be a man every day.

151
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
But I was originally a lady.

152
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,360
Shut up!

153
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Once others know your identity,

154
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,840
it will be a disaster to destroy the city.

155
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,560
When you reflect on yourself, get up.

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm a man, not a girl.

157
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm a man, not a girl.

158
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm a man, not a girl.

159
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,600
It's you.

160
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,880
I think I have an idea.
