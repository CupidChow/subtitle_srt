1
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,240
My savings for so many years

2
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,000
It's empty now.

3
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. It's empty. Let's go.

4
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
Here you go. Here you go.

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,480
And these IOU.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,280
I wanted to make sure Gu Jinyu can't turn over.

7
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
But he was too cunning

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,520
and fell into his trap.

9
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,240
I would have asked you to get rid of him.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,320
If I had killed him earlier,

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,360
There's no such thing.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
to prove yourself?

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,200
Now,

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
Not only does he know your name,

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,280
and the government.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
They are looking for you everywhere.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,840
So...

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm here to discuss solutions with you.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,200
In business,

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,400
in business.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
The most important thing now

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
is to make sure my nephew can take over the position of City Governor.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,880
We still have a chance.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
I've contacted some important spies in the City Governor's Residence.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,759
As long as we catch him,

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,440
we can attack him immediately.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,360
Wrong point?

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,400
I've seen Gu Jinyu in women's clothes.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,520
in women's clothes.

30
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,479
Did you find anything else?

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Recently,

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,480
a few maids who have served Gu Jinyu recently.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,039
It is said

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,720
when he wears clothes and baths,

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
he never let anyone serve him.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,640
Even when sleeping,

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
even when sleeping.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
If he is a woman,

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
everything makes sense.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,880
Yes.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,079
This woman can't

42
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,640
take over the position of City Governor.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
I can lose the money,

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
but Gu Jinyu

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,400
must die.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,200
We're rich!

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,720
I'm finally reborn.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
You money-grubber.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,840
You're daydreaming.

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,040
Everyone wants to get rich overnight.

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
Besides, the chance is right in front of us.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,320
There's something more exaggerated.

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm rich.

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,600
I can't spend all my money in my life.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,240
Where is my money?

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,640
I know all these patterns.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
But I don’t understand if they are put together.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Did the old chief draw it

59
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,400
to take over the fortress?

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,000
The treasure

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,760
should be somewhere in the back mountain.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,280
But we need to crack other information.

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,160
Then we need to develop the spirit of a fool moving the mountain.

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Ask our men to dig tonight.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
You're the midwife who delivered Gu Jinyu's baby, right?

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,680
Is he a man or a woman?

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,200
Please spare my life.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,200
I'm just an ordinary farmer.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,280
Then why do you have things from the City Governor's Residence?

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I can only say

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,399
Master Rong hid you well.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,880
If I hadn't played some cruel tricks

73
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
and met a few weak guys,

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,640
I couldn't find you.

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
Grandma.

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Grandma.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,240
Poppet.

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,159
Grandma.

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,120
Poppet.

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Grandma.

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,440
Poppet.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Poppet.

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,159
Grandma.

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
You look like a lucky boy.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
Unfortunately, I met a foolish grandmother.

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,240
My Lord.

87
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,800
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,760
I'll tell you.

89
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll tell you everything.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,000
Young Master is indeed

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
a real girl.

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Sure.

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,840
Take him away.

94
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,400
Poppet.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Grandma.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,680
Poppet.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,640
Gu Jinyu.

98
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's see how you can turn over this time.

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,080
Master Rong has worked so hard to succeed the throne for her.

100
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,360
The whole world is hiding it.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,440
By the way,

102
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
I heard that

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,640
the mission given by Master Rong

104
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,000
is to find the map in Black Tiger Hideout.

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,720
Our top priority

106
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,440
is to send an assassin to Black Tiger Hideout.

107
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
It's good to kill Gu Jinyu.

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,400
If not,

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,080
we'll try to expose her daughter and the treasure hunt map

110
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,040
and made her break up with Black Tiger Hideout.

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
and cut off her wings.

112
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,120
Didn't we agree to ask our brothers to come together?

113
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,600
I thought about it. There are too many people.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,480
It's not good to leak the news.

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,080
Your three-stroke axe dance is a demon.

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,160
Three shovels would be good.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,840
No.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,960
Do you really think I'm a fool?

119
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,320
What about you two?

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Where are you going?

121
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
We're definitely going to

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,640
to dig the treasure map.

123
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
Dear.

124
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
You and I are each other's backs.

125
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's go up together.

126
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,400
They're coming for me.

127
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
Protect Yun Xi.

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
For the treasure map,

129
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,760
for the treasure map.

130
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
You're a girl.

131
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,960
Cloud.

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,880
You lied to me so hard.

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,760
Clouds

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
The clouds.

135
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,760
I told her not to fall so deep.

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,480
The clouds

137
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,200
Clouds.

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Listen to me.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
I don't want to hear it. Leave.

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Cloud

141
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,760
I've wanted to tell you countless times

142
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
the truth.

143
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
But I'm afraid

144
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm afraid I'll lose you if I tell you.

145
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
So you watched me

146
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,680
give my heart to a woman.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
Gu Jinyu.

148
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,360
You lied to me so hard.

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,600
How can you be so cruel?

150
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
I admit

151
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,559
I approached you

152
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
for the treasure map.

153
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,600
But I didn't expect I would fall in love with this place.

154
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,880
Fall in love with the life here.

155
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,080
Our experience together is real.

156
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,320
Our feelings together are real.

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
If it's possible,

158
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,240
I want to dig out my heart for you.

159
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,400
whether your heart is real or not.

160
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,040
I don't know anymore.

161
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
I promised to protect you.

163
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
But I broke my promise.

164
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,480
I still hurt you in the end.

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,800
This is the first product you made for me.

168
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,160
It represents romantic and beautiful flower cakes.

169
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
But I didn't expect

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,360
it was a poison covered with honey.

171
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,000
We made Tanghulu together.

172
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,400
I thought

173
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
we would be together forever.

174
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
But I didn't expect

175
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,840
it would

176
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,120
lies and deception.

177
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
You made my world colorful.

178
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,360
So I want to draw this memory

179
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,280
this memory.

180
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,760
to make you a birthday gift.

181
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
Beautiful memories

182
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,200
are all your lies and lies.

183
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It keeps reminding me

184
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
how ridiculous I am.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
No clouds

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,000
Clouds

187
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,800
The clouds.

188
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,240
I know I have no right to ask for your forgiveness.

190
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,360
But can you give me a chance?

191
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,640
I want to make up for it.

192
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't touch me.

193
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
From now on,

194
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
we're done.

195
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,520
and never meet again.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,280
I've remembered

197
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,840
the content of this treasure map.

198
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
You will never know its secret.

199
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,840
Yunxi.

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
You saved me

202
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,600
warmed me

203
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,600
made my world colorful.

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,360
But I lied to you

205
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
and made you sad.

206
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,920
I lost you.

207
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,280
Young Master Rong.

208
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,520
Master Rong wants to see you.

209
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,680
Isn't the map

210
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
has been destroyed.

211
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
Take this to report.

212
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
Who can tell

213
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
who can tell the difference?

214
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
Yes.

215
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,000
You never let me down.

216
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,720
This time is no exception.

217
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,080
I will

218
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,160
I will hold the succession ceremony

219
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
and pass the position to you.

220
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
you can lead the army to take the treasure.

221
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,800
Please protect the peace of Black Tiger Stronghold.

222
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,440
Don't hurt the innocent.

223
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,200
Black Tiger Stronghold is just your stepping stone.

224
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,960
Stop your ridiculous sympathy and mercy.

225
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Zhao Mu.

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,760
What are you doing here?

227
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,720
If you kill me,

228
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm afraid Gu Jinyu will be my companion soon.

229
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
What do you mean?

230
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,280
If Gu Jinyu is a girl,

231
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,520
is a girl,

232
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,840
Not only will he not be able to take over the position of City Governor,

233
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,840
and no place to stay.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,480
or your life will be ruined.

235
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,120
or your life will be in danger.

236
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,440
So you sent the assassin?

237
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,920
to let me know about this.

238
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,760
and break up with her.

239
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,920
You should thank me.

240
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,880
I helped you recognize her.

241
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
Why don't you marry me?

242
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,160
Marry me.

243
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,720
Bah!

244
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,760
He's full of shit.

245
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,360
Stop talking to him.

246
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
If I die,

247
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
someone will spread the news to the world.

248
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,840
If you want to protect her,

249
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
marry me.

250
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
Gu Jinyu's life

251
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,880
is up to you.
