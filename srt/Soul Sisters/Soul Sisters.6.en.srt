1
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Flower pastries will lose their waist.

2
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,840
Tell me an experience.

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,120
No rules are allowed.

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,960
So, I decided to change everyone.

5
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,519
If we succeed,

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
everyone will get dividends at the end of the year.

7
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,680
How?

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,039
Roaring Tiger.

9
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
The first step is production.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,720
Start.

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
The first step is production.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,520
Pick flowers.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,640
Blow them.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,440
Kenma!

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,360
A finished product.

16
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,000
Each of them has their own duties. It's more efficient

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
and more efficient.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,080
The second step

19
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,680
sales.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,080
If you want to sell goods,

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,039
100 rouges and 100 people.

22
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,560
There are three women. There's no fight.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
One for three men.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
How many men and women each?

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,960
Start counting.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
I know.

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Women 25 men 75

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,000
Awesome.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
The third step is after-sales service.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,160
A good customer service

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,960
will trigger customers’ desire to buy

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,640
and the desire to buy back.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
New Year's Eve is coming.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,079
What should I give her?

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
She looks pale and pale.

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
What should I do?

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Present makeup boots, please identify the blush.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
Fortress brand rouge.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,520
to make you beautiful.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,680
It doesn't work at all.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
Call your boss out.

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,960
Hello.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
What can I do for you?

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,600
I don't know how to use it. Please call number one.

45
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,240
Call number two for allergy.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,320
The color is not right. Please call after-sales number three.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
We can't refund for seven days.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
Call after-sale number four.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,560
That's all.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,320
Calling after-sales number five.

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
Once everything is ready,

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
we can start the real battle.

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,760
Welcome.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
Welcome.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Sister, the blush is natural and harmless.

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Don't you want to try?

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
I have to take care of the baby. I don't have time.

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,440
That's easy. We'll provide free hugs service.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Good boy.

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,880
Welcome.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Miss, please try it.

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,760
Today is my birthday.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,440
on my birthday today.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
That's easy.

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Happy birthday.

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
This color of lotus is very suitable for you.

67
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Our product

68
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,520
is planted by our village.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,079
It was extracted naturally.

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
This one. How much? I'll buy it.

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,600
Your skin looks so nice, right?

72
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
Thank you.

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,320
My face.

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
Let me see what happened.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
I think he's allergic.

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,560
Allergic?

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,960
If my face is ruined,

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
I'll smash your stall tomorrow.

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Give me back my money!

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
I don't want it.

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
You're destined to be a workaholic.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
What about you? Why are you here so late?

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,760
I'm risking my life to accompany my husband.

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,400
Tell me, why are you still up so late?

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,560
What did you come up with?

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,000
Sit.

87
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
Look, according to the skin of customers,

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,400
we should sort them out in advance.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
For example, roses and Yoyo.

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
the rouge made from raw materials.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,520
can’t be used

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,840
can't be used.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
As for hawthorn and first-class red,

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,240
the rouge made from raw materials

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Pregnant women are not suitable to use.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Honey.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,520
Honey.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Marriage is like this. What else can a wife ask for?

99
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,480
Aren't you here to help?

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,640
Yes.

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
You use your brain and I do it.

102
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,600
Aren't you tired of working together?

103
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,159
Right?

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Come on, teach me how to do it.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,240
Open it and smell it.

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,280
Look, this is Yoyo, right?

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,880
It's just like the rose's.

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
Stronghold rouge.

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,720
to make you beautiful.

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,240
You can use it according to your skin.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
Come and have a look.

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Come and have a look

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
You can take a look.

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Control the knock-off cards.

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Copy the tag!

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
Copy the tag!

117
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,480
Copy the tag!

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
and the knock-off cards.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,000
They've gone too far.

120
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,280
They ruined my face during the day.

121
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,200
and threatened my family at night.

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Miss, you can't do business with benevolence.

123
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,120
You can't simply spread rumors.

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
Ask your men.

125
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,200
What did I say?

126
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,680
What happened?

127
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,160
I wanted you to meet Mr. Shen

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
and get married.

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,680
But now,

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,880
The marriage has been ruined.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,360
If you dare to make trouble,

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,240
I'll shave your face.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Do you hear me?

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,680
Not only did you force me, you also threatened me.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,960
When I see the knock-off shop,

136
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
I have to take a detour.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,240
Yes.

138
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,800
Are you a bandit or a bandit?

139
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,040
It's hard to change.

140
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,120
Who bought your stuff?

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
Aren't you in a hurry to get yourself killed?

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Yeah.

143
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,560
The training is so bad.

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Why are you still using bandits?

145
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,159
Apologize now.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
Miss, I'm sorry.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,920
It's too late to apologize.

149
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm going to pay you back.

150
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Smash it!

151
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
Wait.

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,280
Miss, it's our fault.

153
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,400
But the most important thing now

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
is to restore your face.

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,640
Do you think I'll trust you again?

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,600
If I can't restore your face,

157
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,080
let alone smashing this shop,

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,240
I swear

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,960
I will never appear on the street again.

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll give you one last chance.

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Miss, I've never seen you so innocent.

162
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,120
It's amazing.

163
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,640
What is this?

164
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,400
This is the pure snow grass.

165
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,920
It's very effective for the pain and swelling of the skin.

166
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,200
Take a look.

167
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
This time,

168
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
for what happened this time.

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,799
To show our sincerity,

170
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,919
as compensation,

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,559
Here's a triple compensation.

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,360
And this supreme card and this card.

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,640
I’ll give you 50% off

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
will be 50% off.

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
Every day

176
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,880
doing business like roller coaster.

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,640
Honey, thanks to you,

178
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,320
thanks to you.

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Let's continue selling tomorrow.

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Who said it's all settled?

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,440
You...

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
From tomorrow onwards,

183
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,880
from tomorrow on.

184
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,360
Why?

185
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
What do you mean? You want to kick him out?

186
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Leader, don’t kick me out.

187
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
Nothing can be done without rules.

188
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,120
He made such a big mistake. He must be fired.

189
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,840
We live in the martial world with the word "righteousness".

190
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,880
If you want to kick him out,
