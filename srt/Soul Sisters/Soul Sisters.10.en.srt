1
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,400
Okay. I'll do it. Okay.

2
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
Practice in summer.

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,080
I've mastered a good skill.

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,440
I could pull mountains down with main and might

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
A tiger fight on the mountain, Wu Song.

6
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,960
As the saying goes,

7
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,360
Isn't this too eye-catching?

8
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,440
I run Black Tiger Hideout.

9
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,160
Who dares to covet my bracelet?

10
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,200
I got a batch of fabrics today.

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,200
It'll be inconvenient for you to wear it, right?

12
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,000
Honey, are you questioning my ability to do it?

13
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,600
Wait.

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
It's no big deal to play with guns.

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,520
I didn't mean that.

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,240
Here.

17
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
You made this?

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,560
I developed it.

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Which little princess would refuse the luxury of fur?

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Put it on.

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,000
If you like it, mass production immediately.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Good idea.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
Can you give me freedom to control you?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,160
Dear.

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,320
I'll show you the techniques of Black Tiger Stronghold.

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
No need.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,120
I will never doubt your ability.

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,640
It's just that it's cold.

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
I was afraid your hand would be cold, so...

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm in the way. Let me take it off for you.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Thank you, honey. You're so nice to me.

33
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,320
Come here. And here.

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,640
Be careful and here

35
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,320
Put it over there

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,720
Guys at the back, hurry up.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,280
I owe you money.

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,000
No.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,240
Then why are you glaring at me?

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Gloves.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
You like this?

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
My husband gave it to me.

43
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,480
But brothers are like siblings. Men are like clothes.

44
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,480
If you like it,

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll give it to you.

46
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,440
Don't be shy.

47
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,320
This is the critical moment for us to revive our fortress.

48
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Don't give up your will

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,640
because of these trivial things.

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,640
Come on, bro.

51
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,960
Grandma, look carefully.

52
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,560
If a man

53
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,400
to another man,

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
Are you sick?

55
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
What disease?

56
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,080
It's...

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
It's...

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
fall in love with your brother.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,240
You are really sick.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
You're sick.

61
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
No.

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
You're sick.

63
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,320
No.

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,840
You're sick.

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
No.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
Crazy.

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
Young Master Rong,

68
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
This is a letter of investment left by the government office.

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
This is the painting

70
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
from his belongings.

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Mr. Gu's flute is really...

72
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,760
It's so loud and loud.

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,120
It makes me want to play a song with you.

74
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,880
That's a good compliment. Don't praise me next time.

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,800
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
I have something important to do. Don't go.

77
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,440
What is it? Tell me.

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,280
I must be sick recently.

79
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,160
I always have an ulterior motive towards brothers.

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,520
Hush.

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,280
Why is Zhao Mu

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,240
go to the back mountain sneakily?

83
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Where’s Leader?

84
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Where is she?

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,320
She asked Mr. Zhao out for business.

86
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Mr. Zhao, you want to see the sample of the clothes?

87
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
Why did you choose this place?

88
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,680
This place is spacious and bright.

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
So there won't be any color difference.

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,760
Be careful, Miss Bai.

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
Are you okay?

92
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,680
As long as Miss Bai is safe,

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,840
so what if I'm shattered to pieces?

94
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
You're so nice to me.

95
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't know how to repay you.

96
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,160
I wish to have one person's heart.

97
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,640
Maybe this is destiny.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Let us meet and know each other

99
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,960
Only one trick to save the beauty

100
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,039
I'll fall in love with you.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,440
Mr. Zhao, you want to see the sample of the clothes?

102
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,080
Why did you choose this place?

103
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
This place is spacious and bright.

104
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,920
So there won't be any color difference.

105
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,880
Be careful, Miss Bai.

106
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,840
Are you okay?

107
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,080
I'm fine.

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
Mr. Zhao, are you okay?

109
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,480
As long as Miss Bai is safe,

110
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,520
so what if I'm smashed into pieces?

111
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Nice work.

112
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,680
Mr. Zhao, you've worked so hard.

113
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
You designed this?

114
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Let's go.

115
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Miss Bai.
