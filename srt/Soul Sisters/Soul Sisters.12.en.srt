1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,240
Brother Gu made another contribution today.

2
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,760
I feel so relieved.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Mr. Gu, you are really our benefactor.

4
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Thanks to him,

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
Everyone's life is getting better.

6
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,240
I'm flattered.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,280
I'm flattered.

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
Guys, I have something to tell you.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
Since my husband came to Black Tiger Hideout,

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,280
he has made countless contributions.

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,039
The position of the second head is vacant.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
I have an idea.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
to propose him to be our Second Master.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,720
What do you think?

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,640
Okay.

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,840
Don't be idle. What about me?

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Tiger.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,759
You made such a big mistake.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,039
Don't be a demon.

20
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,160
They won't allow you.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,640
Even if I fail,

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,960
even if I can't.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
According to the rules,

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,000
if you want to sacrifice the pillar for Black Tiger Fortress,

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,120
we need a recommendation

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,840
and go through hell.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
to prove his sincerity.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,400
to join us.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,640
I can protect him.

30
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,440
As for the punishment,

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,680
you are so delicate.

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
Can you stand it?

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
I’m willing to try.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,079
to take the position of the second head

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
to get the map sooner.

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
According to the rules,

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,480
we need to cross the sea of fire

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,240
and climb the mountain of swords.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
and finally get the banner.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Honey.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,880
Don’t worry. I’ll be careful.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Brother Gu.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,720
Please.

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,440
Be careful.

45
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
Watch out, Gu.

46
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,440
Can you bite yourself?

47
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Sorry.

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,280
All I think about is Gu.

49
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,960
Okay.

50
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Honey.

51
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,080
How are you?

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,960
Are you okay?

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Your hand...

54
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,240
It's cloudy.

55
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm glad you're fine.

56
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,440
My husband got the banner

57
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
successfully pass.

58
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
From today onwards,

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
he is the second head of Black Tiger Hideout.

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,560
Congratulations on your return.

61
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,920
Congratulations!

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Second Master.

63
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Fortunately, we prepared in advance.

64
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,240
Otherwise, we would have killed you.

65
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,960
Didn't you expect that you would get hurt?

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,159
It's nothing.

67
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,120
I'll do my best

68
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I will do my best.

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,320
I'd rather not be the Second Master.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Let me tell you.

71
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,200
Wang Hu's expression today

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
It's so dark.

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
So funny.

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
He's lucky.

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
If I hadn't rushed back to treat you,

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
I would have killed him.

77
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Don't be angry.

78
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,000
You.

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
Who is it?

80
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Show me if you dare.

81
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,480
Please spare my life.

82
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,640
Stop fighting!

83
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,240
How dare you cheat in secret?

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Tiger Shou.

85
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm not Tiger.

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,080
How dare you hit me?

87
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,919
I got you, the kitchen thief!

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
So you were eating secretly.

89
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,960
Today, because of me,

90
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
because of me.

91
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,880
So I came here to get you something to eat.

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
You made this?

93
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,400
I don't know who did it.

94
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,920
But it's yours now.

95
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh no.

96
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,400
The roast chicken is here.

97
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,600
That's strange.

98
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,680
I put the roasted chicken here.

99
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,520
Can it fly?

100
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,920
Where's the chicken?

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
Where's the chicken?

102
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,000
Well...

103
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
Eat this.

104
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,000
It's quality.

105
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
The style is new.

106
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,080
It's a batch of good goods.

107
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,960
It can be handed over.

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
It seems that

109
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,240
we can have a new year

110
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,120
our village will have a new year.

111
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,040
Look at you.

112
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
This is nothing.

113
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,720
As long as my husband and I are here,

114
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,760
we can be strong

115
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
and dominate the country.

116
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
and lead the world.

117
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,280
Right, honey?

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,520
Now our goods are in the market.

119
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,520
As long as we keep progressing,

120
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,440
and ensure

121
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,680
will make a fortune in the future.

122
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,120
Who's outside?

123
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
I smell gunpowder.
