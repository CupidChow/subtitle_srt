1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
There are so many boxes.

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,480
Look.

3
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,200
Open the box, guys.

4
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Mr. Gu is generous.

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,120
Heihu Stronghold is powerful.

6
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,680
is really impressive.

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,480
It takes a minute to accept a bank.

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
That's right.

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,000
You know them?

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,800
So what?

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,240
So what?

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,920
You were the one

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,560
was also your doing.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,320
You are stupid and rich.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
Don't blame me.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,680
You set up this trap

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
to squeeze out a large amount of cash.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,080
Zhao Mu heard that I bought a lot of stores

19
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,400
he started to take action.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,320
Did he really stop us?

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
I've told all the shops owners

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,800
to pay Zhao Mu a high price for the acquisition.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840
Once Zhao Mu has no money,

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,440
he'll definitely come after Concubine Liu.

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
Can the bank have that much money?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,759
Of course not.

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,759
So,

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,040
We need to feed it.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,600
Send someone to save money inside.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Once Zhao Mu embezzles the money,

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,320
send someone to squeeze the money out,

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Zhao Mu will be a red ass monkey.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He'll be burnt to death.

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,160
Pay me back!

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,680
He set me up. Ask him for money.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,120
Pay me back!

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,160
Zhao Mu.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,120
I advise you to find a way to pay the money back.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Otherwise, if the government finds out,

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,760
not only will your bank be confiscated,

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
you'll also go to jail.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,240
Young Master.

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,200
Young Master.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,760
If you beg me,

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,079
I can buy your bank

46
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,440
to buy your bank.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,120
your crisis will be solved today.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,080
Bank.

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Kneel down and beg me.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,880
and promise not to appear in business again.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
Or I’ll make you go bankrupt

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll make you go bankrupt.

53
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,720
The bank

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
is yours.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
What?

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,280
I have no name?

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,120
Gu Jinyu.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The bank

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,200
is yours.

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,440
Exchange the votes.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,760
It's all over.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,520
Here's the money.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
Brothers and sisters,

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,960
The business of Heihu Stronghold is the top in the city now.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,840
Okay.

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,560
I announce

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,399
the annual bonus meeting of Heihu Hideout

68
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,320
starts now.

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
OK.

70
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,200
Line up, everyone.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll go first.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,720
Thank you.

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,400
Take it.

74
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,960
Here.

75
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,600
Uncle Zhang.

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,720
I’m old enough to get money.

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
Everyone in Black Tiger Stronghold

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
will get dividends.

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Like father, like daughter.

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Good job.

81
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,880
Okay.

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Here.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,000
Xiao Tian Hu, pay the money.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,080
Here.

85
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Catch it.

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Why are you here?

87
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,120
Isn’t it your wish

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,000
Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted?

89
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
But you don't seem happy.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm happy.

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I just

92
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,800
think of my father.

93
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,720
If my father is still alive,

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,159
I can share my happiness with him.

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,400
Why?

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,600
I want to share your happiness with your father.

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,280
Because my father loves me the most in the world.

98
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
When I was young,

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,800
no matter what I wanted,

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,840
my father will try his best to give it to me.

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
If I did something wrong,

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,320
My father doesn't blame me.

103
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
He would find excuses for me.

104
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
When I'm unhappy,

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
Dad will always be with me.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,200
But now,

107
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
when I was the happiest,

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
I couldn't tell him.

109
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,159
It's okay.

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,080
From now on,

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,840
I'll be with you.

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's go down the mountain and play.

113
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,600
When we have money, we should spend it freely.

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Let's go.

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
Take a look.

116
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,920
Monkey King versus Piggy.

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,400
Look.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
It's so fun.

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
Yes.

120
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Can I borrow your shadow puppet play later?

121
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Sure.

122
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,280
Wait for me here.

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Where are you going?

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm going to put on a good show.

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,560
Rumor has it that

126
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,840
named Zhu Yingtai.

127
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,600
She disguised herself as a man and entered the academy.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
and met her classmate, Liang Shanbo.

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,440
Liang Zhu has been classmates for three years.

130
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
They study together during the day.

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,600
and sleep together at night.

132
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
Liang Shanbo saw Zhu Yingtai had ears piercing.

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
So he asked

134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,840
Yingtai is not a woman.

135
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
Why are there rings on your ears?

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,800
There's a reason for the earrings.

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
Why do you suspect Yun?

138
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,360
There are many temples in the village.

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,920
I'll be Guanyin every year.

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,480
I don't dare to look at Guanyin anymore.

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,320
They fell in love with each other gradually.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
I don't know how Zhu Yingtai

143
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,520
explain this lie to Liang Shanbo.

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,720
And Liang Shanbo

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,480
didn't know Zhu Yingtai was a girl.

146
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,160
Honey, why don't you continue?

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,440
Have you ever thought that...

148
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,880
What if

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,960
we are the same as them?

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,160
You mean hiding your real identity

151
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,400
and deceive each other?

152
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Actually,

153
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
I've been wanting to tell you something for a long time.

154
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,600
Yunxi, actually I...

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,280
Say no more.

156
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,920
I knew it.

157
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,040
I didn't expect

159
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,600
between us.

160
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,200
Dear.

161
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
Why do you think I'm lying to you?

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm a real woman.

163
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,480
Feel it if you don't believe me.

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
No, you don't understand.

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
I...

166
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
I know it too well.

167
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,040
No, you really don't understand.

168
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,480
I mean...

169
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,040
Don't be shy. Try it.

170
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm not shy. I just want to say

171
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,200
I must prove myself.

172
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,560
I...

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
I...

174
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,120
Look at the fireworks.

175
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Forget it.

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
Let's not disturb her today.

177
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
and find another chance to confess.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,920
Look at that.

179
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,800
So beautiful.

180
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,480
Six six eight horses

181
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,880
Two brothers are good. Six, six, six.

182
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,360
Honey.

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,920
Do you think it's too noisy here?

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,440
I just didn't expect

185
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,760
the Spring Festival

186
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,320
It's so lively.

187
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,320
It's New Year. It's lively.

188
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,840
to drive away the Nian.

189
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Nian?

190
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,040
Nian is the loneliness in your heart.

191
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
But after you have family and friends,

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,680
I won't.

193
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
Here, take some food for you.

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
The Nian in my heart must be very fierce.

195
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
So no one can drive him away.

196
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,880
Thank you.

197
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,600
Master.

198
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Uncle Zhang is here.

199
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,320
Uncle Zhang, what took you so long?

200
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
I’m not here for hot pot.

201
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
I’m here to fulfill the old chief’s order.

202
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,600
Uncle Zhang.

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,920
Did my father leave me a gold mountain?

204
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,440
Actually, my real identity is the richest man in the city.

205
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,520
The old chief told me

206
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,960
to give you the secret treasure

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
I'll give you the secret treasure of Black Tiger Stronghold.

208
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,800
I can finally complete the task today.

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
A secret treasure.

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Uncle Zhang.

211
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,040
Are you serious?

212
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,840
Open it.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,880
The treasure map.
