1
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,680
Xiao Tian Hu.

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you sure you put all my things in place?

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Don't worry. I've taken them back.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Boss.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
Look at my goods.

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,280
The fireworks

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,160
80 copper cash per bundle.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,160
50 copper cash per jar of fine wine.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,880
Look at the salty meat.

10
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,080
40 copper cash per catty.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,920
It's so much lower than the market price.

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm talking about

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
is a small profit.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
Beautiful and cheap.

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,760
Let me have a look.

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,960
Look.

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,360
These good things are so cheap.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,680
Not bad.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,360
Boss

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,400
I want 500 taels

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,039
Okay.

22
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,360
Boss, I'll take all of these.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
I've brought the money.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,440
Look.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:38,960
Boss.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,400
You really don't want it?

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,960
If you really don't want it,

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,280
I'll give them to you.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,120
Wait.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,640
What's wrong?

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,080
Who said I won't buy it?

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
First come, first served.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,560
I'll take all these goods.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,440
Okay.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,160
Wait.

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,560
Sir,

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,000
don't fall for the trap for the cheap.

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,680
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
I'll lure you into the trap with good goods.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
and find some boys to pretend to buy it.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
When you paid and received the goods,

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,560
they would have escaped.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
It's all water.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,880
Who are you to be nosy?

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,240
Let's go.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Thank you for your help.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm new here.

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,360
I hope you can recommend a safe place

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,440
to buy new year's goods.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
What a coincidence.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,240
We are in the New Year's goods business.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,080
If you trust us,

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,360
I can trust you.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,840
But my order is huge.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,280
I need to check the goods first

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,560
before we confirm the cooperation.

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
No problem. You can come anytime.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Great!

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,560
You're amazing, honey.

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,640
I didn't expect you

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
you could make such a big deal.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Darling, look at this.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
Brother.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Brother!

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Oh no, it's an illegitimate brother.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Why is he here?

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Brother.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,880
I must be really handsome.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,240
You can eat all of them.

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
Let me hug you.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
Give me a hug.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,200
You know each other?

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
Whose child is this?

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,079
You're so sweet.

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,800
Why don't you...

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Be good.

77
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
Have some candies.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,640
He's alone.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
He's not by his side.

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,840
He must be lost.

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,760
His parents must be worried about him.

82
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,200
Let's split up and look for him.

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,560
Come.

84
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Let's go.

85
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,159
Brother.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,800
Spit it out.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,240
You're a kid. You eat so much sugar.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,480
What did I tell you?

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,159
You gave it to me.

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
Why are you alone?

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
Where is Concubine Liu?

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,400
I got separated from my mother.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,040
Brother, where have you been these days?

94
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,200
I miss you so much.

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,280
My brother is out for some business.

96
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
He won't be back for the time being.

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,800
I'll send someone to send you home, okay?

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
Young Master. Young Master.

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
Send him back.

100
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't tell anyone about this.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,640
Have you seen me outside?

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,680
I understand.

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,760
My mother always hates how close I am to my brother.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go, young master.

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Here.

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
Goodbye, brother.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
Children are innocent.

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,200
Xiao Tian Hu's elbow is in your stomach again.

109
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
If you eat like this,

110
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
you might get indigestion.

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
He always hides one place.

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
He's so stupid.

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,120
I'm coming, my elbow baby.

114
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,120
Who?

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
Who keeps catching me stealing?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,600
Honey.

117
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,040
The day after tomorrow is the day

118
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,880
to inspect the new year's goods.

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,159
Why are you so calm?

120
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
Have you figured out a way?

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,080
No.

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,400
It hurts.

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,960
What's wrong?

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,680
I knew it.

125
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Wait for me here.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,320
Here, eat this.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,400
Isn't this wild fruit hallucinating?

128
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Do you want to

129
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
with me?

130
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,400
But it's not convenient for me today.

131
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
This is hawthorn

132
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
It's for digestion.

133
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,280
What are you thinking?

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,040
I won't eat it. I won't eat it.

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
This is so sour.

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,360
I hate this.

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,760
I don't want it.

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Try it.

139
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
It's sweet and tasty and fragrant.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
This is syrup.

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
I lost my appetite when I was young.

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,320
my father found this prescription for me from outside.

143
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
I think

144
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
my father treated me well.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,160
It's good to use it.

146
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,520
It can be a snack

147
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
and healthy food therapy.

148
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,400
That's what I want.

149
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,160
Not only can we use hawthorns,

150
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,360
Orange petals.

151
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
Strawberry grapes and dates

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Anyway, everything is fine.

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,880
Then I'll give you a loud and interesting name.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Do you think it looks like a gourd?

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,880
It's called Tanghulu.

156
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Look.

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,400
This is our new new year product.

158
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
These are peanuts and candied haws.

159
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,880
Popcorn, melon seeds, red dates and fruits.

160
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,680
Let's sign the agreement.

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
This is the deposit I gave you first.

162
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,280
Deal.

163
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Just wait and see.
