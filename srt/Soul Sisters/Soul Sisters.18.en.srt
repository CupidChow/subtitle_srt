1
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,440
I am the second head of Black Tiger Hideout.

2
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
It's all because of you and Gu Jinyu

3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,880
because of you and Gu Jinyu.

4
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,040
You were the person my father trusted the most.

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,880
You even tried to kill me for power.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,280
You deserve it.

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Gu Jinyu.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
No matter what it takes,

9
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,640
I'll beat you.

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,200
I thought I could kill Gu Geun-woo if I join hands with you.

11
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,560
I didn't expect

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,039
It's nothing.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Say it again.

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
What's the use of getting mad at me?

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,920
Can you turn the tide?

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,520
Forget it.

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
Let's drink to drown our sorrows.

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,160
As long as Gu Jinyu dies,

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,039
you can take the position of master.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,960
And I can become a great Jia.

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,759
Instead of living a life,

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,560
I'd rather give it a go.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,680
If Gu Jinyu doesn't come,

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,479
I'll freeze to death.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,480
and ate Gu Jinyu's flesh.

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,079
not only will he be in agony,

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
I can be the leader.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,079
Kill two birds with one stone.

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,920
You're unlucky.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
I didn't want to kill you.

31
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Don't worry.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll send you back soon.

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
You want to hurt my husband.

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,920
Leader.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Take care.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,560
I wanted to kill you.

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,800
How dare you!

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Fine.

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Don't blame me for being cruel.

40
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,520
Don't move.

41
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
Sorry, I'm late.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,320
Wang Hu wants to harm you.

43
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,880
Leave now.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,720
Clouds

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,160
Yun.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,840
You have no idea who you messed with.

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,360
You really have a different identity.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Yun,

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Bring me the best imperial physician

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,840
and the best medicine here.

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Yes.

52
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,520
Fortress, Tiger, Black.

53
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Imperial physician.

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,640
Young Master.

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,360
How is it?

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
His life is safe for now.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,720
We don't know when he will wake up.

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
We need to observe for a few days.

59
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,880
Sister.

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,000
Sister.

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Yunxi is still unconscious.

62
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,880
Let her rest.

63
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
What happened?

64
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Who did this to my sister?

65
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Wang Hu's ambush should be targeting me.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,720
But I didn't expect that Yun Xi would be killed.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,000
I already threw him off the cliff.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,920
No.

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
Even if he dies,

70
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
I will drag him out and kill him a few more times.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,440
and avenge you.

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
God has eyes.

73
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,159
I won't let you

74
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,240
to vent my hatred.

75
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
You will never die again.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,320
If I wasn't lucky,

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,400
a tree

78
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,360
I'll be smashed into pieces.

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
I asked you to kill Gu Jinyu.

80
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,400
Who allowed you to touch the clouds?

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
What do you mean?

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
You mean

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,400
you pissed me off.

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,800
Do you know how important she is to me?

85
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,320
We're on the same side.

86
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,000
You're going to die anyway.

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,720
I'll be honest with you.

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,280
The warehouse exploded.

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,680
And I was behind your back when you were kicked out.

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
You fool!

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Young Master!

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
This operation has made a big deal.

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,480
Master Rong is suspicious of your behavior in Black Tiger Stronghold.

94
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,960
On the contrary, Concubine Liu didn't take any action.

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,080
It seems calm,

96
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,040
but the Dark Tide is flooding.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,280
Since we left White Dragon City,

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
we might have seen her all along.

99
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,440
Gu,

100
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Wang Hu didn't die when he fell off the cliff.

101
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,240
He didn't die. Where is he?

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,640
Then he died.

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,040
I saw Zhao Mu push him off the cliff.

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
He also said that the explosion

105
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,320
was manipulated by him.

106
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,640
It's too far away.

107
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,560
I didn't hear it clearly.

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
Zhao Mu.

109
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,280
He made me remember him.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,320
I swear I will make him pay with his blood.

111
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,360
and no place to stay.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,200
I'll go check on my sister.

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
Concubine Liu can't do nothing.

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Unless she has found someone

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
Find out her relationship with Zhao Mu.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,280
Yes.

117
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
Zhao Mu.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
Yun.

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
I have a lot to tell you.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,080
and many things to do with you.

121
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,600
Our album

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,400
There are so many blanks

123
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,120
waiting for us to fill them up together.

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I know you're tired.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
You can take a day off.

126
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
A year?

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,600
But please don't sleep like this.

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,360
Okay?

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Come on.

130
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
Great!

131
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,280
Great!

132
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,400
You're awake.

133
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,680
You have so many things to do with me.

134
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
I don't want to sleep anymore.

135
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
I failed to protect you.

138
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
I promise you.

139
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,800
I will never leave you.

140
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
I won't put you in danger again.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
Don't be sad.

142
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,040
When I recover,

143
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll hang it on you every day.

144
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,760
Okay.

145
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,640
The chaos just started.

146
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
The blood of the five organs is irregular.

147
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,400
You can take this medicine to calm your nerves.

148
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

149
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Take some medicine.

150
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,720
When I recover,

151
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
can you go out with me?

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
There's something I don't understand.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,560
Why can you mobilize the imperial physician

154
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,880
to treat me?

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,400
and sent guards to protect me.

156
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,040
Actually, you're the young master of White Dragon City,

157
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,360
right?

158
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,280
Yun.

159
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,920
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

160
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Actually, I've been looking for an opportunity to explain to you.

161
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
No matter who you are,

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
you are still my husband.

163
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
I have you in my heart.

164
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
You have me in your heart.

165
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
That's enough.

166
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,080
Don't you blame me for lying to you?

167
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
After going through so much,

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,520
I know you love me.

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,880
You have your reasons.

170
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,240
I understand.

171
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,160
You can tell me

172
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
you can tell me.

173
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,680
If one day

174
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
you know I'm here for the treasure map,

175
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,080
and my identity as a woman,

176
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
[and my daughter?]
