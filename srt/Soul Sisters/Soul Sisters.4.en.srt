1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Time to sell pastries

2
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,720
Pastries

3
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,120
Madam

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Fresh flower cake

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
No need

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,720
Have a taste.

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,080
Have a piece of youth forever.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,640
Two pieces to grow old and be a child

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,600
Yes.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,040
Yes

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
The taste is

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
Really good

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Have a piece

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,560
Have a bite

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,400
Have a piece.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,000
Eat our flower cake.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,800
Madam.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
Business is bankrupt.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,320
Life is like a joke.

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,200
Poor thing.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,280
We're not beggars.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
What does she mean?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
That's too much.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,000
We're not beggars,

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,479
but we do need beggars to help us.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,920
Sir,

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,600
can you introduce your leader?

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,840
I want to make a deal with you.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,680
You want to see our boss with a shabby pastry?

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
What a joke.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
I told you to eat it. Eat it.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
It's good.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
It's delicious.

34
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
If the beggars are willing to help,

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,520
everyone can eat this free flower cake.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,760
And you, double.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay. Okay.

38
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,079
It's so delicious.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
How can there be such delicious flower cakes in the world?

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,720
Give me more.

41
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,680
No.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Our flower pastries are complex and material tests.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,920
So the quantity is limited.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
Only five for each person.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
Is it really that good?

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,440
Let me try.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,000
Me too.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,600
Line up

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,680
Line up, everyone.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can only buy five.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,480
Line up.

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,160
Everyone has it. Don't grab it.

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Line up.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,160
Alcohol is afraid of the deep alley

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
People around you

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,120
will affect your judgment.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
That's why it's necessary

58
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,280
By the way,

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,960
I made this flower cake for you.

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,040
I want to thank you.

61
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
Guys, congratulations.

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Let's celebrate the first bucket of gold in our life.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Cheers.

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
Okay.

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,520
You...

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
Our greatest contributor

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,400
is my husband, Gu Jinyu.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,440
Let's make a toast for him.

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,640
Where are the dishes?

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Braised pork elbow is here.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
Sit down.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
Can you take care of your image when you're out?

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
You are like bandits.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
Mine.

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,160
It's the first time for us to have a full meal.

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,520
How can you be so selfish?

77
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
Who cares about our leader?

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
The first bite should be for our master.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Leader.

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Take the chicken.

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,440
Master, we’re wrong.

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
Thank you, brothers.

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,360
Today, I swear with my elbow

85
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
I will make sure

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,880
with my husband.

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Eat and drink as much as you want.

88
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
Let's drink.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,880
Sixty-five.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,760
Another fifteen fifteen fifty five.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Master, our business has just improved.

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,520
We should reduce the capital.

93
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,040
This is a long-term plan just in case.

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,040
Worry about tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,360
How can you live a good life?

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,920
Look at the happiness and happiness now.

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,200
are the most real.

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,560
Come on.

99
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,360
Bottoms up. Help yourselves.

100
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,920
Come on.

101
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
Bottoms up, guys.

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,200
If I were a man,

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,280
it would be nice

104
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,520
to have a lovely wife like you.

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
My goodness.

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,560
My brother ate their flower cake.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,600
and died of poisoning.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,400
You have to be the judge.

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Brother.

110
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,480
Nonsense!

111
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,840
There's nothing wrong with our flower pastry.

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,360
I think you're here to extort money.

113
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Look carefully.

114
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,640
This is the half of the pastry my brother ate.

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Now we have witness and evidence.

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,280
Are you still trying to quibble?

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,360
It's really our flower cake.

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
If I'm fine after a bite,

119
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
it means you're lying.

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
Our pastries are fine

121
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,800
But I'm not sure now.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
Who knows if someone had tampered with it?

123
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,480
It's so pitiful.

124
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Brother.

125
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Call the police.

126
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
Who will make the decision?

127
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
You should pay for your mistakes.

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
You disregard human lives!

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,120
You disregard human lives!

130
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,720
I have to say you have something.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,360
You even hired someone who can shut his breath to pretend to be dead.

132
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,600
I almost pretended.

133
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,360
But you hit the iron board.

134
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,600
Why don't you ask about my background?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,760
Vinegar.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Fragrant grass.

137
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,840
It stinks.

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
In my opinion, he's faking his death.

139
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,320
Yes.

140
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,640
I've used this trick many times.

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
He must be faking his death.

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,240
I'll count to three.

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,720
If you don't wake up,

144
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
I'll let you die again.

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
How dare you!

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,840
My brother is dead.

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,360
Do you still want him to suffer in peace?

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,200
And you.

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,440
How can you do this?

150
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,600
You're wrongly accusing me.

151
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
He's already dead.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,560
What's going on?

153
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,560
He's dead.

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,080
Brother.

155
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
I didn't mean to offend you. Please forgive me.

156
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,920
When did you say he died of poisoning?

157
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,160
Last night at midnight. What?

158
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,080
You're lying.

159
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,560
If that's the case,

160
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,160
why is there a large area of mortis on his body?

161
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
A few days ago,

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,200
a few days ago.

163
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,840
Our flower pastry started selling yesterday.

164
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
How did your brother

165
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,160
eat our flower cakes?

166
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Besides, he has been dead for a long time.

167
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,360
That's why you covered his scent

168
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,080
to cover up his scent.

169
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,920
Tell me, who sent you here?

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
What's your motive?

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
I...

172
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,400
You won't tell me?

173
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,880
Fine.

174
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
I can only report it to the government.

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,200
Honey, you're really something.

176
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Yes.

177
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560
I admire you so much.

178
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,400
You're maliciously blackmailing. You should have reported it.

179
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
But for the sake of the deceased,

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,440
Leave.

181
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,080
You think you can cheat us?

182
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
You should've stayed here.

183
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,360
These liars.

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
Okay.

185
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Just go.

186
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
You just let him go?

187
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
The bait has been released.

188
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,120
Now, we're waiting for the fish to take the bait.

189
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,720
We really believed you.

190
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
We teamed up to fool her.

191
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,560
and almost got sued.

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,200
Shouldn't you give us more compensation?

193
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,800
You want money when you failed?

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm a bandit.

195
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
I'll kill you!

196
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,280
What? Do you want to try?

197
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Not here.

198
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,320
Kneel down.

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,680
I was just kidding.

200
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,480
Cut the crap.

201
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
Hurry up!

202
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,760
Take the money.

203
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
It's all because of you.

204
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,960
I don't want to let you go.

205
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Maybe it's good to pretend to be real.
