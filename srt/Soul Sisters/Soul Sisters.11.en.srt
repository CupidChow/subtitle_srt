1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,000
You reported it to the government

2
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,080
and tried to seduce the chief with an order.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,720
and put on a show to save the beauty.

4
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,280
Tell me what your intention is.

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,120
Is my name on it?

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
or my seal?

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,280
It can prove that I wrote it.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Let me see.

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,039
It's not here.

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
Which side are you on?

11
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,120
The words on it are exactly the same as the ones on it.

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
How do you explain it?

13
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,560
Let me see.

14
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,759
The woman on this painting looks a bit like me.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,640
And this bracelet.

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,479
This painting looks quite old.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,120
So you take me as a substitute.

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,960
Tell me why you came here.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Doctor, this is all I have.

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,720
Take it as charity and save her.

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
You don't have money to see a doctor.

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,400
Doctor.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,640
Yancao.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Forget it. This is my fate.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Thank you for being with me.

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,160
I can leave happily now.

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,880
No.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
Don't leave me.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,520
Yancao.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Yancao.

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Fortunately, no one knows about our relationship.

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,120
You must get rid of Gu Jinyu as soon as possible.

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
The position of Young Master

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,080
will fall into your nephew's hands.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Don't worry, sister.

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
In business,

37
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,640
in business.

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
Before I kill him,

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
before I kill him.

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
and make him remember my name.

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Bye.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,720
Take care.

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,120
From now on, I'll take you to all kinds of places

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
and enjoy delicious food.

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
We'll be together forever.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
Tell me.

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,840
Who are you? What's your purpose?

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
I'll tear it apart if you don't tell me.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
No, no, no.

50
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
I said I admit I did it.

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
Don't tear it.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,600
How dare you make a scene in my place!

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
Xiao Tian Hu, beat him out of the fortress!

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's go.

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
Gu Jinyu, I couldn't win in business before.

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,040
but not now.

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,760
The duel between us has just begun.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
This time,

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,159
this time.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,600
I lost too much in business.

61
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,120
Who are you? Do I know you?

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Is there any grudge between us?

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,000
You...

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,840
You've gone too far. Let's wait and see.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Honey, you've done a great job again.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,400
I saw a lot of wild fruits on the back mountain.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Can you go pick some with me?

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
I want to go too.

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
No, you don't want to.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,840
I'll go by myself.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,640
It suddenly rained heavily.

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
Luckily, I picked some fruits.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
It seems that it won't stop for a while.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
This is so sweet. Try it.

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
It's really sweet.

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,320
Is it sweet?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
Now that I think about it,

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
the first half of my life

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,159
doesn't seem to know what sweetness is.

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,040
Father always said that the more beautiful things are,

81
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,640
the more dispirited you are.

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
So since young,

83
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,240
all people related to happiness

84
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,440
and things

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,360
has nothing to do with me.

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,360
It's hard to imagine what you've been through.

87
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
You must be in pain.

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
It's like I'm stuck in a swamp.

89
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
Only keep trying

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
and keep climbing up.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,040
You have to be nervous all the time

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
so that I won't suffocate.

93
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,480
It's okay. You have me now.

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,280
I'll make you happy every day.

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,880
I'll let you soak in the honey cans for the rest of your life.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll be with you all the time.

97
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Knowing you

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,200
is the only sweetness in my life.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,480
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

100
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,080
I...

101
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,840
Oh no, this fruit will hallucinate.

102
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,240
There's a rabbit on your head.

103
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,159
A rabbit?

104
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
You have a rabbit too?

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,159
Why did it fly up?

106
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
So the rabbit can fly.

107
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,040
Was what happened last night a dream?

108
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,640
She must have forgotten what happened last night.

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,400
Last night?

110
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,960
I was so scared last night.

111
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
You two ate wild fruits to hallucinate.

112
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,280
It's all because you're handsome and handsome.

113
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,720
I found it in time

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,680
and carried you back.

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
Thank you.

116
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,640
I forgot about it.

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Thank you.

118
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
I see.

119
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,920
Thank you

120
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
for being handsome and handsome

121
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
and acknowledged me.

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,280
Time to work, guys.

123
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,360
Come and have a look.

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,240
Look

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
Shameless!

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,880
How dare you copy our women's clothes?

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Don’t say that.

128
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,680
We just think alike.

129
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,800
If there's a similarity, then there's no way we'll be able to escape. That's right.

130
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
is just a coincidence.

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
But you are one coin lower than us.

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,680
It's a coincidence.

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,880
Of course.

134
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,680
Looks like you're determined

135
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,120
to compete with us.

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,200
He not only plagiarized our idea,

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
but also low-price sales and malicious competition.

138
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
We were caught off guard.

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm going to sue him.

140
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,120
Since ancient times,

141
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
creativity is the most difficult to distinguish.

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,680
We can't sue him without evidence.

143
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
I don't believe

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,920
A clearance sale!

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,200
A dress costs 280 copper cash.

146
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
280 copper cash. Take a look.

147
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
Come and have a look.

148
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Come and have a look.

149
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
A set of women's clothes costs 250 copper cash.

150
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,880
I think you're 250.

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
Let me tell you.

152
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
our customers are the most loyal.

153
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
No one can escape.

154
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Okay.

155
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,600
Are you playing a price war with us?

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
I, Baiyun, accept the challenge.

157
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,320
A set of women's clothes costs 220 copper cash.

158
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,720
180.

159
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,840
180.

160
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,960
160.

161
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
I advise you

162
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,120
you'll lose the cost if you break the price again.

163
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,200
Gu Jinyu.

164
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
As long as I can defeat you once,

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
So what if it's broken?

166
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,160
130.

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,360
100 pence.

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
50 copper cash.

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Are you sure the price is down?

170
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,880
Yes. Are we going to lower it or not?

171
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
Yes, will you surrender or not?

172
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
Will you surrender?

173
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,280
Gu Jinyu, I can finally beat you once.

174
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,160
Find some men to pretend to be customers.

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,600
to wipe out his goods

176
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
at the low price.

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,120
If you didn't mean to suppress us,

178
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
you wouldn't have fallen into such a simple trap.

179
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,760
Now you broke the price and lost money,

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
we are the only women's clothes in the market.

181
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm afraid we'll make a lot of money.

182
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,400
A set of women's clothes is still 299 copper cash.

183
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,080
Gu Jinyu, you won't be too proud for too long.

184
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,760
I have something on you.

185
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,480
Sooner or later,

186
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
I will defeat you at the right time.

187
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
Really?

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,240
Then I will...

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,280
What's his name again?

190
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
I think his name is Zhao Mu.

191
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,880
waiting for you.

192
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
You've gone too far!

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,320
I swear.

194
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,640
I will defeat you at all costs.

195
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,440
Let's thank

196
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

197
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,160
You
