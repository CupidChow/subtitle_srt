1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,320
The wedding night.

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,040
Honey, it's time to get down to business.

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,760
Before that,

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,440
you have to untie me first.

5
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,920
You're right.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
You can't run away in my place.

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,800
Sister.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Everything is ready.

9
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,440
Let's talk outside.

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,240
A good sword needs blood sacrifice. Do it.

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,080
Are you really going to do this?

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Don't be merciful if you're from Heihu Stronghold.

13
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,880
Kill him.

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,680
Looks like she's going to kill the donkey.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,280
I have to do it first.

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
Honey, I kicked him out.

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,280
Now, no one can disturb us.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,800
I've been curious about something.

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,000
Go ahead.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,759
Why me?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,280
I’m the most domineering master in the world.

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,039
Of course my husband

23
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,680
the most handsome man in the world.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,840
So you like my face?

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,200
So handsome. I’m excited.

26
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,800
But I have to be reserved.

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,320
Although you are pretty,

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,840
my father said

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,960
the more handsome a man is, the better he lies.

30
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,680
Since you married into the Black Tiger Stronghold,

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
you must abide by the virtue of your husband.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Familiar virtue.

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
First,

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,560
your name should be mine.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Your name will be Bai Gu Group from now on.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,040
Second,

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
when you have a child, you have to take my surname.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,040
In the end, the whole village is mine.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
You have to listen to me.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
The pig is ready.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
No wonder I couldn't find it.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,440
It's here.

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,480
Of course, I'll be loyal to you.

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
I'll do whatever I say.

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,120
I won't lie to you, I won't scold you, I won't hit you.

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
or bully you.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,760
As long as I have a bite,

48
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,320
as long as I have food.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,240
I’m the leader

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,120
in this world.

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,200
You’re so shameless.

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
The chief asked me

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,760
he asked me to kill

54
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,800
in the village for you.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
In that case,

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Let's enjoy it together.

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,640
It smells so good

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,280
I almost forgot what pork tastes like.

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Guys, meat is ready.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,079
Wait!

61
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
Xiao Tian Hu, I'll kill you if you dare to snatch the meat!

62
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,880
Stop!

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
Xiao Tian Hu, you've gone too far!

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,360
I saved your chrysanthemum.

65
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
What do you mean?

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,200
Looks like the pig has added a lot of ingredients.

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,720
Get some rest.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll investigate this matter.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,040
Xiao Tian Hu, why did you add the ingredients without permission?

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,760
Godfather asked me to take good care of you before he died.

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know who that toy boy is.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,080
He doesn't deserve you at all.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,480
I added some soybeans to teach him a lesson.

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,760
He’s my husband now.

75
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,800
You hurt our men.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
according to the rules.

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,560
I don’t care.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
I don't recognize him as my brother.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,560
Not again.

80
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Now Concubine Liu is coveting

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,480
with her son's status.

82
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
The assassin must be related to her.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm afraid something might happen to my internal force.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,240
Besides, I haven't obtained the map.

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,200
how can I calm my father down?

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,960
Remember, you are a woman.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
You're my only son.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,680
If you want to inherit White Dragon City,

89
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
don't let anyone

90
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,400
your real identity.

91
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Never show up

92
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,320
will never appear in the mansion again.

93
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Understand?

94
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Congratulations, Master Rong.

95
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,520
Concubine Liu gave birth to a young master with a belt.

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Sure.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,240
I have a successor.

98
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,800
Guards!

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,880
Everyone in the mansion will be rewarded.

100
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Congratulations, Master Rong.

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
We can only play along

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,920
to hide my identity and look for the map.

103
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,760
Honey.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,920
You've been washing for so long.

105
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,240
Are you done?

106
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
I heard water just now.

107
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Why are you dressed so quickly?

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
What? You seem disappointed.

109
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,680
You think too much.

110
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
Well, you are already my husband.

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,840
You must consummate tonight.

112
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,280
To consummate?

113
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,200
Just sleeping together.

114
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,280
Don't be afraid.

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
I won't force you.

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,840
We're just roommates.

117
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Why should I be afraid?

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,280
But Leader,

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,000
I’ve seen

120
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,760
I’ve been through a lot.

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,720
Why would I be afraid of such a trivial matter?

122
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,040
Okay, it's getting late.

123
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,240
Why don't you rest early?

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
If I retreat,

125
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
it’ll be embarrassing.

126
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,840
Second Master will make a big fuss again.

127
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,800
The more I refuse,

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,960
the more likely she'll suspect me.

129
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
But what if he...

130
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
But if she treats me...

131
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll sleep on the bed.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,880
No.

133
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
How can you let a boy sleep on the bed?

134
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Darn it.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,600
Gu Jinyu.

136
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,680
I'll avenge my sister!

137
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,000
Who are you?

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,200
Tiger Shou.

139
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
You're here to lie on the wall too?

140
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
Why are you here?

141
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,320
You are all here.

142
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
What are you looking at? Let's go.

143
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,240
Let's go.

144
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,840
You too.

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,640
We are not enemies.

146
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
We are both women.

147
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm in charge of a city.

148
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,120
and you support a fortress.

149
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
I think

150
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,400
it's not easy.

151
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,280
He weighed 180 kg when he went up the mountain.

152
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
Not even zero.

153
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,400
And this one.

154
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
He was a gentleman when he went up the mountain.

155
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,320
came to Black Tiger Hideout for only two years.

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Look how tormented he is.

157
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,840
Rumors are not believable.

158
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
Black Tiger Stronghold is not as poor as a bandit's den.

159
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
It's like a refugee shelter.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,040
Second Master, what do you want to say?

161
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to seek justice for everyone.

162
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Black Tiger Fortress has no money or food.

163
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
As the head of the Fortress,

164
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,800
you never led us to rob and get rich.

165
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,960
You don't deserve the position.

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,960
You should step down.

167
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
How can you give it to me?

168
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,600
I won’t be the leader.

169
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,680
Don’t try to sow discord between me and my sister.

170
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,320
I see.

171
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,280
The Xian you mentioned

172
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,640
is you?

173
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,200
The Black Tiger Village has been running for so many years.

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,080
My father must have left some money behind.

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,840
My husband is proficient in business.

176
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,160
He will help us gather funds

177
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,360
and make our village prosper again.

178
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,680
OK.

179
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Cool.

180
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,120
How can you be so proud of such a trivial thing?

181
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,400
Of course.

182
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,840
Since my father passed away,

183
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,920
the second head bullied an orphan like me.

184
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
But after you came,

185
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,720
I have the confidence.

186
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,880
I think

187
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,400
I didn't catch a husband.

188
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
but a carp.

189
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,800
We can definitely boost the fortress together.

190
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,760
I found your strength.

191
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
Focus on your attitude.

192
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,600
We need to check your father's ledger first.

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,680
I was so happy that I remembered.

194
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,560
My father left a will before he died.

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,560
When I really revive the fortress,

196
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,720
someone will give me the treasure.

197
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
Could it be the legendary treasure map?

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,560
Where is it?

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,960
Are you okay?

200
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Let me help you sit down.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
What's wrong? Are you okay?

202
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,600
I was poisoned by soft muscle powder.

203
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,640
It must be the poison.

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
Only by helping her revive the fortress

205
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,040
to get the map.

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,400
We need to find a way to make a contract with her.

207
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,760
Since we both have our own needs,

208
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
why don't we make a contract and pretend to be a couple?

209
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Leave the antidote to me.

210
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,640
Okay, I'll help you to boost the fortress.

211
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,760
so that we can live

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,840
and live a leftover life.

213
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,640
Deal.

214
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,640
Never change.
