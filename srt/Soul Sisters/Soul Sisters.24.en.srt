1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,280
Be careful.

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,800
Watch out!

3
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,680
Are you okay?

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,840
I smell sulphur.

5
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,360
This is a hot spring.

6
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,479
It's a treasure.

7
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,039
Here it is.

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,600
What kind of treasure is this?

9
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,039
Could the ancestors of Black Tiger Stronghold

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
made a joke for 100 years?

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
On the contrary,

12
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,600
our ancestors' wisdom is unpredictable.

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,360
If there are really thousands of treasures here,

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
it might cause trouble.

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,600
Dear.

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,280
You're forcing yourself to save your dignity again.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,079
Let go of me!

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,920
Master Rong.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,440
Master Rong, I know I was wrong.

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,840
For the sake that I've given birth to your children,

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
Please forgive me.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
Parents love their children.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
[they will plan for a long time.]

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
I understand

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,240
I understand.

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,200
But don't forget,

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Yu is also my child.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,760
Take him away.

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,840
Take him to the farm.

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes.

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm old.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
and my ideas are old.

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,920
I used to rule the city with iron wrist.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
Everyone was afraid of me,

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
but they don't respect me.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
And you

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
are kind-hearted

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
and resolved many grudges.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,720
It's time to take over my job.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Please withdraw your order.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
In the past,

42
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,040
living in the shackles of responsibility and expectations.

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
I've never lived for myself.

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,800
Now,

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,520
I just want to live for myself once.

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,960
and become a woman.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,079
My father is young and strong.

48
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,160
He can inherit the foundation.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,240
In the past,

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
I treated you harshly

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,640
and ignored your feelings.

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
I never even hugged you.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
It's my fault.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,560
Now,

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,160
do what you want to do.

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,280
Father.

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,000
Old Castellan.

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,120
These flowers and fruits are only for appreciation.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
What a pity.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Why don't we use it

61
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's make a deal together.

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
As the saying goes, you don't make money, king.

63
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,000
Not a good man.

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
I have to do this business.

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,159
Or I won't even be a hero.

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
God,

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,600
The earth is the proof.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
Today, we are sworn brothers.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
We will be united

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
and help each other.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Fortune and fortune are together.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
We'll live and die together.

73
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,040
This is the second master.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,080
Is it really her?

75
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,000
Is it her?

76
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,080
From now on,

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm no longer the Young Master of White Dragon City,

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,040
but the second head of Black Tiger Hideout.

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,720
Please teach me.

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Brothers.

81
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,800
The most important thing for us now

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
to develop the natural hot spring in our village.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
It's so sweet.

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
I've decided.

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,880
I'll only marry her in this life.

86
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
Thinking about it, I used to hold a grudge against her.

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,680
What a sin.

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,600
She will be the deity in my heart.

89
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,440
Look at you losers.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,720
You're turning against me faster than you are.

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
How ungrateful.

92
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
You should have principles.

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,720
The most important thing now is to change the fortress.

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,800
I hope you can work together.

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
I’ll do as you say.

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,600
I’ll do my best.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
Don't flatter me.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,560
There was a swing

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,840
in the City Governor's Residence.

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
Unfortunately, no one was willing to play with me.

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,280
Then I tore it down.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
It's okay.

103
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
You have me now.

104
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,120
You won't be lonely with me.

105
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,720
Let me push you.

106
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Sit tight.

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,920
Sister.

108
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,480
Let me do it.

109
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,840
Okay.

110
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,720
Sit tight.

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,440
Not bad Shooting Tiger, very strong.

112
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Look.

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,360
There are two flowers on this one.

114
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,240
These are twins.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
They are twins.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
They will be together

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
Live and die together.

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,840
That one is called Jinyu.

119
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,040
and the other is Yunxi.

120
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
What do you think?

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
It's all up to you.

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Then we won't take this one off.

123
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,320
Let’s take good care of it together.

124
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,360
Let me take care of the Second Master.

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,919
And sister.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
Put it over there.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,080
Put it here.

128
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,880
Be careful.

129
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
Look how nice I put it on.

130
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,480
Welcome.

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
Nice to meet you.

132
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760
It's good for your skin.

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Which one would you like?

134
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,640
Please come in.

135
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,320
I didn't expect the poor Black Tiger Stronghold

136
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,600
would be like this.

137
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,240
The business of the fortress is on track now.

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
Do you have any plans for the future?

139
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,000
I want to travel around the world

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
around the world.

141
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,760
Fill up

142
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,600
your picture book.

143
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,040
Your life is still long.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
We can plan it slowly.
