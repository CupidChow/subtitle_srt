1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
The old chief of Black Tiger Village passed away.

2
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,160
The new leader has unstable foundation and has endless internal strife.

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
I order you to go to Black Tiger Hideout

4
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
to get the treasure map

5
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
to solve the financial crisis in Bailing City.

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,880
Today’s merits are reduced.

7
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,640
I killed them successfully.

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
With you,

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,120
our reputation will be ruined forever.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,720
Get lost!

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,160
Young Master went to Black Tiger Hideout

12
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,479
to ambush people.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,640
He won't come back.

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,360
Young Master, run! I'll cover you.

15
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
I've been poisoned by soft tendon poison and lost all my internal force.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,920
Die!

17
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
Thank you for saving my life.

18
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,640
It's fine as long as you marry me.

19
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,280
That toy boy

20
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
was scared and fainted.

21
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,800
What toy boy?

22
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,560
The second head used me

23
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,880
against the rules,

24
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,480
against me being the new leader.

25
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,000
This time, I got married.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,079
Let's see what else he can do.

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,160
Go home.

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,840
Get married.

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,960
Where are you going?

30
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,320
I'm Gu Jinyu.

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
a businessman.

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
If you let me go,

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,079
I’ll give you 100 taels of silver.

34
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,160
100 taels is a lot.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,840
It's enough for us to live for half a year.

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,480
What else do you want?

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm so excited. It's hard to say no.

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
But no.

39
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,839
This time, people and money

40
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,680
both human and money.

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
Shameless! How dare you!

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,040
How did he know my name?

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,960
Shameless.

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
You're a girl. You're not ashamed at all.

45
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
What's there to be ashamed of looking for a man?

46
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
Brothers, dress up.

47
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
First, bow to God Kwan to ward off evil spirits and keep you safe.

48
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,200
Second, bow to Tamo, the auspicious star.

49
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,880
Third, bow to the God of Wealth. Good luck.

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
Bow to each other.

51
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,680
Today,

52
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Brother Gu and I are officially married.

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,800
We’ll share weal and woe.

54
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Let's eat meat and drink together.

55
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

56
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,560
Here. Drink this.

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,760
you'll officially become my husband.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,440
I'd rather die than be humiliated.

59
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Why don't you kill me?

60
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,240
How could I kill you?

61
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,480
Come.

62
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,520
I object to this marriage.

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
I object to this marriage.

64
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,880
We are a perfect match.

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,320
Who are you to object?

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,040
Everything

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Wait until my wedding is over.

68
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,840
This person has a different identity.

69
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm afraid...

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,080
The spy

71
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,840
from White Dragon City.

72
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,320
Now we have a huge financial loss in Bailing City.

73
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,560
As long as Yu finds the treasure map of Black Tiger Stronghold,

74
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
he will surely save me from destroying the city.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Young Master Rong is not my biological son,

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,920
I know he has always been intelligent.

77
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,280
He will complete the mission and return safely.

78
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
Report!

79
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Master Rong, Young Master Rong was assassinated.

80
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,080
and went missing.

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm a servant of the master's mansion of White Dragon City.

82
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,200
This man...

83
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,440
He's a spy sent by White Dragon City

84
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
to inquire about information.

85
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,400
You said you're a servant of the master's mansion.

86
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,120
There are four levels

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,920
four levels.

88
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Only the highest level Wind Dragon

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,600
can know the identity of a spy.

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Who are you?

91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
That's right.

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
I'm the Wind Dragon.

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,680
Unfortunately,

94
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
I made

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
I made it up.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,640
You...

97
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
Tell me, who sent you to frame me?

98
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,320
How dare you slander my husband?

99
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,840
I’m not a pushover.

100
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,840
Please spare my life.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
It’s Second Master.

102
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,440
The second head asked me to frame Gu.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
you can’t get married.

104
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
If you can't get married,

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,520
you can’t

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,320
to be the leader.

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,720
It seems that in order to oppose me

108
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
to oppose me.

109
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,040
It's not a big deal.

110
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,760
That's right.

111
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,400
I did it.

112
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
Because you don’t deserve to be the leader.

113
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,200
What’s wrong with me?

114
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
You're just a girl.

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,840
You can do anything.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
You can marry a man.

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,960
Why do you want to be the chief?

118
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
How can we

119
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,360
of Black Tiger Hideout?

120
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,600
Exactly.

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,640
Second Master is right.

122
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,880
Just because she’s a woman,

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
because she’s a woman.

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,799
What prejudice is this?

125
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
Who are you to speak?

126
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,240
I’m in charge now.

127
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,560
Do you want to rebel?

128
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Well, since the wedding has been ruined,

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
how about

130
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,040
I use the bridal chamber to make up for my husband?

131
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
It's a wedding night.

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,720
Honey, it's time to get down to business.
