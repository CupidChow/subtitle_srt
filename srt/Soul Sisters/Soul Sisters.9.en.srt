1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,600
That's what it means.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,440
You mean we can pretend to be our signboard

3
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,160
wearing women's clothes and attracting customers?

4
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,120
But there are few women in our fortress.

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,319
I won't do it.

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Me neither.

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,840
My husband is so handsome.

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
even better than a woman.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,320
Stop. Don't even think about it.

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,480
Husband, it's just an act.

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,440
Do you want our clothing business to be ruined?

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,400
I can.

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,160
Can you bear

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,440
everyone's efforts go down the drain?

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,880
I can't bear it.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,360
Honey.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,160
No.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,600
Are you going or not?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,880
Never.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
People rely on clothes, Buddha relies on gold.

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,759
A woman's wardrobe is always missing.

22
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,479
A woman's dress.

23
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,479
Please take a look.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Come and take a look at the women’s clothes.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,840
Have a look.

26
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,920
Don't miss it.

27
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Two hundred and ninety-nine copper cash for a dress.

28
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Two hundred and ninety-nine copper cash for a dress.

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Have a look.

30
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Take a look.

31
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't miss it.

32
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,360
It's the last of the year!

33
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,640
What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a beauty before?

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Strip clothes

35
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,840
There are also those who like that style.

36
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Don't worry.

37
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
Line up.

38
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,200
Hurry up.

39
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,280
Run!

40
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
Honey, do they look like

41
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
a cat barking rat?

42
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,040
doing business here

43
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
If there's no business certificate,

44
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,040
it will be confiscated.

45
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,760
How can you do business without a business certificate?

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,880
Where is our business certificate?

47
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,680
No.

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Stop!

49
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,120
Stop!

50
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Behave, or I'll teach you a lesson.

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
Look over there. See if there's anyone.

52
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
Did you see anyone coming in?

53
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
What do you think?

54
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,160
I don’t think so. Let’s go.

55
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
You scared me.

56
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,400
You’re the chief.

57
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
You don’t know?

58
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,159
I'm the head of Black Tiger Stronghold.

59
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,400
It’s cloudy.

60
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
I wanted to abandon bandits and become a businessman.

61
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
I didn't expect my business to get better

62
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I was defeated by a small business certificate.

63
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm so angry.

64
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,159
What a bandit!

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,440
What kind of goods are you selling?

66
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,400
Selling myself to Xingzhai.

67
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
I sell women's clothes.

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,880
This is the latest model I'm wearing.

69
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
What do you think?

70
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,720
Good girl.

71
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
A good girl's dress.

72
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
How many goods do you have?

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,640
I want them all.

74
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Really?

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Cloud.

76
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,280
My men are looking for me.

77
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Sister.

78
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,159
Cloud.

79
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,920
Where is he?

80
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,560
Where did he go?

81
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm here.

82
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,760
Slow down.

83
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Honey.

84
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
How are you?

85
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
I met a noble lady.

86
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
This is the one.

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,840
This is

88
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is...

89
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,440
I'm Zhao Mu, a businessman.

90
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

91
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,320
This is my handsome

92
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,080
my handsome and handsome husband, Gu Jinyu.

93
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,440
Husband.

94
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Isn't she a lady?

95
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,200
Mr. Zhao, if you have eye disease, go and treat him as soon as possible.

96
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,840
My husband is a man.

97
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,160
She dressed like this to help me sell goods.

98
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
I see.

99
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
Mr. Gu, it's hard to tell a man from a woman.

100
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,360
People might think you are sisters.

101
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
What do you mean?

102
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,039
You said my sister married

103
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,400
a sissy man?

104
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
No one treats you as a mute if you don't talk.

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
Miss Bai.

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
I don't like lying.

107
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,280
Is it wrong to tell the truth?

108
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,720
Mr. Zhao is my benefactor.

109
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
Be polite.

110
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,560
What noble lady?

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,520
If he keeps talking, I'll beat him to death.

112
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,160
He bought all our goods.

113
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,080
Is it expensive?

114
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,840
Kneel.

115
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Of course.

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,320
The goods are 100 taels.

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,560
Cash or money?

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,320
No problem. Get up.

119
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,960
The women's clothing in your fortress is cheap.

120
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,480
I want to work with you for a long time.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,480
What do you think, Miss Bai?

122
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
A long-term meal ticket.

123
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,960
But before

124
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
before signing the contract,

125
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,400
I want to see your cooperation ability first.

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
No need to check. We'll go up the mountain tomorrow.

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
Something is wrong with Mr. Zhao.

128
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
I think so too.

129
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Right?

130
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
His biggest problem is that he's too rich.

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,840
He bought all our goods.

132
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Round up?

133
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you smell money?

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,840
That's why he's more suspicious.

135
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
Miss Bai.

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,080
Miss Bai and I are like old friends.

137
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,400
It's just a small gift to express my gratitude.

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,040
It's too expensive.

139
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Forget it. I'll give it back to you.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,640
Consider this

141
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,520
for our long-term cooperation.

142
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I heard that this mountain belongs to Black Tiger Village.

143
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
Miss Bai, can you show me around?

144
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,480
Sure, I'll take you there now.

145
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,240
Let's go.
