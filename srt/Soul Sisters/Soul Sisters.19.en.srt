1
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,720
Sister.

2
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
The imperial physician is back.

3
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,600
It took a lot of effort to find out

4
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
She's fine now.

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,080
That's good.

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,880
What time is it now?

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,960
You still have the mood to plan a woman.

8
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,560
If you don't do it now,

9
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,720
when Gu Jinyu comes back with great merit,

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,840
we won't be able to be the City Governor.

11
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,120
What's the rush?

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,840
We don't have to do it.

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Gu Jinyu is going to be done soon.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
What do you mean?

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
This time he mobilized the royal physician and guards.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,039
He couldn't hide his identity.

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,080
I ordered someone to spread it.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
Tell me.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,800
With the grudges between Black Tiger Hideout and White Dragon City,

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,680
those bandits must eat him alive.

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
My identity should be exposed.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
They asked you to punish me.

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,400
Don't worry. I won't make things difficult for you.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,720
It's all my fault.

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,520
Don’t be afraid.

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,720
I’ll protect you

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,960
I’ll protect you.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't be silly.

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,920
I don’t want to leave you.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,400
Please divorce the second master.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,880
Isn’t it a divorce?

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,720
No.

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,760
What?

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
You want us to divorce?

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
Divorce?

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
Then my chance will come.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:45,960
Yes.

38
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,640
Divorce.

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,520
Divorce!

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:56,040
Divorce?

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Get up!

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
Get up!

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,840
My husband and I are deeply in love.

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,520
and love each other.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,440
But you want to break up the couple.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
You are so cruel.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
After all,

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,160
is the young master of White Dragon City.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,079
So what?

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,520
Black Tiger Stronghold and White Dragon City are sworn enemies.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,079
The fierce battle

52
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,640
are incompatible.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,400
Yes.

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,880
We are enemies.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Is that true?

56
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,960
I don't know.

57
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,360
It seems to be true.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,560
And it’s said that it’s been a long time.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,079
What rumor?

60
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,840
I want to see

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,000
Give it to me.

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
Here.

63
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,680
Look.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Here, take a look.

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,520
The grudge between Black Tiger Stronghold and White Dragon City

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
was 200 years ago.

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you still remember the grudge?

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,680
I hereby announce

69
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
the two parties have reconciled.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,959
Forever alliance is good.

71
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,079
Dismiss.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
That's it?

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
Done.

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,960
Boring.

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Settle?

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,520
They don’t deserve it.

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
Send a letter to Yu.

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,800
If we can't get the treasure map within a month,

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
our army of White Dragon City

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,880
attack the mountain and take it by force.

81
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm just worried

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
Young Master will expose his true purpose.

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,000
With her intelligence,

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,240
can she think of it?

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,240
What are you thinking about?

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,600
I was wondering why I was so lucky.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,320
I got it at random.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,800
the brave and handsome young master's husband.

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,360
Sister, I advise you

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,760
not to fall too deep.

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
It's impossible between you and her.

93
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,000
It's impossible between us.

94
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Is it possible for you and him?

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,080
Stop kidding.

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,200
It's possible for us.

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
Xiao Tian Hu.

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
I treat you as my brother.

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,520
How dare you stare at my husband?

100
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,240
Do you want to be

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
who ruins my happy marriage

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,040
who has been despised for a thousand years.

103
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
I never thought about it.

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Then I'm relieved.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Because you're not a proper couple.

106
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,400
Right.

107
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
We're just a contract couple.

108
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,080
We didn't consummate at all.

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,800
Gu Jinyu and you won't consummate.

110
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Because of her identity.

111
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Think about it.

112
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
I see.

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,040
That's it?

114
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,280
Stop it.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
I understand now.

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,080
Then I'm relieved.

117
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
After all, he's the young master.

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,320
He'll inherit the family business sooner or later.

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
And the old City Governor doesn't know about me.

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,040
I need to think about how to deal with my future father-in-law.

121
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,880
I need to think about it.

122
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,240
Let's wait for Jinyu to tell her.

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,120
Honey.

124
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm late.

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,320
Are you okay?

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,640
Am I not a lady from a noble family?

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,400
Aren't you pretending to be a fairy with garlic?

129
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,120
Shut up!

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
Stop it.

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
I mean

132
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,920
Stay out of girls' business.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
No, no, no.

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,520
Is she okay? Why is she so weird?

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,360
Gosh.

136
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,440
Sleep together

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
Listen to autumn rain

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,120
What light clothes?

139
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,320
Everyone is cold.

140
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,559
Clouds

141
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
Li.

142
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Qing Qin.

143
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
Sleep together and listen to autumn.

144
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
Sister.

145
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,680
You don't eat?

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
This is my food.

147
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
What a pity.

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,880
The crystal elbow today

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Dongpo meat

150
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,560
Roast chicken, steamed bass,

151
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
are all your favorite.

152
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
You’re not lucky.

153
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Brothers, Leader won’t eat anymore.

154
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,920
Let’s eat.

155
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Smells good.

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,760
You're drooling.

157
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,240
It's a teardrop.

158
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
Don't grab.

159
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,280
They're all mine.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,920
I want some too.

161
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm hungry.

162
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
Slow down.

163
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,800
Master is back to normal.

164
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,600
We didn’t exorcise evil in vain.

165
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,600
What if I can't become a lady?

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
and can't handle the old Castellan,

167
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,800
All of you are stumbling block.

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,960
It's none of our business.

169
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,560
Right?

170
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,560
Let's drink.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
You did this

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
to please my father?

173
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,480
What else?

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm a tacky chief.

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,200
is not good enough for a young master like you.

176
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll be disliked to death.

177
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
But I think you always look good.

178
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Really?

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Yes.

180
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,680
You lied to me again.

181
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm not lying.

182
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Eat more.

183
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
After that,

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,520
we need to think about how to deal with Zhao Mu.

185
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,480
Eat.

186
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,680
You eat too.

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,240
Master Bai.

188
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,080
Second Master Gu.

189
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,400
It's an honour to have you here.

190
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,640
Manager,

191
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
I think your shop is not bad.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,840
Are you selling it on purpose?

193
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,920
Yes.

194
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
As long as Second Master Gu wants to take over,

195
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
300 taels of silver.

196
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
Cheap. Pay the bill.

197
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,800
Here’s the money.

198
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,240
You’re so bold.

199
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,600
You know nothing.

200
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,320
We plan to take over a dozen shops.

201
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,840
Shut up!

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,560
It's too humid here.

203
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,400
Ordinary people have been troubled by rheumatism for a long time.

204
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,960
If we create a herbal fragrance and medicinal wine,

205
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,600
herbal baths as a long health industry,

206
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
must have a great business opportunity.

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,600
How can we disclose such a trade secret to the public?

208
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,280
If someone takes the lead,

209
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,680
it’s all over.

210
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
You’re wise. I’m sorry.

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
Come with me to contact the bank.

212
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Buy the shop as soon as possible.

213
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
Let's go.

214
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go. Let's go.

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,320
This time,

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
I can finally defeat him

217
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,840
before I kill Gu Jinyu.

218
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,560
Eavesdropping?

219
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,160
It's fair and square.

220
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,120
Cut the crap

221
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,720
Pay me all the cash in the account

222
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,920
and cut the money off

223
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
The cash in the account

224
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,080
was in Gu Jinyu's hands last time

225
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
The bank belongs to my sister.

226
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
and has been entrusted to me.

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,520
I'll take care of the company for now.

228
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Hurry.

229
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Don't miss the chance.

230
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,760
Yes.

231
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,880
As you ordered,

232
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,640
in front of Gu Jinyu.

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,520
in front of Gu Jinyu.

234
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,880
Good.

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,360
Great.

236
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,800
Gu Jinyu.

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,800
You're doomed.

238
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,680
It's just that

239
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,240
there's not much cash on the bank account.

240
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,680
What are you afraid of?

241
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,880
As long as we don't squeeze a lot of cash,

242
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,320
it will be a secret.

243
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,720
Zhao Mu!

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Zhao Mu, come out!

245
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Zhao Mu, come out!

246
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Zhao Mu.

247
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,640
Is the bank running out of money?

248
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
Where did the rumor come from?

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Listen to me.

250
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,760
Listen to me.

251
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,840
Rumor has it out.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,520
You still won't admit it?

253
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,240
Where did you get the money for the shop?

254
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,800
Pay me back!

255
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,200
Or you'll go to jail for bankruptcy.

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,440
Pay me back!

257
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
Sir.

258
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,520
Sir.
