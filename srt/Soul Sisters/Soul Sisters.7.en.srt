1
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,920
Tell him

2
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,840
the reason why Black Tiger Hideout is established in Jianghu

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,200
because of friendship.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,880
He's a merchant. He only cares about profit.

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,920
He’s not a merchant. How can he give up?

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
That’s what she said.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,440
She has her reasons.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Can love feed her?

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
Without a perfect system,

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,039
Black Tiger Hideout will become more poor and weak.

11
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,360
We can't survive in the future.

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
It's only a matter of time before it's destroyed.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Tell him that I'm too naive.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Isn't it too much

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,480
Isn't that too much?

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,440
Tell her

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm doing this for her sake.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
What do you mean?

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,440
and Black Tiger Hideout.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,000
Why did you say that?

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,760
Am I being harsh?

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,320
This is to make her realize the reality.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,080
Does she understand?

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,400
Enough.

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
You two are so close.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,080
Do you have to torture me to pass the message?

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,400
At worst, we can divorce.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,039
I'll kick you out.

29
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,400
You'll be alone then.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,560
You can go wherever you want.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,680
Do whatever you want.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,120
No one will care about you anymore.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,560
or argue with you.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,400
Will you be happy? Will you...

35
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,560
You... You'd better take care of yourself.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
Let's divorce.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,160
I'd love to.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Why do I feel so happy

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
sounds good.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,680
Why don't we eat first?

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
It's indeed unreasonable to affect our dinner.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,760
Reason again.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,600
Let's start.

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
Since you're right,

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,360
your status and status

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,120
it’s only right to give it to me.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,760
You’re enjoying the benefits of the rules.

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,920
According to the morality,

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,200
it's not your turn.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
They started again.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
Attention everyone

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,600
If they don't get along in the house, the armies will be exhausted.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,000
If they don't make up,

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,560
our family will break up.

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,000
Everyone, assemble!

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
to hold a knock-off meeting.

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Gather up for the emergency meeting.

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
Are you done?

59
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,480
We have a meeting every day.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,360
So fast

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,240
Wait.

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,480
Master, what are you doing?

63
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
He’s preparing his emotions.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
He has a family.

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,840
He knows nothing except being a bandit.

66
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,760
If you kick him out now,

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,920
he'll die.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
You're such a good actor.

69
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a pity to be a bandit.

70
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,120
I’d rather go to the brothel.

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
to be a clown.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,480
I hate it.

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Leader, let an outsider like Gu Jinyu...

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Outsiders?

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,600
to punish our own brothers.

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
and transformation.

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,960
Instead of letting this person talk nonsense,

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
why don't you follow me?

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,640
Go on.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Robbery! Robbery!

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,160
Yes, that's right.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,200
It's not fair

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,720
it's not fair to be kicked out.

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
Yeah, maybe we’ll be the next one to leave.

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,720
We might as well follow the Second Master.

86
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
They should leave.

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Why don’t we let the second head be the leader?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Make way.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,240
These pearl powder are for tomorrow.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Don't get wet.

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
Let's go.

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
What should we do now?

93
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
What a pity.

94
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,960
Master’s efforts were ruined.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,800
If that woman can keep quiet,

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,080
there might be room to turn around.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,920
What a pity. It's hard.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,360
Make way.

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Be quiet.

100
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Actually, I don’t want to be the leader.

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
But...

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,080
Well...

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,560
The situation is greater than others.

104
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,240
I...

105
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
I'll try my best.

106
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
Look.

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,680
Second Master's fox tail is revealed again.

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
That’s too long.

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,360
I'm sleepy.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,000
This family will break up without me.

111
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,640
What do you mean?

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,720
Are you okay?

113
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm fine.

114
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
I have something to tell you.

115
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
You go first.

116
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,760
Everything should be step by step.

117
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,040
You can't be quick.

118
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
I was too hasty before.

119
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,440
I know you did it

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
for the good of our village.

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,480
maybe we can think of a way to compromise.

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,919
We can set rules

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,440
and the friendship between you and your brothers.

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,400
If I could figure it out sooner,

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,040
we wouldn't have been in this mess.

126
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,360
You even went to all lengths to ask me out.

127
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Ready?

128
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
I thought you asked me to come here.

129
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,480
It was you.

130
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,240
Just take a step back.

131
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
I have to do it myself.

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,640
And what I'm doing is what everyone wants.

133
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Surprise?

134
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,480
The tricks behind you

135
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
has been discovered by us.

136
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Swap it with cheap pearl powder.

137
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,160
and incited them to make trouble.

138
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,880
In the end, he used the conflict between us

139
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,040
to get promoted.

140
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,280
Second Master, what a big game!

141
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Nonsense!

142
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,640
You see, I’m popular in the Fortress.

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,440
So you framed me

144
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
and eliminate dissidents, right?

145
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,080
Think about it.

146
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
You didn't miss a drop of water.

147
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,840
No.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,200
Did they really catch something?
