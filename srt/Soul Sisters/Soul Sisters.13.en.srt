1
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Be careful.

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Tiger Shou!

3
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,000
Xiao Tian Hu, how are you?

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,480
Run!

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,520
Fire!

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,240
Put out the fire!

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
Be careful.

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,720
Be careful.

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,840
He's badly injured.

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
Let's go find the doctor.

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,480
Hurry.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:23,840
Let's go.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,960
I've worked hard for many days.

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,720
It's like cutting off the way of Black Tiger Stronghold.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,039
Who could

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,920
did such a crazy thing?

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,039
It's so hateful.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
That's right.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
No.

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,520
Why are you looking at me?

21
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,760
I didn't do it this time.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
If it wasn't you,

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,360
after the explosion,

24
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,000
everyone came to put out the fire.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Where are you?

26
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,640
I'm really wronged.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,440
I think you won't cry until you see the coffin.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,600
I found these from your room.

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
What else do you have to explain?

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,600
In the future, you'll be able to grow and become stronger.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,720
and become the national champion.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,120
Since you're so cruel,

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800
don't blame me for being unjust.

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
Who's outside?

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
How is that possible?

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
You're slandering me!

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Help!

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Arrest him!

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,600
I did my best for the fortress.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,320
I bled for the fortress.

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,560
You can't do this to me.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,920
Kick Wang Hu out of the fortress.

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
It has nothing to do with Black Tiger Hideout.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,760
Let's go.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
I didn't do it.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,680
It was you.

47
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's go.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,960
It's not easy to sell.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
but it's broken again.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,120
Dear, what should we do?

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,160
There's always a way.

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
Don’t worry. There will be a solution.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Madam. Madam.

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,760
The Counsellor is awake.

55
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,200
You are going to die.

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,760
Why are you taking medicine?

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
I'll drink less.

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,560
we'll have one more bowl of rice.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
It's just a scratch.

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,080
You'll be fine after some rest.

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Hush.

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,320
Don't lie to me.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,800
I know my own body.

64
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,760
I feel a stone on my chest.

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,800
I can't breathe.

66
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
I don't think I'll live long.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,640
Nonsense!

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,920
Leader.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,440
Considering your contribution yesterday,

70
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,560
I asked the kitchen to prepare some food for you.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
These are all your favourites.

72
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,960
You're not feeling well now.

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,600
It's hard to digest these food.

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,200
Not yet.

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
Then why did you bring it here?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
We've been through thick and thin together.

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,160
We should share happiness.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,840
Look at us.

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,680
I kind of feel a little involved.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Are you here to piss me off?

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,240
Don't be so pessimistic.

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,840
It's not too late to eat after you recover.

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Honey, try this.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,320
The heat is not bad today.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
Honey, try this.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
It melts in your mouth.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
It's soft and sweet.

88
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,560
I can't eat. I'll just drink some water.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,760
You must be thirsty.

90
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,920
Let me feed you some water.

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,600
Do you have any humanity?

92
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
It's work injury.

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm thirsty too.

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
I want you to feed me.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,840
Okay.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
I don't want my hands.

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,080
I want it.

98
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
You!

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,280
You've gone too far.

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
You're really clever.

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
Otherwise, the blood stasis can't be removed.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
It's hard to heal.

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,080
What a beggar!

104
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,320
You want to eat and drink with a broken knife?

105
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,040
Stop pretending to be a hero.

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,280
Where is this place?

107
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
Get out of here.

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
Isn't this the second head of Black Tiger Stronghold?

109
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
Why are you in such a state?

110
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,240
Did he get kicked out by the fortress?

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,720
30 years in Hedong and 30 years in Hexi.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Wait for me to rise again.

113
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,200
I guess I was right.

114
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,600
Since they are heartless,

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
why don't you follow me?

116
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
I'll take you to a good place

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,200
to avenge your death.

118
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
Thank you for taking me in.

119
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm willing to serve you.

120
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
Please get up.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
It's been a long time

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,760
Please.

123
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,400
What should we do?

124
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
Cheer up!

125
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,760
We've been through a lot.

126
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
This is nothing.

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
This is all we have left

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
That's all we have left.

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
The granary was also in trouble.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,160
It's all barbecue.

131
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Nothing.

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
It's my turn.

133
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
No movement.

134
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,800
It's not suitable.

135
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,040
So,

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,360
the fortress is back to the time

137
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
I’m poor now.

138
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
It's not as good as before.

139
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,360
We're all good now.

140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,440
We don't even dare to kill pigs.

141
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,920
let alone robbery.

142
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
What should we do?

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,080
Dear.

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,800
Please save Black Tiger Stronghold.

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Fortunately, someone in Black Tiger Hideout has skills.

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
and has connections.

147
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Now,

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
can only turn the situation around

149
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
to change the situation.

150
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
By the way,

151
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,200
do you have any special holidays or events recently?

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Is there?

153
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,160
It's the 250th anniversary of Heihu Stronghold's establishment.

154
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
Got it.

155
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
Temple fair.

156
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Got it. That's it.

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,760
Guys.

158
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
Go down the mountain for business.
