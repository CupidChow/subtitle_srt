1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,440
It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell.

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,800
It's hard to solve the urgent problem.

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,240
Low cost but easy to copy, hard to be climate.

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,320
The threshold are too high. It's not worth it.

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
Hubby, why do you have the same problem again?

6
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,680
Don't think too much.

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,680
Let everything go smoothly.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,080
Maybe good things will come to you.

9
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,680
What do you think?

10
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah, sharpening knives won't affect cutting.

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
It tastes good.

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,960
Let's go over there.

13
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,039
I'm sorry if I give up.

14
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,520
I have the word "Tiger".

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,759
Wait for me.

16
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,440
Young lady.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
Your accuracy is not good either.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,920
Are you here to give me money?

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
Shut up!

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,760
Honey.

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
I want...

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Relax your shoulders.

23
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Look ahead.

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Focus on your hands.

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,240
I hit my ears.

26
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
It's pretty.

27
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
It's my turn.

28
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
Take it closer.

29
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,880
Take it closer.

30
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,600
Okay.

31
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,280
Closer.

32
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,279
Give it to me.

33
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,160
Okay.

34
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,520
Brother Gu.

35
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
Brother Gu.

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,520
Who are they?

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
There is lion dance.

38
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Wait.

39
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Are you happy?

40
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,280
I think we should

41
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,840
should move freely.

42
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,200
I agree with you.

43
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
You've been with us all day.

44
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,960
You must be bored.

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,560
Why don't you play alone?

46
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,040
No, I think it's fun.

47
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,800
It's hot and spinning the plate.

48
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
Since we all have the energy,

49
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
let's play hide-and-seek.

50
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
Hide.

51
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,320
and see when we can find you.

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
Good idea, Gu.

53
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm good at playing hide-and-seek.

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
You can't beat me.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
Let's get started.

56
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Let's go. Let's go.

57
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,360
In the past,

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,480
my father would bring me to the temple fair to see lion dance.

59
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,160
He said he would give me a gift if I win the lottery.

60
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,280
But there was no exception.

61
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,840
They all failed.

62
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,040
Now there's no chance to fulfill my dream.

63
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
Stay here.

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Wait for me.

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,840
Okay.

66
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay.

67
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay.

68
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Dear.

69
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,600
White clouds, happy birthday.

70
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Let me realize

71
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,520
will come true.

72
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
How did you know it's my birthday?

73
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,000
As long as you want it, it's not hard to know.

74
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,080
Thank you

75
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
for spending a happy birthday with me.

76
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,520
Don't you know what this is?

77
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
Let me hold it for you.

78
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,720
Thank you.

79
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
This is...

80
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,799
Open it.

81
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,040
You made my world colorful.

82
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,960
So I want to draw this memory

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
as your birthday gift.

84
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,600
Why don't you draw yourself in it?

85
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,000
God bless me.

86
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I hope my love and I can be together forever.

87
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
You have a lover?

88
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Who is it?

89
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm here.

90
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,520
I told you you couldn't find me.

91
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,040
I hid it until the end.

92
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
You're amazing.

93
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,480
If you win, I'm leaving.

94
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,480
Take it.
