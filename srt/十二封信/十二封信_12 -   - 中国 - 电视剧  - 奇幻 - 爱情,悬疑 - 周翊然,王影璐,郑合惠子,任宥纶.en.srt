Come back quickly.

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,559
Got it.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
I'll return as soon as I finish here.

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,599

Dad,

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,584
- what's on your mind now?
- It can't.

23
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:14,439
It's late. That place is closed.

24

25
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,439
listen to me.

successfully bid for

the Shiqiao foothills plot.

Haven't I made myself clear?

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
It's too risky.

71
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
I can't do it.

72

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,080
At the wharf.

98
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,599

00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,199

101
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,720
Why is he back?

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,079
I don't know either.

103
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,679
But Tang,

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,879
you need to be extra careful these days.

105
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,079
Don't let him know you're living here.

106
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,159
I'll be careful.

107
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,039
Your hands are dirty.

108
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680

109
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520

112

115
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll eat then.

again tonight.

117

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,839
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

119

Tang,

120
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,279
do you think that mailbox

121
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,279
is malfunctioning?

122
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,240
It can't be.

123
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,959
Didn't our last letter
get sent out properly?

124

Here's the plan.

125
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,879
I'll keep track of time.

126
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,439
Around 11 PM tonight,

127
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,919
I'll wait for you
at the bookstore mailbox.

128
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
I'll go there right after class.

129
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,519
Okay.

130
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519

The body's been drowned for ten days.

137
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
He wasn't killed here.

138
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,639
The water carried the body down

139
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,272

was the evening of November 8th.

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
Was he related to my mom's death?

172

Did he cause it?

since then.

181

the case my mom
was involved in back in 1991,

185
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:25,840
can I see the case files?

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
It'll need a lot of paperwork.

187
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:30,159
What'd you like to know?

188
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,960

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,919
Are you blind?

194
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,599
Tang?

195
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,399
Tang.

196
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
Tang,

197
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
I thought

198
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,639
we'd never meet again in this lifetime.

199
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,200
All these years,

200
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,600
I've been looking for you.

201
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,320
I needed to see you,

202
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,479
alive or dead.

203
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,200
A wretched life
beats an honorable death.

204
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,799
I have a daughter after all.

205
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,919
You've been doing well these years.

206
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,279
This car isn't cheap.

207
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,679
I never imagined

208
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,720
I'd ever ride in such a nice car.

209
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,840
My illnesses might finally be cured.

210
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Where have you been?

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,399
I've been hiding

212
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
like a rat.

213
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,639
I have a question

214
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,080
for you.

215
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,879
Where's

216
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
my mom?

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,919
Where's my mom?

218
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,480
It happened a long time ago.

219
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,480
What's the point of knowing now?

220
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,519
Did you kill her?

221
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,039
That's what you
told the police back then, right?

222
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
Did it work?

223
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,799
Without a body,

224
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,879
it didn't work at all.

225
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,799
So it was you.

226
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
I was one step too late then,

227
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,920
letting you live these extra years.

228
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,799
You never believed

229
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,240
your mom ran off with someone, did you?

230
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,199
Back then,

231
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,800
I believed you.

232
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
I still believe what you're saying now.

233
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,480
What happened

234
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,960
that day?

235
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,599
Your mom was acting strange that day.

236
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
So I followed her all the way.

237
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,799
At Shiqiao,

238
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,480
I caught her.

239
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,039
I found two boat tickets on her.

240
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,920
She was planning
to run away with some man.

241
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,799
I told her,

242
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,680
"Whoever it is,"

243
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,039
"just stay with me."

244
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,680
"And I'll let it go."

245
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,960
But she refused.

246
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,559
I got on my knees and begged.

247
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,680
Still she refused.

248
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,119
That woman was heartless.

249
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,160
She would rather die
than go home with me.

250
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,519
So I kept choking her

251
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,680
until she stopped breathing.

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And she still refused.

253
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,000
She was eager to run away with a man.

254
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,640
She was desperate to leave our family.

255
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,920
She wasn't running away.

256
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,079
The second ticket was for me.

257
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,680
She waited at Shiqiao for me.

258
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,160
She wasn't running away!

259
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,279
She was waiting for me!

260
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,559
So you two planned to run together.

261
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,760
You've kept

262
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,519
the secret buried for decades,
haven't you?

263
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Truly Wu Fengying's daughter.

264
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,839
Both master schemers.

265
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,279
You two ruined my life!

266
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,359
Hiding the truth all these years,

267
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,960
you're finally confessing now.

268
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
Tang,

269
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
do you know
why I dare tell you this now?

270
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,240
Go report me now.

271
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,079
Let the police arrest me.

272
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,440
The court won't sentence me to death.

273
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,799
I'm old

274
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
and sick.

275
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,199
Prison means

276
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,839
free healthcare

277
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,640
and free meals.

278
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
It'll be so much better

279
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,200
than starving out here.

280
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,679
Tang,

281
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,440
if you can't swallow the anger,

282
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,640
I will turn myself in now.

283
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,559
"Can't swallow"?

284
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,960
To you,

285
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,800
can all the things

286
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,359
and the lives

287
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,880
be "swallowed"?

288
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,559
We're old now.

289
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,039
Anything can be let go of.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
Right.

291
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,119
We're old now.

292
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
It's enough.

293
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,880
Yes.

294
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,800
It's enough.

295
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,440
Buckle your seatbelt.

296
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,119
Where are you taking me?

297
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,440
To give you a ride.

298
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,568
Why didn't Tang Yixun
pick you up tonight?

299
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,400
He's working at the docks.

300
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
It's past 11 already.

301
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,559
Let me walk you home.

302
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,079
No need.

303
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,359
We'll meet at the bookstore.

304
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,039
Which college will Wang Manyu go to?

305
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,079
I'll ask about it later.

306
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,920
Do you know what Wang Manyu likes?

307
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,599
Are you okay?

308
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,359
How could you ride like that?

309
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,440
You crashed into me.

310
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,079
Unreasonable!

311
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,960
I crashed into you?

312
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,000
Did I touch you?

313
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,039
Where were you going?

314
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,039
You should've gone

315
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,799
this way.

316
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,680
You insulted me.

317
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,399
You're unreasonable.

318
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,480
You insulted me.

319
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,440
(You don't have a mom now.)

320
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,839
(A woman like her)

321
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,839
isn't worthy to be your mom.

322
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Tang,

323
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
from now on, it'll be

324
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,039
(only us in this family.)

325
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,440
You hit me and insulted me.

326
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,279
Where are you going?

327
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Ye Haitang!

328
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,240
Shen Cheng, you can't mail that letter.

329
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,080
Haven't you thought?

330
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:24,879
If...

331
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,880
If we stop all this,

332
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,480
then everything afterward

333
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,559
could change completely.

334
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,200
Your mom might miss your dad.

335
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,319
And you might never be born.

336
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,080
I have.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
Very seriously.

338
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,960
But recently,

339
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,720
the more I learn about the past

340
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,200
and the more I understand them both,

341
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,039
the more unsettled I feel.

342
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,720
I've made up my mind.

343
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,480
I can't accept

344
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,759
my mom ending her life

345
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,880
in that way.

346
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
None of this

347
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,920
should require sacrificing you.

348
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,519
You have a whole life ahead.

349
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,559
If you were me,

350
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,000
what would you do?

351
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,519
Neither of us is a hero.

352
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,039
We're both ordinary people.

353
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,880
Being ordinary means

354
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,200
we can't do many things.

355
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,519
Without that mailbox,

356
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,759
I'd suggest we each go home,

357
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,119
let go of the past,

358
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,119
and move on with our own lives.

359
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,720
But there's no choice.

360
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,359
That mailbox

361
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,440
appeared right before us.

362
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,000
We can save two young people

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,559
from their suffering.

364
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,519
I know this might devastate you.

365
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,759
If everything changes,

366
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,200
you'll lose a father who loves you.

367
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,920
You might end up

368
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,160
alone in this world.

369
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,839
And I might never have existed.

370
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,839
We'll both lose so much.

371
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,799
But we'll still save them.

372
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,359
No.

373
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,520
No, Shen Cheng.

374
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,559
We are different.

375
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,000
You have your dad.

376
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,720
You still have family in this world.

377
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,599
If everything changes,

378
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
my dad won't have me.

379
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,680
I won't have a family.

380
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,599
No one in this world will remember me.

381
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,160
How come nobody remembers you?

382
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,480
I'll remember you.

383
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,920
I'll remember all of this.

384
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
I'll remember.

385
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,759
You won't remember me.

386
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:51,640
That's not true.

387
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:52,799
That's not true.

388
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,720
There's another way.

389
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,559
There must be.

390
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,759
We just haven't thought of it.

391
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,119
There might be another way,

392
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,079
but we're out of time.

393
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,720
My passport.

394
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
No, we'll figure it out.

395
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:01,919
Let's think again.

396
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,039
We can think of a way.

397
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,200
We're running out of time.

398
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,240
No.

399
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,280
Keep up.

400
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,359
The construction guys are here.

401
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,559
Look, it's them, right?

402
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
Yes.

403
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,199
Where are you going?

404
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,399
Where are you going?

405
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,519
I need to take a look.

406
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,680
What if they demolish it?

407
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
Be quiet.

408
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,279
I know their operation too well.

409
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,079
They won't make big moves at night.

410
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,079
They're just setting up.

411
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,400
Before dawn breaks,

412
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,279
I'll move the mailbox.

413
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,039
Cut the crap.

414
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,400
How will they mail letters then?

415
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,400
After they finish demolishing,

416
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,759
I'll put it back.

417
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,039
The mailbox matters the most.

418
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,119
With the mailbox, they can mail letters.

419
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,880
I'll guard it.

420
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,119
Your plan won't work.

421
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:51,880
I'll talk to them.

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,279
Will they listen to you?

423
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,119
Worth a try.

424
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,400
Don't get yourself...

425
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,839
Shen Cheng texted me.

426
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,160
Quick. Help me up.

427
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,279
On the night of November 30,

428
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,720
you and Tang Yixun must not
go to the foothills.

429
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,359
Or Tang Yixun will kill someone.

430
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,559
Then you'll never see each other again.

431
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,680
This might be our final correspondence.

432
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,880
But please believe,

433
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,440
all hardships will pass,

434
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,079
and you'll have a bright future ahead.

435
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,680
May you overcome adversity

436
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
and reach the stars.

437
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,719
Yu Nian and Shen Cheng.

438
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,559
What does this mean?

439
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,480
Killing someone? Why?

440
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,439
No idea.

441
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,519
Quan,

442
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,720
we can't make it back in time.

443
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,759
Time's running out.

444
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,279
We need you to send this final letter.

445
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,000
Do it before they remove

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,160
the mailbox.

447
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,000
Please.

448
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,039
Send the letter.

449
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:36,599
Hurry.

450
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,439
Come on.

451
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,959
Hurry.

452
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
It's 11:40 now.

453
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,560
Where's the pen?

454
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,279
Who took my pen?

455
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,559
It's making this worse.

456
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
I'll buy one.

457
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,839
Where will you find one at night?

458
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,599
Don't waste time.

459
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,799
It's already 11:40.

460
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,039
I don't have a pen.

461
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,280
You have one?

462
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,199
Here.

463
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,799
What pen is this?

464
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:02,640
Eyebrow pencil.

465
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,720
How do I write with this?

466
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,680
Stop complaining.

467
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,799
It'll work.

468
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,560
Time's limited.

469
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Oh my god!

470
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,400
Stop that disgusting act.

471
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:24,839
What did you do?

472
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,880
How do we write like this?

473
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,039
I didn't mean to.

474
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:27,920
You aren't helping!

475
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,839
How do I fix this?

476
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,400
Too late now. What now?

477
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,839
Enough!

478
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,079
Stop yelling.

479
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,720
There's some space left. I'll write.

480
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,279
Look at you.

481
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,359
Such an important matter,
and we're late.

482
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,319
Why'd you stop?

483
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,839
There's not enough space.

484
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,799
Write the crucial parts.

485
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,320
About the murder.

486
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
The murder.

487
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,200
If you can't send this letter,

488
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,240
you'll regret it.

489
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:54,880
How do you feel?

490
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,039
I can manage. No problem.

491
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:56,680
He's young.

492
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,240
Yeah, he is.

493
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,080
Right.

494
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,799
What is the time now?

495
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,680
11:45.

496
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,759
It's late. Go rest.

497
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,400
You should rest too.

498
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,359
Bye.

499
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:05,880
Young man,

500
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,000
next time, shop with me.

501
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Right.

502
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,640
No problem. Bye.

503
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,160
(Mom,)

504
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,000
why do you only
wear this same hairpin every day?

505
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,079
What? Doesn't it look nice?

506
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,640
It does look nice,

507
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,759
but do you only have this one?

508
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,799
Then when you grow up,

509
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,759
buy Mom new hairpins, okay?

510
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:53,839
Okay.

511
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,200
I'll buy you a hundred hairpins.

512
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,000
A hundred hairpins?

513
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,599
I can't wear them all.

514
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:12,700
(Sunshine Bookstore)

515
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,160
Only five minutes left.

516
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,680
You go first. Don't mind me.

517
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,079
We'll make it. We will.

518
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,800
What's going on?

519
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,079
Why's it blocked?

520
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:40,759
No idea.

521
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,920
Relax, that's my buddy.

522
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,119
Let's go.

523
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,159
Bro.

524
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,079
Zhang Quan, what are you doing?

525
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,680
Construction inside. No entry.

526
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,279
Construction?

527
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,200
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,960
Five minutes, okay?

529
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,680
No.

530
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,520
There are rules.

531
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,519
Don't touch her.

532
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,200
She's pregnant.

533
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,400
She still can't pass.

534
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,240
Zhang Quan, stop.

535
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,559
You want to get fired?

536
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,559
Stop.

537
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,759
Five minutes. I'll be quick.

538
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:02,480
No way.

539
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,519
I have urgent business.

540
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,480
One minute. Please.

541
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,680
Now get lost.

542
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,720
Why did you kick him?

543
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,599
Get lost.

544
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,199
I respect you as my superior.

545
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,039
My mom taught me

546
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,519
to keep peace when away from home.

547
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,840
You can't do this.

548
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:15,799
Your mom taught you?

549
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,559
Didn't your mom tell you I'm your dad?

550
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm telling you.

551
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,440
Get out of here now!

552
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Captain's getting beaten!

553
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,960
Miaomiao!

554
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,000
Help hold him down.

555
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
Miaomiao!

556
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,720
Beat him!

557
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,039
Leave this to me.

558
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,599
Quan.

559
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,079
Go mail the letter, Miaomiao.

560
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,279
Quan, hang in there.

561
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,959
Mail the letter.

562
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,400
Hang in there.

563
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,759
Hold him down.

564
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,000
Get that letter mailed!

565
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:33,312
(Avoid the foothills and killing
on November 30th.)

566
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,239
Don't kill anyone?

567
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,959
Tang Yixun.

568
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,440
Isn't Ye Haitang here?

569
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Isn't she with you?

570
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,280
Oh no.

571
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,719
We just finished tutoring,

572
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,480
and when we left,

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,000
she said she was coming to find you.

574
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,119
But we hadn't walked far

575
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,400
when a motorcycle crashed.

576
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,000
Then Ye Haitang chased after it.

577
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,039
Who was on it?

578
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,199
Not sure. It was dark.

579
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,360
But that man was scary.

580
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,559
Ye Haitang knows him.

581
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,280
It's midnight.

582
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
Where could she be?

583
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,439
What's today's date?

584
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,679
Today? November 30th.

585
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,519
Call the police.

586
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,280
Let them go to the foothills.

587
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,280
What are you saying?

588
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,800
Stop it.

589
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Just call the police.

590
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,880
Let them go to the foothills.

591
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,919
Okay.

592
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,959
Li.

593
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,079
It's too windy.

594
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,039
I can't set sail.

595
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:35,919
Li,

596
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,079
this thing can't wait.

597
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,200
Handle it now.

598
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,239
I won't risk my life for you.

599
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,239
I'll double

600
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,760
the promised price.

601
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,760
Will that work?

602
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,880
You'd better keep this buried.

603
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,639
Don't you drag me into this.

604
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:01,919
Don't worry.

605
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
If something happens,

606
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,000
I'll be the first to die.

607
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600

608
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Who's she?

609
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:20,559
What's in the sack?

610
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,680
What are you doing?

611
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
What are you doing here?

612
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,800
What's in the sack?

613
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,039
Tell me.

614
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:26,880
What's in the sack?

615
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,000
What's in the sack?

616
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,079
None of your business!

617
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,200
My mom's hairpin.

618
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,360
What do you mean?

619
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,960
This is my mom's hairpin!

620
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,719
What's in the sack?

621
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,760
Your mom ran off
with another man ten years ago!

622
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,480
Your mom abandoned us!

623
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,960
What's in the sack?

624
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,719
So desperate to know what's in the sack?

625
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,599
Fine, I'll show you what's inside.

626

629
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,280
for the agreed price,

630
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
add another one.

631
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,159

641
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:27,919
