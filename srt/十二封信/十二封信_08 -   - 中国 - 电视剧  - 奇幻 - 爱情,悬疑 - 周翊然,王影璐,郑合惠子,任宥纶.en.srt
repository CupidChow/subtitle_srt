1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,320
Take care.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,160
Thank you, sir.

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,199
Xun.

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,559
Does the light inside the crystal ball

5
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,559
resemble aurora?

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,199
So beautiful.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,280
Aurora?

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,719
Is this what aurora looks like?

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,039
I don't know.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,200
Never seen it either.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,159
But it looks like
the one on the postcards.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,759
So colorful.

13
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,439
It's beautiful.

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,920
Whatever it is,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,719
it's pretty.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,840
(Meiwan Town General Store)
What do you want to do?

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,960
I'll buy it for you.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,520
It must be expensive.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,119
Don't.

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,399
It's okay. I can afford it now.

21
00:00:58,839 --> 00:00:59,679
Don't.

22
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,600
Why waste your money on this?

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
You like it.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
I'll buy it for you.

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:05,999
Don't worry.

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Listen.

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,600
Don't buy it today.

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,280
You can gift it to me on my birthday.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,240
Okay?

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,560
But I can buy it now.

31
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,640
Gift it to me on my birthday
is more meaningful.

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,480
Right?

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,159
Gift it to me on my birthday.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,599
Alright?

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,480
Alright.

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,519
It's settled then.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,079
On your birthday,

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,079
I'll buy one for you.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,480
No doubt.

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
Okay.

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,359
When is your birthday?

42
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,719
You've never mentioned it.

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,159
I don't remember my birthday.

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,359
I knew the day I arrived

45
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,719
at the welfare house,

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
but I forgot it too.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
You've never celebrated a birthday?

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,159
What for? I'm not a child anymore.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll gift it to you

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,359
for your birthday this year.

51
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,920
But it's not the only one gift.

52
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,400
If you like or want

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
anything else,

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
just tell me.

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll get it for you.

56
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,320
Alright.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's go.

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,039
Okay.

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
Tang?

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,840
What is this?

61
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Xun.

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,199
I'll celebrate
your birthday today, okay?

63
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,599
Okay.

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,159
But why today?

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,199
Birthday could be your birthdate,

66
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,319
or any happy day.

67
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,560
In a year,

68
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,479
you need one day for this ritual.

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
Old folks always say,

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
"It's always better do it today."

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
Why not

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,719
make it today, November 9th?

73
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,439
Do you agree?

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
I do.

75
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Then today is

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,520
the birthday you gave me,

77
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
and also

78
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,216
my first birthday celebration.

79
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,680
So it's settled.

80
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll be with you

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,040
on your birthday every year.

82
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
It's too late today.

83
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,240
Birthday cakes were sold out.

84
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,120
I only found this rice cake.

85
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,759
But next year,

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll definitely get you

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,439
a huge birthday cake,

88
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,520
covered with candles.

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,879
Okay?

90
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
Make three wishes.

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Blow out the candles.

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
I wish Ye Haitang

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,840
gets into her ideal university.

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
I wish Ye Haitang

95
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,360
stays healthy and strong.

96
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
I wish Ye Haitang

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
lives well

98
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,279
in this life.

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,759
I wish Tang Yixun a happy birthday.

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,160
May he be happy every single day.

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Blow out the candles.

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,640
Okay.

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
Let's do it together.

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,439
Three, two, one.

105
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,936

00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:20,075

(The spring is bright, but gone forever)

107
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:28,768
(1991)

108
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,519
Xun.

109
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,919
Tang.

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Listen to me.

111
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,360
You go home first

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
and change your clothes.

113
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,360
You didn't come here

114
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,120
and knew nothing about this.

115
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,839
I didn't come here?

116
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,159
What's your plan?

117
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,199
Just do as I said.

118
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,759
No plan.

119
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,639
Just go back, okay?

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
What's your plan?

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Go back.

122
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
- Go back.
- No!

123
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,480
Go back.

124
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,480
Go back!

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,320
No!

127
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,040
I won't go. Let's face it together.

128
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,600
Let's face it together.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,199
- Let's face it together.
- Tang.

130
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
They tried to kill us.

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,079
Ye Haitang! Ye Haitang!

132
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,519
Listen to me! Please listen!

133
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,319
You go back. Please go back.

134
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,199
No.

135
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,560
Let's face it together.

136
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,240
They tried to kill us.

137
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,439
There is no "us".

138
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,720
Only me.

139
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,480
You have a bright future.

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,680
You need to go to college.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,519
What about you?

142
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,159
Y...

143
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
You...

144
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,479
live well for me.

145
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,159
You live well for me.

146
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:52,839
No!

147
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,679
No!

148
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
No!

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
No!

Officer.

153
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,599
I committed a crime.

154
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,599
I killed someone.

155
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,279
Get down. Hands up!

156
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,119
Please cooperate.

157
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,839
Where did it happen?

158
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,799
Half-hill.

159
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,919
Xun!

160
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
Ye Haitang!

161
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,800
What are you doing here?

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,839
What are you doing?

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
What are you doing? Answer me!

164
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Officer.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
I was there.

166
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,600
They tried to kill us.

167
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,360
Leave!

168
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,040
Calm down.

169
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,480
Leave!

170
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
- Calm down.
- Leave!

171
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,639
They tried to kill us.

172
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,199
Leave!

173
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,759
Calm down.

174
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,599
Leave!

Officer.

176
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,920
I was there. They tried to kill us.

177
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,040
I can testify.

178
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,360
Take them to interrogation.

179
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,040
They tried to kill us.

180
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,759
They tried to kill us!

181
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,599
Leave!

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
I did everything.

183
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,919
She is innocent!

184
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,919

190
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,559
Alright.

191
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,399
Understood.

192
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,320
He refused to see you.

193

I'm strong now.

579
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,680
Teng has grown up!

580
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,160
Dad, pull harder!

581
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,199
Got it.

582
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,240
If buying a boat, get a big one!

583
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,200
Who'll sail it?

584
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,759
I can learn.

585
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,799
He learns to sail it.

586
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,599
And you learn English, Xun.

587
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,480
We'll do export business,

588
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,960
negotiate with foreigners,

589
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,640
and earn US dollars.

590
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,039
- US dollars!
- US dollars!

591
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,079
Then Cha can finally marry

592
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,119
Xin.

593
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
By then,

594
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,160
you can buy

595
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,759
those American sneakers

596
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:57,400
with US dollars!

597
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,359
American sneakers.

598
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,880
American sneakers.

599
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,759
No need to ask me for money.

600
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,519
Buy Xun a robot.

601
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,359
Yes, yes.

602
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,519
Buy a robot.

603
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Madam.

604
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,800
Madam.

605
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,119
Who are you?

606
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:46,959
You scared me!

607
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,759
Did someone come by earlier?

608
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,040
What?

609
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Well, the stuff

610
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
at that grave.

611
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,240
The one who delivered a cake?

612
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,240
She was here.

613
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,079
She comes every year at this time.

614
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,559
She always cleans the place spotless,

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
and comes with a cake.

616
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,119
Where is she now?

617
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,239
She just dropped the stuff

618
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,199
and left.

619
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
Thanks, madam.

620
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:53,344
(Tang Yixun's Grave)

621
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:06,592
(Happy Birthday, Xun)

622
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
(Xun.)

623
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,079
(I'll celebrate
your birthday today, okay?)

624
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:54,960
(Tang Yixun's Grave)

625
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
(So it's settled.)

626
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,199
(I'll be with you
on your birthday every year.)

627
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,400
(It's too late today.)

628
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,880
(Birthday cakes were sold out.)

629
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,159
(I only found this rice cake.)

630
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,559
(But next year,)

631
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
(I'll definitely get you)

632
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,000
(a huge birthday cake,)

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,400
(covered with candles.)

634
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,600
(Okay?)

635
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:40,192
(Public Phone:
Local, National, International)

636
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm closing up.

637
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:49,152
(Zhenxing Grocery Store)

638
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,200
I'm closing up.

639
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,760
Make it quick.

640
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,760
Hurry up.

641
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,919
Hello.

642
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,760
Hello.

643
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,840
Cheng?

644
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,719
Who is it?

645
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Whose call is this?

646
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
Mom, they don't speak.

647
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,079
Give it to me.

648
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:39,919
Hello.

649
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,200
Who is this?

650
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,119
Probably a wrong number.

651
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,199
I made sweet and sour ribs.

652
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,079
(When I make money,)

653
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,320
(I'll take you traveling.)

654
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,679
(Any place you want to visit?)

655
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
(I want to see snowfall.)

656
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,960
(I've never seen heavy snow.)

657
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,079
(Me neither.)

658
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,519
(When I make money,)

659
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:58,599
(we'll go)

660
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,480
(wherever it snows.)

661
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,640
(Deal.)

662
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,000
Who's there?

663
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,280
Come in.

664
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Can I help you?

665
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,800
I...

666
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,719
I'm Yu Zhiyong's friend.

667
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,679
I came to visit you.

668
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,159
Well, come in.

669
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,240
Dad.

670
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,240
Dad.

671
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
Nian.

672
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:31,479
Look.

673
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,039
So many delicious dishes.

674
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,719
Plenty of food.

675
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,480
Here, let's eat.

676
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,760
Thank you.

677
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,400
I shouldn't let guests cook.

678
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,680
Eat while it's hot.

679
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:54,359
Here.

680
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,480
Try this.

681
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,800
Dad.

682
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,320
Grandma says you drive big trucks,

683
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:23,840
the really huge ones.

684
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,079
Where do you drive them, Dad?

685
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,400
Whenever I ask Grandma,

686
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,039
she says you're down south,

687
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,599
very far away.

688
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,840
So every time,

689
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,559
it takes forever for you to come back.

690
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,479
Dad.

691
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,639
Can I come with you?

692
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,039
Nian.

693
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,800
Focus on eating.

694
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,320
Good girl.

695
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,199
I always cough.

696
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,000
Dad's cooking

697
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,599
is so delicious.

698
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,920
Can I have it tomorrow?

699
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,079
Nian.

700
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,199
From now on,

701
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,079
I will cook delicious meals
for you every day.

702
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,840
Okay?

703
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,039
Okay.

704
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,879
Okay.

705
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,200
Have some more.

706
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,160
Here.

707
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,079
Try this.

708
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,360
Have some meat.

709
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,240
Have some water.

710
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,599
Dr. Hao just told me

711
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,239
you have

712
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,280
improved these days.

713
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:19,559
I know how serious my illness is.

714
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,679
Don't waste money on me.

715
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:24,999
Don't worry about

716
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,320
the money.

717
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:27,959
Take good rest.

718
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,079
Kid,

719
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,360
you promised Yong to visit us

720
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,119
and travelled all this way.

721
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,519
It is already enough.

722
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,440
We've taken too much of your time.

723
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:45,599
Don't let us

724
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,679
hold you back.

725
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,559
Since I'm here,

726
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:54,519
I can't just leave.

727
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,280
I have no home,

728
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,800
no mom,

729
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,079
and no one around.

730
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,360
If you don't mind,

731
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:09,159
I'll treat you well for Yong.

732
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,000
I'll be your son.

733
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,360
I'll take care

734
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:18,039
of you and Nian.

735
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:54,399
Dr. Wang.

736
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,119
Is there any other way?

737
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,440
Money's not the issue.

738
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,159
I understand how you feel,

739
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:01,039
but your mother's illness

740
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,320
isn't looking good.

741
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,079
Prepare the funeral.

742
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:34,500
(Xi Town, Beixing, City Bus)

743
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,720
Dad.

744
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,840
Where are we going?

745
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:53,599
Nian,

746
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,360
you're going to kindergarten.

747
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,159
We'll live in a big apartment.

748
00:47:59,159 --> 00:47:59,999
Okay?

749
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,800
Nian.

750
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,000
Look over there.

751
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,160
A big ship!

752
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,079
Dad, will we ride that ship?

753
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:34,760
Nian,

754
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,239
do you like big ships?

755
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,599
Yes.

756
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:40,920
Then we'll buy a home

757
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,679
and stay here. Okay?

758
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:44,119
Anywhere is fine

759
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,200
when I'm with you.

760
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,760
Dad, let's race!

761
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:49,960
Ready? Go!

762
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:52,559
Yong, you're late.

763
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:53,960
Yeah.

764
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,800
Haven't eaten yet?

765
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,399
You worked so hard.

766
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,920
I only made five yuan today.

767
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,920
I still haven't eaten.

768
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:03,440
Need two strong ones.

769
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,719
Coming, sir.

770
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:05,719
What's the job?

771
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,400

No, take it.

882
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,480
Don't.

883
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,440

884
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,239

wasn't in vain.

Don't mention it.

938
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,840

940

Or

941
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,760
I could go cook for you.

942

943
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,599

945

955
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,760
I didn't mean that.

956

957
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:35,119

959
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:39,079
Alright, I understand.

962
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:43,999
Well,

963
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:46,960
if you need help, send Nian to me.

964
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,800
