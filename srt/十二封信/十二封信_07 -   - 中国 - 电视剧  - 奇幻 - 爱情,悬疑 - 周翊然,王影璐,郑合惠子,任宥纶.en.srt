(1981, Meiwan Town)

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,760
Tang.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Where did you get the fish cakes?

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,480
I know you love fish cakes.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,359
So I bought these.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Dig in.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,120
Careful, they're hot.

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,399
Mom, have some first.

9
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,799
There's plenty here.

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,600
I'll eat later.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,200
Go ahead.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Okay.

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,960
You have an appetite?

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,800
Mom.

15
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:42,679
Ye Yibo.

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,519
Get me money.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Go on.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,039
Move.

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,000
Mom.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Where's the money?

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,920
Where's the cash?

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Mom.

23
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,079
Mom.

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,840
Where's the money?

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,679
We're broke.

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,200
Mom.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,920
You've spent every penny.

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,479
Don't you have the factory money?

29
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,799
I need it for an emergency.

30
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,639
You hear me?

31
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,200
I need it for an emergency.

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
Ye Yibo, you've lost it.

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,079
This is illegal.

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,200
How is it illegal?

35
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,120
I need money...

36
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,400
I don't want fish cakes anymore.

37
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,359
Mom.

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,159
Mom.

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,719
Does it hurt?

40
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,159
I'll never beg for fish cakes again.

41
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,280
It doesn't hurt.

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,719
I'm fine.

43
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Mom,

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
why does Dad always hit you?

45
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,840
Is it because I'm not a boy?

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
Tang, why would you think that?

47
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,400
You'll always be my precious girl.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Understand?

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Mom.

50
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,519
You can treat me like a boy.

51
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
You can call me "Son".

52
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,239
I'll protect you like a son would.

53
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,880
Okay.

54
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,799
From now on, I'll call you "Son".

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,039
Whether boy or girl,

56
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,479
you can protect me.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Listen, Son.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,879
Promise me something, okay?

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,479
In the coming days,

61
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,159
if you hear

62
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,639
me saying,

63
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,319
"Son,

64
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,319
let's have fish cakes at Shiqiao,"

65
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
go straight to Shiqiao

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
and wait for me after school.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,840
Got it?

68
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,719
Got it.

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,439
If you say, "Son,

70
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,199
let's have fish cake at Shiqiao,"

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll go wait there for you.

72
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
That's right.

73
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,680
This is our secret.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,159
Tell no one.

75
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,840
Not even Grandma?

76
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,279
No.

77
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
Not even her.

78
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,479
Okay.

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,639
Should I sing you a lullaby?

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,680
Yeah.

(Xun? I'm Here)

88
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,439
(2026, Pushui)
Coming through.

89
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:27,720
Thanks.

90
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Thanks.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,360
Here.

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
What's new?

94
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,519
Captain Wang.

95
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,639
The victim is female,

96
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,560
aged between 50 and 60.

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,279
Initial judgment: death by drowning.

98
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,319
No identification found.

99
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,560
Burn-like scars on both arms,

100
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,279
old injuries.

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,399
There are signs
of a struggle on the body.

102
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,079
Alright.

103
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,519
I see.

104
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,359
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Hello.

106
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
Shen Cheng?

107
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,159
I'm Wang Meng.

108
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,160
The body was submerged in water
for quite some time.

109
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,680
So, be mentally prepared.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Follow me.

111
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:36,192
(Morgue)

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,079
Calm yourself first.

113
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,239
I'll wait upstairs.

114
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,600
The police said

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
a man was in my mom's passenger seat.

116
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,240
He's the suspect.

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
W-Who is he?

118
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,919
Shen Cheng.

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
Shen Cheng.

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Where are you going?

121
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm telling the police.

122
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
Your dad killed her.

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
H-How could you say that?

124
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,520
Shen Cheng.

125
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Shen Cheng.

126
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
Nothing's confirmed yet.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,519
Shen Cheng.

128
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,639
Who said my dad killed her?

129
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,959
The man in the passenger seat is gone.

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,240
It must be your dad.

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
Shen Cheng.

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,319
You have zero evidence

133
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,639
proving that man was my dad,

134
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,680
not to mention that

135
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
he killed your mom.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
I'll find the evidence.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,279
No.

138
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,360
Shen Cheng.

139
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
I swear on my life.

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
My dad's a good man.

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,920
He would never

142
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
kill anyone.

143
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,120
You swear on your life?

144
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,759
What about my mom?

145
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,279
Who'll answer for her death?

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
Listen, Yu Nian.

147
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
This is murder.

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Your oaths can't fix this.

149
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:09,439
I'll tell the police

150
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,839
everything I know.

151
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,120
They'll give me answers.

152
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,000
Shen Cheng.

153
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,279
No.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,959
My dad wouldn't

155
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,519
kill anyone.

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,080
No.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,880
He wouldn't.

158
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,359
He's not a killer.

159
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
He wouldn't.

160
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,799
He wouldn't.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,519
My dad didn't do it.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,120
He didn't kill her.

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
He didn't kill her.

164
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,159
He didn't.

165
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,879
He didn't kill anyone.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
He didn't.

167
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,479
He wouldn't.

168
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,039
He's not a killer.

169
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
He wouldn't.

170
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,759
He's not a killer.

171
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,879
Dad.

172
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,119
Dad.

173
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,679
Ye Haitang is dead.

174
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,320
This has nothing to do with you,

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,440
right?

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Dad,

177
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,759
where are you?

178
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,279
Please answer me.

179
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,679
Tell me what happened.

180
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
Just let me know.

181
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,639
We can make things right.

182
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,159
Where are you, Dad?

183
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,999
It's not my dad.

184
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,559
It's not my dad.

185
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,399
No.

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,720
It can't be my dad.

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,160
It can't be my dad.

188
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,519
Miaomiao.

189
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,679
Something bad happened here.

190
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,639
Can you look for my dad again?

191
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
What happened?

192
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
I have no time to explain.

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,039
Please look for my dad again.

194
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,840
Something's wrong.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
What do you mean?

196
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,919
Don't scare me.

197
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,080
Listen to me.

198
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,960
Go check our house first,

199
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
then search the neighborhood.

200
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
Then find

201
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,999
the shipyard guard

202
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,240
Zhang Quan.

203
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,240
Keep watch over the mailbox.

204
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,600
What mailbox?

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,960
Stop asking questions.

206
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Go find Zhang Quan.

207
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
He'll explain everything.

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,639
And remember.

209
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,279
If you find my dad,

210
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,039
contact me.

211
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,200
Don't inform anyone else.

212
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,479
And the mailbox.

213
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,759
Don't tell anyone

214
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,879
about the mailbox.

215
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,200
Did you get that?

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Understood?

217
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,240
Got it. I'm heading there now.

218
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I'll go alone.

219
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
Don't worry.

220
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
When will you be back?

221
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,360
Yu Nian, right?

222
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,159
We need your cooperation
in an investigation.

223
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,039
Please come with me.

224
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,560
My dad

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
didn't kill anyone.

226
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,704
(Police Station)

227
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,039
Here, have some water first.

228
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,039
Don't be nervous.

229
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,639
We simply

230
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,679
want to clarify some details.

231
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,559
Is this man in the passenger seat

232
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,719
your father?

233
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,719
No.

234
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,039
That's not my dad.

235
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,599
Are you sure?

236
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,119
I'm sure.

237
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,480
He wasn't wearing

238
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,960
that hat when he left.

239
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,799
He doesn't dress like that.

240
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,360
The body shape doesn't match his.

241
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,840
Do you know

242
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
how he knows Ye Wanru?

243
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
No.

244
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,000
I've never heard him

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,279
mention Ye Wanru before.

246
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,639
Also, my dad has health issues.

247
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
He

248
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,559
sometimes gets confused.

249
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,120
He can't even travel long distances.

250
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
No matter what,

251
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
he has no reason to kill anyone.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,960
Yu Nian, tell me.

253
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,799
Did he ever

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
do anything to you?

255
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
What do you mean?

256
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,999
Here.

257
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,920
Take a look.

258
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,120
Your real father Yu Zhiyong

259
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,279
died of illness in prison back in 2004.

260
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,000
This man impersonated Yu Zhiyong

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,360
and lived with you for years.

262
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
(Died during incarceration)
We don't know his motives.

263
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
So, we can't

264
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
rule out any possibilities.

265
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,399
This is the mailbox?

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
What's it for?

267
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,679
Ma'am.

268
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,840
I don't mean to scare you,

269
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
but you're pregnant.

270
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,720
You shouldn't mess with it.

271
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,120
Take this peach wood sword

272
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,759
to ward off evil spirits.

273
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
This is ridiculous.

274
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
What evil could I attract
in broad daylight?

275
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,279
So what if

276
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,840
I'm pregnant?

277
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,519
I'm not afraid of anything.

278
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
It's fine during the daytime,

279
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,399
but it gets fishy at night.

280
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,519
That's good.

281
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,000
I'd like to see

282
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,039
what magic this mailbox can produce.

283
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
A pregnant lady like you

284
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,919
shouldn't meddle in this.

285
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,559
Why do you mind me being pregnant?

286
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,559
It's none of your business.

287
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,240
Step aside.

288
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,159
I'm pregnant. So what?

289
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,759
I'm just concerned.

290
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
I promised Yu Nian I'd watch it,

291
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,840
and I'll see it through.

292
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
Stay if you want,

293
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,759
or go guard your shack instead.

294
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
Totally decent.

295
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,599
True friend.

296
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,879
Very honorable.

297
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,440
Fine, stay here then.

298
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,280
I have to go.

299
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,040
Get back here.

300
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,519
What?

301
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,359
Come back.

302
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,480
Told you to take the sword.

303
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,519
That's not it.

304
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
What's your daily rate?

305
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,999
That's private.

306
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Holy cow. Must be loaded.

307
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Private? Really?

308
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,719
I'll give you 300.

309
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
Post these around.

310
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,720
(Missing Person)
We would've found him if he were here.

311
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
This is useless.

312
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Don't be so rigid.

313
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,200
We can try it when all else fails.

314
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Maybe we can find him.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
What's the problem?

316
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Want more money?

317
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,440
It's not about the money.

318
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,639
Then I won't pay you.

319
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,399
Want the money?

320
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,879
Yes. Transfer it via WeChat.

321
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,759
I'm going now.

322
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,240
Text me if anything comes up.

323
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
This is ridiculous.

324
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,840
Bye, ma'am.

325
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,920
Post them everywhere.

326
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,519
Bye.

327
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,679
Say bye to me.

328
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,160
Bye.

329
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,120
What a nice place.

330
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,840
But the house is too old.

331
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
Liu.

332
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,759
Tear it all down.

333
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
Who are they?

334
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,399
No idea.

335
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,480
Rebuild the foundation.

336
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
We can totally build
a nice three-story house.

337
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,240
Those are not Bao's men.

338
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,759
Probably some debt collectors.

339
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,600
Ye Haitang.

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,360
The environment...

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Ye Haitang.

342
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,080
The weather...

343
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Who are you?

344
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,879
You are...?

345
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
This is my house.

346
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,879
Ye Yibo owes me money.

347
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,960
This house is collateral.

348
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,039
Look at this.

349
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,519
He signed this IOU.

350
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,639
(IOU)
It's clear.

351
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,560
Young man.

352
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
Trying to snatch it?

353
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,200
Where are you from?

354
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,840
I don't answer to you.

355
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,000
At most,

356
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,039
I'll let you take your stuff out.

357
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,720
You're claiming the house
with a scrap of paper?

358
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,720
In broad daylight,

359
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,960
you dare to rob us?

360
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,720
Don't be so rude, young man.

361
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,759
Ye Yibo mortgaged

362
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,559
this house to me.

363
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,879
I'm just following the procedure.

364
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,919
It's not Ye Yibo's house.

365
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,639
He had no right to mortgage it.

366
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,200
Has he ever

367
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,279
shown you the house deed?

368
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,960
Unless you repay what he owes me

369
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,600
plus interest,

370
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,200
you'd better stop making trouble.

371
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:37,879
Here's the deal.

372
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,039
Let us get our things.

373
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
Okay?

374
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,719
No problem.

375
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,080
Get to work.

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,840
Xun.

377
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
Go in. I'll handle this.

378
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,639
Go inside.

379
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,359
What are you doing?

380
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
What are you doing?

381
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,000
Even hooligans need principles.

382
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,480
Ye Yibo owes you money.

383
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,240
This house doesn't belong to him.

384
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,079
If you want to take it,

385
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,640
kill me first.

386
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,839
Who are you?

387
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,039
None of your business.

388
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,480
Try and take one more step.

389
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,960
Who are you trying to scare?

390
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
You can take us all?

391
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,680
I'll take down as many as I can.

392
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,440
Go ahead. Cut me.

393
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,279
Xun.

394
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,159
Come on.

395
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Come on.

396
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,240
Keep going.

397
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,919
Kid,

398
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm here for the house.

399
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,279
I won't lower myself

400
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,240
to fight kids.

401
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,640
Go back and tell Ye Yibo.

402
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,440
This is not over.

403
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,480
Let's go.

404
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,840
Get out.

405
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,119
It's okay.

406
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,839
We scared them off.

407
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,839
Those people are like that.

408
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,520
Cowards.

409
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,959
Tang Yixun.

410
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,160
(Property deed)
I'm giving up the house.

411
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,599
Why?

412
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,119
You're afraid they'll come back?

413
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,640
Don't worry.

414
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm here for you.

415
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,960
I won't let them take the house.

416
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,720
But I can't let you
fight them with a knife

417
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
every time.

418
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,839
Another gang may come

419
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,920
to bother us any day.

420
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,559
I don't know

421
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,880
how much debt Ye Yibo owes.

422
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,839
But as long as I hold the deed,

423
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,559
he'll never stop coming after it.

424
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,359
Why should we be scared?

425
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,440
Ye Haitang, trust me.

426
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
As long as I'm alive,

427
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,519
nobody takes this house.

428
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,799
You matter more.

429
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,160
Please page 9223 for me.

430
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,039
To Mr. Ye.

431
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,359
It's about the house.

432
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,359
Return immediately. Ye Haitang.

433
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,720
Will he come back?

434
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Rest assured.

435
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,039
Sir, I left the money on the table.

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,840
Alright.

437
00:21:53,363 --> 00:22:01,216
(Relationship Severance Agreement
Ye Haitang, September 5, 1991)

438
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,759
Are you crazy?

439
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
You called me back to sign this?

440
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
Where's the deed?

441
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,359
Sign and fingerprint it.

442
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,960
Then you get the deed.

443
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,319
Who taught you this?

444
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,039
Was it that punk?

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,279
I'm not buying it.

446
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,679
The house deed.

447
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,359
Where did you hide it?

448
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,119
Sign and fingerprint it.

449
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,400
Then you get the deed.

450
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,679
Tang.

451
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm not trying to sell our house.

452
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
I just want to mortgage it

453
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
to pay off the debts first.

454
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,240
We'll reclaim it once I make money.

455
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,559
The house will be here.

456
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,839
You'd sever ties over this house?

457
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,359
That's unnecessary.

458
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,880
Remember what you did to me

459
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,080
for this house?

460
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
Tang.

461
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
Tang, I failed you.

462
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,119
I had no choice.

463
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,000
I made a stupid mistake.

464
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,559
Can you forgive me?

465
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,599
You can't cut me off.

466
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
You're my only family.

467
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,160
When you were young,

468
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
I treated you well.

469
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,599
I took you out every day

470
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,119
and bought you treats.

471
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,039
Right?

472
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,960
I raised you through hardships.

473
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,359
Grandma raised me,

474
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,720
not you, Ye Yibo.

475
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,400
In primary school...

476
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,319
When your debts pile up,

477
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,200
it can be fatal.

478
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,440
Take the deed.

479
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,559
Pay off your debts,

480
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,440
and we're square.

481
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,480
If you don't do as I say,

482
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,079
you'll never get the deed.

483
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,079
No one will ever claim this house.

484
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,640
Xun.

485
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,399
You okay?

486
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm fine.

487
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
It's all set.

488
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,080
That's good.

489
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,200
Where's your luggage?

490
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,279
I only brought Grandma and my books.

491
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,039
Nothing else matters.

492
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,440
I'm leaving them behind.

493
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah, nothing else matters.

494
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,720
Alright.

495
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,679
Let's go home.

496
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,280

499
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,400
It's their new stock.

500
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,480
It has a filling.

501
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,759
It must be delicious.

502
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:00,879

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,079
I want to buy

578
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,440
some women's outfits.

579
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,399
When

580
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,039
did you start having ideas

581
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,839
about cross-dressing?

582
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,279
What are you thinking?

583
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,040
It's for her.

584
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
You finally came around to it.

585
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,039
You're dating her?

586
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,880
Shut up. Don't talk nonsense.

587
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,480
She left home without packing anything.

588
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm getting clothes for her.

589
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,039
Alright.

590
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,160
No problem.

591
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,720
Leave this to me.

592
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,039
I'm the trendiest guy

593
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,920
in Meiwan, let alone on Fenxiang Road.

594
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:53,759
Here's the plan.

595
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,759
Come with me after school tomorrow.

596
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,359
Alright.

597
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,240
Move over.

598
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,359
Why are you lying down?

599
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm going to sleep.

600
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,119
Go sleep at your own place.

601
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
You have a bed at home. Go home.

602
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,800
Leave me alone.

603
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,839
There's someone at home.
It's inconvenient.

604
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,720
Zhenzhu.

605
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,839
Ye Haitang is sleeping at his place.

606
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,799
Ye Haitang is sleeping at his place.

607
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,760
Ye Haitang...

608
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,119
What are you doing?

609
00:31:34,515 --> 00:31:36,319
(Sunshine Bookstore)

610
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,039
Kitty, come out.

611
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Hu.

612
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,920
What are you doing?

613
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,200
It's dangerous. What's wrong?

614
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,559
I saw a kitty crawl inside.

615
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,880
I must save it.

616
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,960
Look.

617
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,599
This gap is so narrow.

618
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
Kitties can't get in.

619
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,919
Is there a kitty?

620
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,080
Nothing, right?

621
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,359
Let me check.

622
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,640
Let's open it and see.

623
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:00,839
Where's the kitty?

624
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,720
I saw it crawl in here.

625
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,880
It probably went somewhere else.

626
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,039
There's just a pile of letters, right?

627
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,839
Come on, let's check inside the house

628
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,039
and see if the kitty's there.

629
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,119
Let's go.

630
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,199
Where's the kitty?

631
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,680
The letters go here.

632
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:26,400
(Zihua Pavilion)

633
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
This school might as well
be their family business.

634
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,319
They come and go

635
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,920
as they please.

636
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,839
Exactly.

637
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,079
How arrogant.

638
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Take a look.

639
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
What is it?

640
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:50,879
Look at this.

641
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,960
(Expel Tang Yixun)
Joint petition.

642
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,160
Class 1, Grade 12.

643
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Who wrote this?

644
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,280
What is this?

645
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
It's nothing. Go back.

646
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:19,919
I got this.

647
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Like my outfit?

648
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
Yeah.

649
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,760
It's from Hong Kong.

650
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Don't worry.

651
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,080
Alright.

652
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,279
Did you write this?

653
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,359
Ye Haitang.

654
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,640
This petition
voices everyone's concerns.

655
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,799
I did nothing wrong.

656
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,879
Step aside.

657
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,759
Is this how you all feel?

658
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,920
You dare sign but not admit it?

659
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,039
Signing shows our collective opinion.

660
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,079
If you won't sign,

661
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,639
nobody's forcing you.

662
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,400
Stop disturbing everyone.

663
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,240
Okay?

664
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,119
Shen Xiaojun.

665
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,599
Who's been disturbing everyone?

666
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,719
Wake up, Ye Haitang.

667
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,519
You're the class monitor.

668
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,840
Your grades are decent.

669
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,480
But since he arrived,

670
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,079
look at what you've become.

671
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,840
It's embarrassing to watch.

672
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,840
Ever since

673
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,559
someone joined us,

674
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,679
our entire class

675
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,119
has become the laughingstock.

676
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,280
Just think about it.

677
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,639
Who's disturbing
our innocent classmates?

678
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,760
Who's ruining

679
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,480
our entire class?

680
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
Those are my personal matters.

681
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,119
They can laugh at me

682
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,039
if they want to.

683
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,440
Why does it concern you?

684
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,880
What right do you have to expel him?

685
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,119
The petition claims
that Tang Yixun beats his classmates.

686
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,719
Who's been beaten by Tang Yixun?

687
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:01,879
Please step forward.

688
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,840
He harasses female students.

689
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,480
Which female student

690
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,880
has been harassed by him?

691
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,000
Please step forward.

692
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,159
He severely disturbs people's studies.

693
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,400
Whose grades dropped
because of Tang Yixun?

694
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,800
Please step forward.

695
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,840
Since nobody's coming forward,

696
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,840
it means our fellow classmates

697
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,679
still know right from wrong.

698
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,119
We can't expel someone

699
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,559
just for poor grades.

700
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,480
I'll tutor him myself.

701
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
We can improve together.

702
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,480
Even if he gets tutored,
he'll still be the black sheep.

703
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,119
Who's been bullying
and mocking classmates all along?

704
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,199
You're the only one

705
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,599
who's disturbing our classmates.

706
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,280
You are the real black sheep
in our class.

707
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,199
Say that again.

708
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,840
Cut your usual act.

709
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,559
We came here to study,

710
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,039
not to be bullied by you.

711
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,679
If you keep causing trouble,

712
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,360
forget about attending school.

713
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,480
What's wrong with you?

714
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,280
You're scared by a lunatic?

715
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,440
For real?

716
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,079
What did we agree on?

717
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,000
Shen Xiaojun.

718
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,480
What are you doing?

719
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,440
Class begins.

720
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
Stand up.

721
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,480
Good morning, sir.

722
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,880
Good morning. Sit down, please.

723
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,079
Turn to Unit Three.

724
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,719
Still no reply?

725
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,400
It's okay.

726
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,840
We always had to wait a few days.

727
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,360
I wonder when we'll get the reply.

728
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,159
Let's go buy a bed

729
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,440
and tidy up the house.

730
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,440
Forget about

731
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,280
the bed.

732
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
Leave it to me.

733
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,039
I've got some things to do.

734
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,039
I have to go.

735
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,199
What is it?

736
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,519
Well, Rat asked me

737
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,079
to go shopping with him.

738
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,480
Buddies Billiards is reopening soon.

739
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,840
I have to go.

740
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,680
Go ahead then.

741
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,079
Alright.

742
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,840
See you back home.

743
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm off.

744
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,280
Even the most handsome guy
needs nice clothes.

745
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:05,399
This is the place.

746
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,119
I'm a regular here.

747
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,679
(Clothes shop)
Come again soon.

748
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's not be shy about it.

749
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,719
Excuse me.

750
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,559
Madam.

751
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,039
Do you have

752
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,960
any trendy women's clothes?

753
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,519
This one looks nice.

754
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,719
It's from the movie...

755
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,840
What was it called?

756
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:21,639
Never mind.

757
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,440
What matters is
that Joey Wong wore this.

758
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,360
Joey Wong!

759
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:25,639
Well...

760
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,599
This isn't appropriate for school.

761
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,480
Says who?

762
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,559
Who says students
can't dress like Joey Wong?

763
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,320
It looks great.

764
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,639
Joey Wong doesn't even
go to school, dude.

765
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,800
It really looks nice.

766
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
You...

767
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,119
So what do you want?

768
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,039
She didn't bring anything

769
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,039
when she left.

770
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,440
I just want to buy her
some nice outfits.

771
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,639
She's never worn dresses.

772
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,440
This is too flashy.

773
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,719
She won't feel comfortable.

774
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,599
We need something subtle and plain.

775
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,800
The schoolgirl style.

776
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,640
Got it.

777
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,360
Keep it plain.

778
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,880
This one's plain

779
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,720
and rustic-looking.

780
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,840
Wrap this one up first.

781
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,360
Alright.

782
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,440
It's okay.

783
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,639
First-time shoppers should

784
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,679
get everything.

785
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,239
Come on.

786
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,360
Let's look around.

787
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,039
Tell you what.

788
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,639
Tang will definitely love these.

789
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,840
So many styles.

790
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,119
Such a nice gesture.

791
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,559
It's impressive.

792
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:21,880
Listen,

793
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,639
after you go back,

794
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,440
hang all these clothes on the wall.

795
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,840
Match the colors.

796
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
It'll be romantic.

797
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,119
That's way too much.

798
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,440
No way. Girls love this stuff.

799
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,840
Alright, that's it.

800
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,679
I'm done here.

801
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,800
I still have things to do.

802
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Hurry home and set it up.

803
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,800
Alright, see you around.

804
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
Get going.

805
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,880
That's way too much.

806
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,840
I'm not doing that.

807
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,680
Hang them up.

808
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,239
Please, sis.

809
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,440
Knock off just a little more
for that dress.

810
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,519
I really can't afford it.

811
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,559
I just brought you

812
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,920
a decent client.

813
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,159
We didn't haggle over anything.

814
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:57,840
Right, sis?

815
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,599
Have some candy.

816
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,760
This dress was expensive to begin with.

817
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,960
This is not even the wholesale price.

818
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
Is this how you treat

819
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,679
your regular customer?

820
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,519
This won't do.

821
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,639
Give me a better discount.

822
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,920
Give me a break, kiddo.

823
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,720
I'm buying it.

824
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,840
No bargaining.

825
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,920
Wrap it up, ma'am.

826
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,000
Alright.

827
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,039
Why did I even call you "sis"?

828
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,440
I never call anyone "sis".

829
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Your change.

830
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,720
Okay.

831
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:29,879
Tang.

832
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,960
I'll pick up Hu.

833
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,679
Remember to lock up when you leave.

834
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,079
Sir.

835
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:34,999
What's wrong?

836
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,880
Do you still need that old bed

837
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,920
in the warehouse?

838
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,320
It's broken. The support rod's snapped.

839
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,599
It's useless now. Why?

840
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,239
Can you sell it to me cheap?

841
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,599
But it's broken.

842
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,760
Just take it if you need it.

843
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Don't bother paying.

844
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,239
Thank you, sir.

845
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,079
No problem.

846
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:54,840
Can you carry it?

847
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,440
Yeah.

848
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,000
Be careful.

849
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,840
It's messy in there.

850
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,239
Okay, thank you, sir.

851
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,239
What's so romantic about this?

852
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,120
Xun.

853
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,280
Look what I got.

854
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,719
Does it look nice?

855
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,720
Yeah.

856
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,480
I find it pretty, too.

857
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,119
Aren't these shoes too big?

858
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,199
No, they fit perfectly.

859
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,039
How are they fitting?

860
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,039
They look way too big.

861
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,320
This was

862
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,840
the only size left in the shop.

863
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,680
I was worried.

864
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,079
It's fine. I'll add insoles

865
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,559
and stuff some paper in them.

866
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,239
Let me try this on, okay?

867
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:31,399
Okay.

868
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,960
Why's it raining all of a sudden?

869
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:42,199
Let's wait here.

870
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,679
Why are you smiling?

871
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:52,079
I just think

872
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,760
this is kind of fun.

873
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,039
Look.

874
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,360
What're you doing?
Come here. It's raining.

875
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,239
Come on, join me.

876
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,400
But I'm wearing the new dress.

877
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,440
I bought three in total.

878
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,840
Wear a different one tomorrow.

879
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:05,119
It's already dirty.

880
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:05,559
Come on.

881
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,440

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,800
Cha.

959
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,119
Can we open officially tomorrow?

960
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:39,199
Yeah.

961
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,000
So let's do one final check later

962
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:42,400
on the balls and cues.

963
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,760
Make sure everything's perfect.

964
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,000
No problem.

965
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,199
Best wishes on your opening.

966
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,440
Cha.

967
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,480
Wishing you prosperity.

968
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,519
Cha.

969
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:05,920
Why didn't you tell me the good news?

970
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,320
I could've sent flowers.

971
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:10,800
Bao, our small business

972
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:12,119
doesn't really need

973
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,320
your concern.

974
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,440
Even a small business
makes money, right?

975
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,519
At least show me your devotion.

976
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:30,320
It would be a shame

977
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:31,599
if this place

978
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:33,559
got trashed again.

979
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,800
Bao, why are you trying

980
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,719
to intimidate us again?

981
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,519
Don't run a business if you're so timid.

982
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:47,999
Don't be scared.

983
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,719
I've got your back.

984
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,760
Qiang.

985
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,680
Bao.

986
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,760
Starting today,

987
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,960
tell the boys to keep watch here.

988
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,159
Got it.

989
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:57,999
What do you want?

990
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,480
This billiard house

991
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:06,359
is mine now.

992
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,280
Let's see.

993
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,760
Well-renovated, huh?

994
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,800
Cha.

995
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Yeah, nice work.

996
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,880
Check this out.

997
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,960
Huge sofa. I love it.

998
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,159
(He's been my dad since I can remember.)

999
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,360
I also grew up

1000
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,639
with my grandma.

1001
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,920
It can't be wrong.

1002
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,519
He can't be someone else.

1003
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:36,359
Yu Nian.

1004
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,119
Records show you were born in 2002.

1005
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,239
Yu Zhiyong was imprisoned in 2001.

1006
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:42,959
When

1007
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,719
did that man first appear?

1008
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,079
My dad used to drive trucks.

1009
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:50,119
I don't remember

1010
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,119
when he came home.

1011
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,440
But my grandma couldn't have been wrong.

1012
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
She always called

1013
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,079
my dad "Dayong".

1014
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,159
Everyone in our hometown knows

1015
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,079
my dad is Yu Zhiyong.

1016
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,039
How could he be someone else?

1017
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,119
Alright, keep thinking.

1018
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,039
Captain Wang.

1019
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:19,400
Yeah?

1020
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,519
The fingerprint match
from his house came back.

1021
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:22,359
So fast?

1022
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,239
Just as you suspected.

1023
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:25,359
Ex-convict.

1024
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,639
(Criminal file: Tang Yixun)
This is Tang Yixun,

1025
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
convicted of
involuntary manslaughter in 1991.

1026
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,679
He served 13 years.

1027
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,320
Involuntary manslaughter.
