(To Ye Haitang)

2
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,600
Yu Nian.

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,079
Thank you.

4
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:48,960
You may leave.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
Is it from your dad?

6
00:01:13,795 --> 00:01:16,672
(Tang Yixun)

7
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,879
Is your dad named Tang Yixun?

8
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:58,432
=Twelve Letters=

00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:02,611
=Episode 9=
(If...)

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
How is it? Are you cold?

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,439
Help me up.

12
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't even stand up.

13
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,919
I'm frozen stiff.

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,840
Frozen stiff?

15
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,960
You insisted on coming.

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,439
What if you catch a cold,

17
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,199
or get scared?

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,000
Indeed. I might catch a cold.

19
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,960
But I get scared?

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Impossible.

21
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,639
I've seen everything.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,759
We've waited all night,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,120
yet nothing comes

24
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,039
from the mailbox.

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,199
What does Yu Nian mean?

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,919
What's the wrong with this mailbox?

27
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,960
So spooky.

28
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,719
Look.

29
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,120
Nothing.

30
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,280
It doesn't occur every night.

31
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,599
Depends on the situation.

32
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,159
Listen to me.

33
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,039
You go back first.

34
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,159
I'll keep watch for you.

35
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
I'll tell you once letters come.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,580
Then you come back.

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,199
Well...

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
I'll go take a nap.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,199
Message me anytime.

40
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,479
Give out
missing person notices tomorrow.

41
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,560
Three hundred.

42
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,479
Okay.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,639
Keep watch.

44
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,240
A stray cat?

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,639
What's that noise?

46
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,039
It occurs.

47
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,360
I told you.

48
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,759
Are you okay?

49
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,199
Shen Cheng.

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,240
We got a reply.

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,879
What does it mean?

52
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,368
(My kid, let's go to Shiqiao today.
For fish cakes.)

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
Are you sure

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,399
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

55
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,319
Yes.

56
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,560
Which means

57
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,720
that must be Ye Haitang from 1991.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,480
Yes.

59
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,360
My mom is still alive.

60
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,040
She lives in the year 1991 over there.

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,439
300 missing person notices

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,319
were all

63
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,360
posted up.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,639
Exhausted.

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,839
Listen up.

66
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,920
When I came back,

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,199
that woman was still there.

68
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,120
Listen,

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
your friend

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,079
is really something.

71
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,519
She's pregnant,

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680
but not fragile at all.

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Though she likes to brag,

74
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,120
claiming she's bold.

75
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,800
But when the letter came,

76
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,120
she passed out from fright.

77
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,439
Passed out?

78
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,439
Is she okay?

79
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,240
Is the baby alright?

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Yes. I took her to the hospital.

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
The doctor said...

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,040
Are you sure?

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,079
She just got scared. Okay.

84
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,879
The baby is fine.

85
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,040
Are you crazy?

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Why tell others about this matter?

87
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,839
What do you mean?

88
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,160
Aren't we in the same team?

89
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,240
Shen...

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Shen Cheng!

91
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,079
What's wrong with him?

92
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,439
Why slammed the door?

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,720
Weren't you calling us

94
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,120
scammers?

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,639
Now you're worried about leaks?

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
How ridiculous!

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,639
Why slammed the door?

98
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,759
Where's your manners?

99
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,040
My mom says it would get bad luck!

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,759
Enough.

101
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,519
Mind your manners.

102
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,639
Don't blame him.

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,519
What's wrong?

104
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,560
Is he your boss?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,160
His mom's gone.

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Where to?

107
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
She's passed away.

108
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,160
Don't blame him.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,199
Dead?

110
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,639
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm really sorry.

112
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,800
I didn't know.

113
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,160
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,199
I noticed he was acting different.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,519
Losing his mom must be heartbroken.

116
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,120
Alright. Stop it.

117
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,920
Wait,

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
we just received a letter.

119
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,120
19 years old.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,920
That must be his mom.

121
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,639
Cheng.

122
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,120
Don't be sad.

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,920
Come out.

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,920
She's still alive.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,199
She's living in the other world.

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Stop it.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,720
Come out and discuss

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,879
how to reply the letter.

129
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:30,848
(Avoid him now.)

130
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,839
What does it mean?

131
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,199
(He'll put you in danger.)
He'll put you in danger?

132
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,959
Give me.

133
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,519
I'll write.

134
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,279
Give me the letter!

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,279
Shen Cheng!

136
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:43,759
What?

137
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,439
Shen Cheng, explain yourself!

138
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,639
That letter isn't just yours.

139
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,399
Calm down.

140
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,000
Shen Cheng!

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,040
Careful.

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,639
Stop!

143
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,160
Careful.

144
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,160
Shen Cheng!

145
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,639
Keep your voice down.

146
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,439
Ma'am.

147
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,680
Don't provoke him.

148
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,639
Let him write what he wants.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,240
Don't delay important matters.

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
(Police)

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,079
This is where you used to live.

152
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,360
Do you remember?

153
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,639
Yes.

154
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,080
I used to live here.

155
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,120
We went to investigate.

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,159
Some old neighbors

157
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,600
remember your current father.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,480
He returned a year before you moved.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,960
A year before?

160
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,360
That's him, right?

161
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,679
That's my father when he was young.

162
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,360
His name is Tang Yixun.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
In 1991,

164
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,639
he was imprisoned for manslaughter.

165
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,200
Due to good behavior,

166
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,399
he was transferred to

167
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,440
Yu Zhiyong's prison for hit-and-run.

168
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,200
They became cellmates

169
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,200
and grew very close.

170
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,039
Later, Yu Zhiyong

171
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,480
fell ill

172
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,799
and died in prison.

173
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,399
I think he received

174
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,799
Yu Zhiyong's dying wish

175
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
to go to your hometown

176
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,519
and care for you and your grandma.

177
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,960
Just...

178
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,759
Just because of a dying wish?

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,799
This seems the most likely reason.

180
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,120
But first, we need to find him.

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,559
We found his identity.

182
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,679
That simplifies things.

183
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,080
We'll contact you

184
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,039
once we have updates.

185
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,480
Okay?

186
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,840
This mailbox stays,

187
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,159
while people come and go.

188
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,679
Everyone who sits here freezes up.

189
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,919
Bro.

190
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,600
Put this on.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,799
You'll catch a cold.

192
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,960
Yu Nian told me everything.

193
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,919
Sorry to hear that.

194
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,399
I don't know how to comfort you.

195
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,440
You must have

196
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
gone through a lot.

197
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,360
I won't ask further

198
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,679
to spare you more distress.

199
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,159
Go back soon.

200
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,840
It's freezing.

201
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,120
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

202
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,320
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

203
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,600
Fairly well.

204
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,759
We interacted for months.

205
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,600
What kind of person is he?

206
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,399
He?

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,759
An old man.

208
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,159
An old folk.

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,159
He sat here every day.

210
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,440
Quite stubborn.

211
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,399
Just like you.

212
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,840
He brought me steamed buns twice.

213
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,039
I think

214
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,720
he's a good person.

215
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,440
It's freezing.

216
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
You should go back soon.

217
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,000
Bye-bye.

218
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,631
(Ye Haitang's personal information)

219
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:24,896
(Middle school, Dropout)

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
He sat by the mailbox all night.

221
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,159
Just sat there wide-eyed.

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
I worried he'd freeze.

223
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,600
How do you guys handle the cold so well?

224
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll go check on him.

225
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
He doesn't let me reply now.

226
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
What if he gets a reply?

227
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,360
I'll join him.

228
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,679
Coming.

229
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:44,799
Coming.

230
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,879
You'll break the door.

231
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,679
Bro.

232
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Got a reply?

233
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,399
Freezing cold?

234
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,159
Thank you.

235
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:56,879
No problem.

236
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,519
Where to?

237
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,039
What happened?

238
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,799
Leaving now?

239
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,919
He just left?

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,080
How could he just leave?

241
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,840
Wait.

242
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,919
Where are you going?

243
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll follow him.

244
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,639
Police only tells him

245
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,600
about updates.

246
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,159
I need

247
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,200
to follow him.

248
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,399
He doesn't tell you?

249
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,879
He's immediate family.

250
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,879
I'm at a disadvantage now.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Inform Miaomiao for me.

252
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,279
I'm leaving Beixing to you.

253
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,539
Leave it to you, Quan.

254
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,279
I'm leaving.

255
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,200
You got this!

256
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,759
Wait...

257
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,399
You...

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,519
Leave it to me?

259
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,039
Can I handle it?

260
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,840
Well...

261
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,279
Such a huge responsibility.

262
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,080
I'll handle it.

263
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,360
This time,

264
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,279
why did you come back?

265
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,679
I know your concerns.

266
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,519
I have one goal,

267
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,440
to find my dad.

268
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,879
If he's done something wrong,

269
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,159
I won't protect him.

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
My mom's resume shows

271
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,399
she quit senior year

272
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:00,544
and didn't take the college exam.

273
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,120
I'll find people

274
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,639
who knew about this.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,720
Which year?

276
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,808
The year Tang Yixun committed the crime.

277
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,039
Did you find anyone?

278
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,664
(Unknown caller)

279
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,440
Hello.

280
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,759
Hello.

281
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,279
Are you Ye Haitang's son?

282
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,759
This is Tan Xin.

283
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,080
Ye Haitang

284
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,799
was hindered by that case.

285
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,639
Tang Yixun's case?

286
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,639
Ye Haitang was involved too?

287
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,440
The town had all kinds of rumors.

288
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Some said

289
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,279
Tang Yixun killed for Ye Haitang.

290
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,799
Others claimed

291
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,919
Ye Haitang did the killing,

292
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,399
and Tang Yixun took the blame for her.

293
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,639
Anyway,

294
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,720
I'm certain

295
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,679
Tang Yixun

296
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,399
would never harm Ye Haitang.

297
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:06,240
Why are you so certain?

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,799
They were my students.

299
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
When Tang Yixun was in prison,

300
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,960
he wrote me a letter.

301
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,039
Said he couldn't burden
Ye Haitang anymore,

302
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,119
or tarnish her life further.

303
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,960
He begged me to help her
retake the twelfth grade.

304
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
Make sure she can get into college

305
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,839
and leave Meiwan safely.

306
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,519
After she got into college,

307
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,039
then we lost contact.

308
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:34,960
Well,

309
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
about that case,

310
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
do you recall any other details?

311
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,079
Time.

312
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,519
It should be

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
November,

314
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,400
around the end of the month,

315
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,000
30th.

316
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,559
Do you know the deceased's name?

317
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,319
Someone mentioned his name.

318
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,359
But it sounded unfamiliar to me.

319
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,759
So I forgot over time.

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,799
My apologies.

321
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Don't mind it.

322
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,839
Please think carefully

323
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,000
if there is anyone else

324
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,799
who was close to them.

325
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,599
For example,

326
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,440
friends, family members,

327
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,400
or classmates from their class.

328
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Anything.

329
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,920
Anything.

330
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,559
Whatever works.

331
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,000
Xun

332
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,599
was an orphan.

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,599
He had a buddy named Zhang Hao
since childhood.

334
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,160
I saw him a few years ago.

335
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,160
Not sure if he's still in Pushui.

336
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,359
His contact...

337
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:28,799
Yes.

338
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,440
Do you have it?

339
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
Well, I need to look for it

340
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,680
when I get home.

341
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,599
I'll send it to you if found.

342
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Great, thank you.

343
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,759
Thank you.

344
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,920
Grandma!

345
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,279
Grandma!

346
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,799
Xixi.

347
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,720
Xixi is here.

348
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
You got a red flower award?

349
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,559
Look, Grandma.

350
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,039
Hello, you two.

351
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,400
Hello.

352
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,799
- Mom.
- Son.

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
This is my son.

354
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:55,599
Hello.

355
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
Miss Tan,

356
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,680
sorry for taking up your time.

357
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:01,680
Thank you.

358
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,160
Not at all.

359
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,440
Here's our address

360
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,640
and our contacts.

361
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,000
Right.

362
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,039
If you recall anything else

363
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,200
or find Zhang Hao's contacts,

364
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,359
please tell us.

365
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,599
Contact us anytime.

366
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:13,960
Okay.

367
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,799
- Anytime.
- Okay.

368
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,079
I will.

369
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:16,960
Thank you.

370
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,720
- Bye.
- Thanks.

371
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,240
Let's go, Xixi.

372
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's go.

373
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Now you know my dad isn't a bad person?

374
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

375
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,359
I want to know

376
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,759
what they went through back then

377
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,920
that they became like this.

378
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,799
If everything hadn't happened,

379
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
would it have been different?

380
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,599
(Ye Haitang.)

381
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,480
(I'm your son Shen Cheng.)

382
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,319
(I don't know
how to describe my feeling now,)

383
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,000
(or explain what's happening.)

384
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,200
(But please believe what I say.)

385
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,039
(In 2026,)

386
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,759
(something terrible happened.)

387
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,440
(I want to know in 1991,)

388
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,640
(if you are doing well.)

389
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,160
(Is there someone
named Tang Yixun around you?)

390
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,119
(Whatever your relationship is,)

391
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,680
(please)

392
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,119
(avoid him now.)

393
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,079
(He'll put you in danger.)

394
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,200
(Believe me, Mom.)

395
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
My son?

396
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,680
You have a son?

397
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,279
Why am I involved?

398
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,799
Why must you avoid me?

399
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,480
Why did he say I'd put you in danger?

400
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,079
How is that possible?

401
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,759
What does it mean?

402
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,720
Wait, who is this person anyway?

403
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,799
Why should we believe him?

404
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,880
He claims he's your son...

405
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,880
Your son's surname is Shen?

406
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,920
So his dad is also a Shen.

407
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,799
Who's his father then?

408
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,319
Shen Xiaojun?

409
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,960
Impossible.

410
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,400
You and Shen Xiaojun are at odds.

411
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,319
How is that possible?

412
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Wait, where am I?

413
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
Am I dead?

414
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,759
Impossible.

415
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,360
If I had died,

416
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,759
I wouldn't write you a love letter.

417
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,559
They wouldn't write

418
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,519
to let you avoid me.

419
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,319
Wait.

420
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,400
Let's calm down.

421
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,839
The letter says

422
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,440
your son's surname is Shen, Shen Cheng.

423
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,279
Told you to avoid me,

424
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,279
I'd put you in danger.

425
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,039
Why would we believe his words?

426
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,799
Didn't you say

427
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,880
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

428
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,480
Right.

429
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Look, the handwriting matches.

430
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,960
So this was written by Shen Cheng.

431
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:36,920
But there's no way

432
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,880
anyone else knows this.

433
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,279
I didn't even tell my grandma.

434
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,319
Wait, does this mean

435
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Yu Nian is your mother?

436
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,200
My mom is Wu Fengying.

437
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,559
Wait, this is so confusing.

438
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,440
None of these names match up.

439
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,640
They mentioned someone earlier...

440
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,279
Yu Zhiyong.

441
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,759
Who's this Yu Zhiyong?

442
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,039
No idea.

443
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,519
Then why did they

444
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,319
write these letters?

445
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,720
Told you to avoid me,

446
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,039
and I'd put you in danger?

447
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,599
What would happen

448
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,519
to us in 2026

449
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,240
has anything to do with us now?

450
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,480
Put this inside.

451
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,480
Tang.

452
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,079
Tang.

453
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,599
The test papers...

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,680
It's fine.

455
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,160
Just test papers. Let them be.

456
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,200
What's wrong?

457
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
This house

458
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,200
leaks every time it rains.

459
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,279
Xun.

460
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,480
It's okay. Really.

461
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,720
I'll rewrite them.

462
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,839
Tang.

463
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,880
Nothing.

465
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,079
It's no big deal.

466
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,079
I thought about it all night.

467
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,440
I must've done something wrong.

468
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,960
Nonsense.

469
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,759
Think about it.

470
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,039
If I did nothing wrong,

471
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:02,960
I'd be by your side

472
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
and they wouldn't make you leave me.

473
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't overthink it.

474
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,839
We don't know what's happening.

475
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,519
Tang, I mean...

476
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
If one day,

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,480
I really put you in danger,

478
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,079
just run away if you can.

479
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,799
Time apart is nothing.

480
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,480
If I'm alive,

481
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,680
I'll come find you.

482
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,079
You won't.

483
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,160
Once we figure this out,

484
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
we'll be safe.

485
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Let's tidy up first.

486
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,359
Tang.

487
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,000
I'll get more tarp from the market.

488
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll go with you.

489
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,839
The mailbox?

490
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Where's it?

491
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,880
Sir.

492
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,440
Sir.

493
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,480
Where's the mailbox?

494
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,480
Mailbox?

495
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Isn't it there?

496
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
- It's gone.
- It's gone!

497
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,960
Probably washed away.

498
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,680
What?

499
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,039
Xun!

500
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,880
No, no!

501
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,920
Kid, get back here!

502
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
Be careful. It's dangerous!

503
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,440
Xun, come up here!

504
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,319
Tang, don't get down!

505
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,960
Come up! Forget the mailbox!

506
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,839
Xun, come up now!

507
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,720
Xun, come up here!

508
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,839
- Come up!
- Xun!

509
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,799
Just let it be.

510
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,920
Why risk your life for it?

511
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,000
Tang.

512
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,359
Be careful, Xun.

513
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,599
Careful.

514
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,320
I'll go look for it.

515
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,039
It's raining heavily.

516
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,559
Don't go out.

517
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:41,200
I need to find that mailbox.

518
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,599
How can I reply without it?

519
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,880
Why did the mailbox

520
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,160
suddenly vanish?

521
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,880
It's raining heavily.

522
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,720
It's an accident.

523
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,519
But the mailbox vanished!

524
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,559
I have to ask them

525
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,119
why they told you to avoid me

526
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,680
and what dangers you might be in.

527
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,480
I know nothing!

528
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,279
Xun.

529
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,480
We can't figure out what happens

530
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,480
with just some words.

531
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,720
Let's go look for it tomorrow.

532
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,200
We won't be apart.

533
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,680
Never.

534
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Okay.

535
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,319
I'll look for it tomorrow.

536
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,000
Every day.

537
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,640
Meiwan is not that big.

538
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,359
I believe I can find it.

539
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:59,480
The Billiards is ready.

540
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,640
And Cha is back on his feet.

541
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,079
Why doesn't Bao

542
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,960
leave you alone?

543
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
What did Qiang tell you that day?

544
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,759
You still go collect debts for them?

545
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,079
As long as we don't work for them,

546
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,720
they can't control us.

547
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,000
Cha.

548
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,400
The rain's stopped.

549
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,799
Take Zhenzhu home.

550
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,920
Don't come over lately.

551
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,039
Tell Xun the same.

552
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,480
We're different from them.

553
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,599
We can still avoid them.

554
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,799
Go.

555
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,856
(Buddies Billiards)

556
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,359
Qiang, the door is locked.

557
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:12,960
No one's there.

558
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,839
This sign can only fool you.

559
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,920
You idiots.

560
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:21,632
(Temporarily Closed)

561
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,240
Fine.

562
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,759
Li Chadong.

563
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,839
Got guts.

564
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,680
Qiang.

565
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:39,200
They're trying to defy us.

566
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
Granny, I will restock for you later.

567
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,559
Alright.

568
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,680
Did Cha contact you?

569
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,599
What should we do?

570
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,160
Just listen to him.

571
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,599
Don't go over there lately.

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,440
If you see Qiang or Fat Dog,

573
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,599
avoid them.

574
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,559
Avoid them?

575
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,559
For how long?

576
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
Shut down
both the Billiards and video parlor?

577
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,599
If we don't,

578
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,839
we'd just earn money for them.

579
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,240
Better do manual labor

580
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,039
than that,

581
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,680
right?

582
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,319
What a curse

583
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,559
to encounter those scumbags.

584
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,519
We can't even

585
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,160
get rid of them.

586
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,039
Get rid of them?

587
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,599
Just smashing them.

588
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,920
Alright.

589
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,839
Xun.

590
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
You go back to school.

591
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,200
I'll help Zhenzhu and Granny

592
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,400
with the sweet soup shop.

593
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,799
Let's get busy.

594
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,039
Things will be okay soon.

595
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,240
Okay.

596
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,480
I hope it didn't hit you.

597
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,000
Hai.

598
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Girl.

599
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,680
Tell Rat and the others

600
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,160
to be cautious.

601
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,079
Otherwise,

602
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,200
I don't know what's in these bottles

603
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,039
next time.

604
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,039
Reading?

605
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:14,759
What do you want?

606
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,240
Get out.

607
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,319
Reading?

608
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,119
What do you want?

609
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:18,799
Take it easy.

610
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,680
Calm down, guys.

611
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,559
What's

612
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,559
going on here?

613
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,880
Sorry, sir.

614
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,599
We're friends with the cashier girl.

615
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,279
We came to buy books.

616
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:28,880
What's wrong?

617
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,920
Not welcoming me?

618
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,200
I'm your friend?

619
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,599
I don't know you at all.

620
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,240
What?

621
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,599
We're your boyfriend's buddies!

622
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,279
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

623
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,759
Can't I buy books here?

624
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Is it against the law?

625
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,160
Come on.

626
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,480
Go ahead.

627
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:51,920
Tang! Tang!

628
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:55,960
Let go.

629
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,759
Let go.

630
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,000
Right.

631
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,559
Hey, here.

632
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,960
Buy some cigarettes.

633
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:06,920
Here.

634
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,000
Here.

635
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:08,679
Here.

636
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,760
Bro, here.

637
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,119
Buy your buddies cigarettes.

638
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:16,679
Sorry.

639
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,599
She is new here.

640
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,239
Come over.

641
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,079
Come over.

642
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,679
Look, he's

643
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,079
really good at it.

644
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,159
Call the police?

645
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,199
Let me tell you.

646
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,159
I've got plenty of time.

647
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,639
I can play with you every day.

648
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,400
Look, are these books

649
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,679
interesting?

650
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,519
Get something more exciting.

651
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,159
Okay? Tell me.

652
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:39,760
Yes.

653
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,800
Say it.

654
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Yes.

655
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,119
I can't hear you!

656
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,119
Yes. Yes.

657
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,079
Good.

658
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,440
Call the police.

659
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,840
Buy books.

660
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,079
Fat Dog.

661
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Let's go.

662
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
Like this one?

663
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,920
What are you staring at?

664
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,440
Want to get beaten?

665
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:14,840
Sir.

666
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,239
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,039
Don't believe them.

668
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,440
I truly don't know them.

669
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
You shouldn't mess

670
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
with them.

671
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,119
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,760
Tang.

673
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,119
It's a small bookstore.

674
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,440
My wife and Hu live here.

675
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
I-I believe you.

676
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,522
But I can't mess with them.

677
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,519
They are barbarians.

678
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,719
Well, listen.

679
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,599
I-I'll

680
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,639
give you this month's salary early.

681
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,199
Take all of it.

682
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,079
You...

683
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,360
Should...

684
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:22,679
Should...

685
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,639
Focus on your studies.

686
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,480
Thank you, sir.

688
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,519
Thanks for taking care of me.

689
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,840
Sorry for causing you trouble.

690
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,039
I'm leaving.

691
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,960
Tang.

692
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,440
Why are you here?

693
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,840
Aren't you working?

694
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,079
I just came back.

695
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,920
What's up?

696
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,440
Xun, is something wrong
at the Billiards?

697
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,360
What do you mean?

698
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,320
Tang.

699
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,119
Did you hear some rumors?

700
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,280
Some punks caused trouble
at the bookstore today.

701
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,679
Punks?

702
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,239
Know their names?

703
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,920
I don't know.

704
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:25,920
Never seen them.

705
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:27,440
They came for you?

706
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,039
Said they'll keep coming

707
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,960
as long as I'm there.

708
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:36,960
I know who they are.

709
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,480
Xun.

710
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,840
Are you in some kind of trouble?

711
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,039
Tell me.

712
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,159
We don't want to work for Bao.

713
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,784
They want to take over the Billiards,

714
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,159
and Cha didn't agree.

715
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,840
I've been worried they'd cause trouble.

716
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,840
I was wondering with Rat

717
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,400
why they didn't make a move.

718
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,039
So they came to you.

719
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,239
Those scumbags!

720
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,599
Xun! Xun!

721
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,239
Xun, calm down!

722
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,039
Calm down.

723
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,599
They're trying to provoke you with this.

724
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,000
Don't fall for it.

725
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,719
I can't put you in trouble.

726
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,440
I won't.

727
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,400
They don't dare to come to school.

728
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,599
If they dare,

729
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll call the police.

730
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,920
You finally get on the right track.

731
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,880
Don't ruin it because of me.

732
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,400
Promise me. Okay?

733
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,960
Promise me.

734
00:39:59,239 --> 00:39:59,960
Please.

735
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,719
Don't worry.

736
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,039
I won't act rashly.

737
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,000
From now on,

738
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,320
I go wherever you go.

739
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,980
I'll protect you.

740
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:17,960
Okay.

741
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:36,384
(Temporarily Closed)

742
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:41,840
Cha.

743
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,559
You're finally back.

744
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:49,960
Why are you here?

745
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,440
When we came,

746
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
we saw this sign.

747
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
The door was locked.

748
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,320
I was so worried about you,

749
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,119
so we waited here.

750
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,800
If you are in trouble,

751
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,519
we couldn't explain to Bao.

752
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,280
You're Bao's favorite buddies.

753
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,239
Perfect.

754
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:07,719
Tell Bao this when you go back.

755
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,840
I'm closing the Billiards.

756
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:11,639
You think you can just quit?

757
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
What do you mean?

758
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,400
Nothing.

759
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,239
It's Bao's decision to make.

760
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,360
Let's take it easy

761
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,480
and not push us too hard.

762
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,239
Cha, I'm just delivering messages.

763
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,599
Since you said so,

764
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,079
I'll tell Bao about it.

765
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,920
Cha.

766
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,079
You know Miss Tan pretty well, right?

767
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,280
What do you want?

768
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,159
Nothing.

769
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,320
Come on.

770
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,079
I just want to ask

771
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,920
if Miss Tan is single.

772
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,280
Bao has been

773
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:46,960
worried no one

774
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,840
likes Fat Dog.

775
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,320
Miss Tan is great.

776
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,960
Young, in good shape,

777
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,400
gentle,

778
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,039
and kind...

779
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,280
If you target her,

780
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,239
I'll kill you.

781
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,159
It doesn't matter,

782
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,840
but there are so many of us here.

783
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,079
You only have two eyes.

784
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Can you monitor us all?

785
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,519
Good.

786
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,039
We're buddies, right?

787
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,840
Don't stay so hot-headed.

788
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:35,920
Give me a hug.

789
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,639
Much better.

790
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,159
Go back.

791
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
We're going back.

792
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:48,920
Don't stay up late.

793
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:50,639
Let's go.

794
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,039
Exhausted.

795
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,039
What?

796
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,800
They went to the bookstore?

797
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:05,639
Right.

798
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,400
Ye Haitang can't
even work part-time now.

799
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,039
Do you think

800
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,440
they'll go to Zhenzhu

801
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,239
or Granny?

802
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,159
Cha,

803
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
if this continues,

804
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,519
Zhenzhu and Tang will both be in danger.

805
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,639
You think Tan Xin is safe?

806
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,159
They went to Miss Tan?

807
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,519
Those scumbags!

808
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,400
Cha.

809
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,440
We can't just sit here.

810
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,239
We have to do something.

811
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,159
Say something!

812
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
Can you be quiet?

813
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:39,960
I'll handle it.

814
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:42,400
Let me think.

815
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,239
Okay?

816
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,039
It's okay.

817
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,360
Don't worry. I come frequently.

818
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:51,519
I'll keep a close eye on it.

819
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,000
Good.

820
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
This can be sold for money.

821
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,039
What are you doing?

822
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,119
Who are you?

823
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,039
Who are you then?

824
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,000
Security.

825
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,119
Well,

826
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,199
we're scheduled

827
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,159
for demolition here next week.

828
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,280
We need to clear it out now.

829
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,480
No one informed you?

830
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,000
Quan. Quan.

831
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,039
Can you hear me?

832
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,559
Go find Sun Miaomiao now.

833
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,559
She has connections.

834
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,039
Anyway,

835
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,320
keep the mailbox for me, okay?

836
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,960
Any papers?

837
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:27,559
Our superiors didn't give us.

838
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,000
We require official papers.

839
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,360
It's the regulation.

840
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:45,504
(Yuetu 205)

841
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,400
Coming.

842
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,000
Who are you?

843
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,840
You're Tang Yixun's daughter?

844
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,280
Yes.

845
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,599
And you are?

846
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,840
Rat.

847
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:10,559
