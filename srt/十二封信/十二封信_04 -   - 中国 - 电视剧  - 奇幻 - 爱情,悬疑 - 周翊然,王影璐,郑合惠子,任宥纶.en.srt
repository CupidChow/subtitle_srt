Did you take my letter?

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,239
What letter?

9
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,640
A couple of days ago, I wrote

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
a letter to my future self too.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,479
And I put it in the mailbox.

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,920
But it's gone now when I checked.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
I didn't touch it.

14
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,920
You are in charge of the mailbox.

15
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,359
You got the lock and keys.

16
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,200
Why didn't I find my letter?

17
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,919
Maybe it was Hu.

18
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,840
He's always rummaging through things.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll ask him later.

You're too harsh on your own people.

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,120
I married a flighty wife,

70

and she ran off with another man,

71

74
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,839
and pulled a knife on me,

75

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,000
I worked to pay her tuition,

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,839
and pay her mother's debts.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,199
I also took you to the hospital.

82
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600

83

I won't let you off.

115

to go against me.

I'm done talking.

118
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,639
Give me the deed.

00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:26,919
Pay out.

195
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,759
Seven Dots.

196
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,879
Four Characters.

197
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,120
Stop overthinking. You'll never win.

198
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,879
Three Characters.

199
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,600
Come on. Let me win.

200
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,720
Hurry up! Come on.

201
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,560
Come on.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
I bet you can't win.

203
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,160
One Dot.

204
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,840
I call Pong!

205
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,919
Five Dots.

206
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't think about it.

207
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,159
Hurry up.

208
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,359
Nine Dots.

209
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Come on!

210
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,720
I'm going to win.

211
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,639
Three Dots.

212
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,240
You need the Six Bamboos.

213
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,120
What's wrong with you?

214
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,919
This guy is a terrible debtor.

215
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,519
You gamble with him?

216
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,639
How did you find me?

217
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,359
You've won a lot.

218
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,440
How about this?

219
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,879
My brother sent me to collect debts.

220
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,159
And I need to do something.

221
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,279
Not just my brother.

222
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,679
Bao is also looking for you.

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,919
Wait.

224
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,679
We agreed to wait

225
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,200
till my next month's paycheck.

226
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,639
I'll pay you then.

227
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,359
By the way,

228
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,519
you extorted a lot

229
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,320
from the principal, right?

230
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,320
That should cover your debts.

231
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Well,

232
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,759
I'll bring them here.

233
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,759
No need.

234
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
The school thing
was all a misunderstanding.

235
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,159
I wasn't targeting you.

236
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,279
Besides, I didn't win much.

237
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,760
Fine.

238
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,199
Ye Yibo,

239
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
listen to me.

240
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,680
From now on,

241
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,599
if you dare hurt Ye Haitang even once,

242
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,799
I'll make you suffer.

243
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,720
Win more.

244
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,920
I'm leaving.

245
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,559
Are you playing or not?

246
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,519
Hurry up.

247
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,680
You won some money today,

248
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,119
trying to run? Come on.

249
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,279
You won the most today.

250
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,039
Hurry up. It's your turn.

251
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,960
Hurry up.

252
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Just one tile away!

253
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,799
Who's this now?

254
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm just here to play mahjong.

255
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
You're Ye Yibo?

256
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,319
What's up, man?

257
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:14,680
Pay back the money!

258
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,439
Ye Haitang.

259
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,799
Thanks for yesterday.

260
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,160
I brought you steamed buns.

261
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,640
Still warm.

262
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,839
I don't eat steamed buns.

263
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,000
How's your leg?

264
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,119
It's fine.

265
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,160
It's pouring rain.

266
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,000
Go back and rest.

267
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,920
I also brought you this.

268
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,760
Antiseptic solution

269
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,639
for the inflammation.

270
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,800
Try it.

271
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,559
Did you call me yesterday?

272
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,039
I was busy yesterday

273
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,480
and missed your call.

274
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,159
But I promise

275
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,319
it won't happen again.

276
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,720
So what happened yesterday?

277
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,359
What I told you

278
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,920
stays between us.

279
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,320
Okay.

280
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,839
Before confronting Ye Yibo that day,

281
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,920
I wrote a letter.

282
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,799
Not exactly a letter.

283
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,119
Call it the last note.

284
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,279
And I put it

285
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,839
in the mailbox by the bookstore.

286
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,759
Then things got chaotic,

287
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,440
and I forgot about it.

288
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,720
Yesterday I wanted
to tear that letter up,

289
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,440
but I can't find it.

290
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,200
You don't want it anyway.

291
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,840
Just let it be.

292
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,720
But all other letters are here.

293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,880
Why is mine missing?

294
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,440
Maybe someone took it.

295
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:18,879
Impossible.

296
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,119
I asked the owner,

297
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,000
and he never touched that mailbox.

298
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,039
And I've kept the keys.

299
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:30,759
Don't you want others
seeing that letter?

300
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,000
I think something is wrong here.

301
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,119
The mailbox is locked.

302
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,720
Someone took my letter,

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,359
and put that love letter inside.

304
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,480
This is really suspicious.

305
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,240
How about this?

306
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,359
You'd go to school.

307
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,559
I'll wait for you there after school.

308
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,759
Let's figure out what's going on.

309
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Alright.

310
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm leaving.

311
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,560
Where is Tang Yixun?

312
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,359
He's not here.

313
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,279
Can he go back to school?

314
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,159
Of course.

315
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,640
I can't let him end up like me.

316
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,160
Li Chadong, you...

317
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Miss Tan, anything else?

318
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,039
Don't gossip about her.

319
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
She might...

320
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,799
Look at her now.

321
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,079
She needs no protection.

322
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,919
Move over there.

323
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,759
She needs no protection.

324
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,720
But

325
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,440
we should thank the school.

326
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,399
Because

327
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,079
lawbreakers must be severely punished.

328
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,840
Cha.

329
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,920
We're wrong.

330
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,160
Here got trashed.

331
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,039
And the boat money's gone too.

332
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,119
Don't talk about this.

333
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,319
Luckily, we are still alive.

334
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,639
Cha.

335
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,359
Don't worry.

336
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,119
We'll earn this money back for you.

337
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,920
It's all in the past.

338
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,039
But we can't swallow this injustice!

339
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:48,879
Rat.

340
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,080
It's in the past.

341
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Don't cause any more trouble, okay?

342
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't come here lately.

343
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,680
I need some peace.

344
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,119
Xun.

345
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,680
If you can still go back to school,

346
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,599
just go.

347
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,280
Enough.

348
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,520
Go home.

349
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Go home.

350
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,359
Tang Yixun.

351
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,039
Is this what you meant?

352
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,400
Someone dumped this mailbox here.

353
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
The owner just kept it

354
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
for our event.

355
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,400
Where will the letters inside

356
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
be mailed to?

357
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,519
The event is just to sell stationery.

358
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,880
They won't be mailed out.

359
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
So,

360
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,799
this thing is just for show.

361
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,680
The owner said that love letter

362
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,279
was found in this mailbox.

363
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,480
And my letter was in here too.

364
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
Then it disappeared.

365
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
It can't be opened.

366
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,759
Then someone must have

367
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,519
tampered with the letters inside.

368
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,599
Are you sure

369
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,599
it wasn't the owner?

370
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,160
Why would he?

371
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,559
Write me a love letter in your name?

372
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,319
Do you know each other?

373
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,359
No.

374
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,959
Then who did it?

375
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,519
What did he want?

376
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,839
Simple.

377
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,960
Someone wants to fool us.

378
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
I need to find a way

379
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,079
to expose this person.

380
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:58,240
(Sunshine Bookstore)

381
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,720
(To Ye Haitang)
Will sending an empty envelope work?

382
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't worry.

383
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,400
We're catching someone,

384
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,480
not mailing anything.

385
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,200

You don't like steamed buns,

492
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,840
so I bought this bread.

493
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,679
It should be sweet.

494
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,079
Try it.

00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:40,999

496
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,200
Right?

497
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,719
I saw many adults

498
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,039
buying this for their kids,

499
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,039
so I figured it must taste good.

500
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,880
Definitely better than buns.

501
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,719
Haven't you tried this?

502
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,239
I have.

503
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,840
This isn't filling,

504
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,079
so I don't like it.

505
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,240
You have it.

506

this letter was written with sincerity.

519
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400

also sells this stationery,

with an anchor in the top right.

522
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,159
This person bought stationery
from our store,

523
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,039
wrote a letter,

524
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,199
put it in the mailbox,

525
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,280
and took my letter.

526
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,239
He must have visited
the store many times.

527
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,159
Probably someone I know.

528
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,359
No way.

529
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,519
I must catch him.

I'm not.

536
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
I exercise every day,

537
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,920
and I'm in good shape.

538
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,039
I practice boxing.

539
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,239
Boxing?

540
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,079
Fighting, I bet.

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Yeah. Fighting.

542
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,920
Did you really come from
a reformatory school?

543
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,680
Yes.

544
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,239
I was sent there

545
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:08,919
because of fighting.

546
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,000
How did you get involved
with those people?

547
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,159
I grew up in a welfare institute.

548
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
When I was sixteen,

549
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,800
I left on my own.

550
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,440
I had no money

551
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,280
and no place to stay.

552
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,039
It's Cha who took me in.

553
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,960
I would've starved otherwise.

554
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,079
Is fighting the only way to survive?

555
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,599
No one likes fighting.

556
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,519
I hate it

557
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:55,159
when people punch my face.

558
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,119
You don't get it.

559
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,760
I do.

560
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,599
We've been staking out here for days.

561
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,360
I think that person won't come.

562
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,760
Let's drop this.

563
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,639
Go take a rest.

564
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,039
Come back to school after you heal.

565

Get a haircut too.

566

577
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,039
Are you cold? I've got

578
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,559
a new coat.

579
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,559
I'll go get it for you.

580
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,639
I haven't told anyone about the mailbox.

581
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,000
I've been protecting the scene.

582
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,440
I've kept our patrols

583
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,159
away from here.

584
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,320
Don't mention the patrols.

585
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,559
Tell him about the letter.

586
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,039
The letter is with you.

587
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,439
Were you here when the letter came?

588
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,439
He was.

589
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:43,999
I was.

590
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,079
I was here when her dad vanished.

591
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,320
It was at 12:00 AM.

592
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,000
An old man,

593
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,400
a cat,

594
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,880
and some paper

595
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,320
were making sounds.

596
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Anyway. The cat meowed,
and the paper rustled...

597
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,760
I can't explain it.

598
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,079
Suddenly,

599
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,200
he vanished.

600
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
So did the letter.

601
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,439
Vanished?

602
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:15,609
Has this mailbox always been here?

603
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,880
It's been here

604
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,480
these three months when I'm around.

605
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,760
Have other people
gone missing here before?

606
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,920
Bro, I'm not trying to scare you.

607
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,360
Over there is no man's land.

608
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,039
Have you seen a black hole?

609
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,119
Heard of the aurora?

610
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,679
How about aliens?

611
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,559
Zhang Quan, get to the point!

612
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,440
The point is people vanish every year...

613
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,239
Don't tell anyone about this.

614
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,760
This area is cursed.

615
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,760
Were you here when this letter came?

616
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,760
He was here.

617
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,920
Yes, with her.

618
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,119
Got it.

619
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,000
According to both of you,

620
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,599
this happened twice in total.

621
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,120
First, your dad mailed the letter.

622
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:05,599
And then he vanished.

623
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,320
Yes.

624
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,032
Second, there was
no letter in the mailbox,

625
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,159
but a letter appeared out of thin air.

626
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:12,480
So there's an invisible person

627
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,400
who took the letter

628
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,239
and put back a letter

629
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,119
from unknown in here.

630
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,760
Well said.

631
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,600
I guess so.

632
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,199
Bro, think about it.

633
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,000
What's this

634
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,239
invisible person? Not human at all.

635
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,079
You know?

636
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:25,679
Ridiculous.

637
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:27,880
You think I'll believe that?

638
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,280
It's impossible.

639
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,360
He's really stubborn.

640
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,000
Wait.

641
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,559
You...

642
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:33,719
I've wasted my time on you.

643
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,159
Why come here then?

644
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,320
Why?

645
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,640
Look!

646
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
- Cat!
- Look!

647
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,280
