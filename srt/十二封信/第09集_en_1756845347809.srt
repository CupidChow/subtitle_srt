(To Ye Haitang)

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Yu Nian.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,080
Thank you.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,960
You may leave.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,880
Is it from your dad?

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,670
(Tang Yixun)

7
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Is your dad named Tang Yixun?

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
How is it? Are you cold?

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,440
Help me up.

13
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I can't even stand up.

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm frozen stiff.

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,840
Frozen stiff?

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,960
You insisted on coming.

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,440
What if you catch a cold,

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,200
or get scared?

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,000
Indeed. I might catch a cold.

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
But I get scared?

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Impossible.

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,640
I've seen everything.

23
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,760
We've waited all night,

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
yet nothing comes

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
from the mailbox.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,200
What does Yu Nian mean?

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
What's the wrong with this mailbox?

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,960
So spooky.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Look.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
Nothing.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,280
It doesn't occur every night.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Depends on the situation.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Listen to me.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,040
You go back first.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,160
I'll keep watch for you.

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,800
I'll tell you once letters come.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,580
Then you come back.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
Well...

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
I'll go take a nap.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Message me anytime.

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,480
Give out
missing person notices tomorrow.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Three hundred.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Okay.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,640
Keep watch.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,240
A stray cat?

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
What's that noise?

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,040
It occurs.

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,360
I told you.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,760
Are you okay?

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Shen Cheng.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,240
We got a reply.

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,880
What does it mean?

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,370
(My kid, let's go to Shiqiao today.
For fish cakes.)

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,120
Are you sure

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
Yes.

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Which means

58
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
that must be Ye Haitang from 1991.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,480
Yes.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
My mom is still alive.

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
She lives in the year 1991 over there.

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,440
300 missing person notices

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,320
were all

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,360
posted up.

65
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,640
Exhausted.

66
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Listen up.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,920
When I came back,

68
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
that woman was still there.

69
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,120
Listen,

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
your friend

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
is really something.

72
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
She's pregnant,

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
but not fragile at all.

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Though she likes to brag,

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
claiming she's bold.

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,800
But when the letter came,

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,120
she passed out from fright.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,440
Passed out?

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,440
Is she okay?

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,240
Is the baby alright?

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,720
Yes. I took her to the hospital.

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,480
The doctor said...

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,040
Are you sure?

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,080
She just got scared. Okay.

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
The baby is fine.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,040
Are you crazy?

87
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
Why tell others about this matter?

88
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,840
What do you mean?

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,160
Aren't we in the same team?

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,240
Shen...

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,040
Shen Cheng!

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
What's wrong with him?

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,440
Why slammed the door?

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
Weren't you calling us

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
scammers?

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,640
Now you're worried about leaks?

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
How ridiculous!

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,640
Why slammed the door?

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
Where's your manners?

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,040
My mom says it would get bad luck!

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,760
Enough.

102
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,520
Mind your manners.

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
Don't blame him.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,520
What's wrong?

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,560
Is he your boss?

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,160
His mom's gone.

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,040
Where to?

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,240
She's passed away.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
Don't blame him.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,200
Dead?

111
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,640
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm really sorry.

113
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
I didn't know.

114
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,160
Why didn't you tell me?

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,200
I noticed he was acting different.

116
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Losing his mom must be heartbroken.

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Alright. Stop it.

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
Wait,

119
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
we just received a letter.

120
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,120
19 years old.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
That must be his mom.

122
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Cheng.

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't be sad.

124
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Come out.

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
She's still alive.

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,200
She's living in the other world.

127
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop it.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,720
Come out and discuss

129
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
how to reply the letter.

130
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,850
(Avoid him now.)

131
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,840
What does it mean?

132
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,200
(He'll put you in danger.)
He'll put you in danger?

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,960
Give me.

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,520
I'll write.

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
Give me the letter!

136
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,280
Shen Cheng!

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,760
What?

138
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,440
Shen Cheng, explain yourself!

139
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
That letter isn't just yours.

140
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,400
Calm down.

141
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Shen Cheng!

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,040
Careful.

143
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Stop!

144
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,160
Careful.

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Shen Cheng!

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Keep your voice down.

147
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,440
Ma'am.

148
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,680
Don't provoke him.

149
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,640
Let him write what he wants.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,240
Don't delay important matters.

151
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
(Police)

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,080
This is where you used to live.

153
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,360
Do you remember?

154
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,640
Yes.

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
I used to live here.

156
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
We went to investigate.

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,160
Some old neighbors

158
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
remember your current father.

159
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
He returned a year before you moved.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
A year before?

161
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,360
That's him, right?

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,680
That's my father when he was young.

163
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,360
His name is Tang Yixun.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
In 1991,

165
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,640
he was imprisoned for manslaughter.

166
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
Due to good behavior,

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
he was transferred to

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
Yu Zhiyong's prison for hit-and-run.

169
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
They became cellmates

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,200
and grew very close.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,040
Later, Yu Zhiyong

172
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,480
fell ill

173
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,800
and died in prison.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
I think he received

175
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
Yu Zhiyong's dying wish

176
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,400
to go to your hometown

177
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,520
and care for you and your grandma.

178
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,960
Just...

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,760
Just because of a dying wish?

180
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,800
This seems the most likely reason.

181
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,120
But first, we need to find him.

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,560
We found his identity.

183
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,680
That simplifies things.

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
We'll contact you

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
once we have updates.

186
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,480
Okay?

187
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,840
This mailbox stays,

188
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,160
while people come and go.

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,680
Everyone who sits here freezes up.

190
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,920
Bro.

191
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,600
Put this on.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800
You'll catch a cold.

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,960
Yu Nian told me everything.

194
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,920
Sorry to hear that.

195
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't know how to comfort you.

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,440
You must have

197
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,000
gone through a lot.

198
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,360
I won't ask further

199
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,680
to spare you more distress.

200
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
Go back soon.

201
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,840
It's freezing.

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,120
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

203
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,320
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

204
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Fairly well.

205
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,760
We interacted for months.

206
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
What kind of person is he?

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,400
He?

208
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,760
An old man.

209
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,160
An old folk.

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
He sat here every day.

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,440
Quite stubborn.

212
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,400
Just like you.

213
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
He brought me steamed buns twice.

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,040
I think

215
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,720
he's a good person.

216
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,440
It's freezing.

217
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,600
You should go back soon.

218
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,000
Bye-bye.

219
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,630
(Ye Haitang's personal information)

220
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,900
(Middle school, Dropout)

221
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,640
He sat by the mailbox all night.

222
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
Just sat there wide-eyed.

223
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
I worried he'd freeze.

224
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,600
How do you guys handle the cold so well?

225
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
I'll go check on him.

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
He doesn't let me reply now.

227
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,600
What if he gets a reply?

228
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,360
I'll join him.

229
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,680
Coming.

230
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,800
Coming.

231
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,880
You'll break the door.

232
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,680
Bro.

233
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,960
Got a reply?

234
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,400
Freezing cold?

235
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,160
Thank you.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,880
No problem.

237
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,520
Where to?

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
What happened?

239
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,800
Leaving now?

240
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
He just left?

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,080
How could he just leave?

242
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,840
Wait.

243
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,920
Where are you going?

244
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll follow him.

245
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,640
Police only tells him

246
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
about updates.

247
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,160
I need

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,200
to follow him.

249
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,400
He doesn't tell you?

250
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
He's immediate family.

251
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,880
I'm at a disadvantage now.

252
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,080
Inform Miaomiao for me.

253
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
I'm leaving Beixing to you.

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,540
Leave it to you, Quan.

255
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm leaving.

256
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,200
You got this!

257
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,760
Wait...

258
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,400
You...

259
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,520
Leave it to me?

260
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,040
Can I handle it?

261
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,840
Well...

262
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,280
Such a huge responsibility.

263
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
I'll handle it.

264
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,360
This time,

265
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
why did you come back?

266
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
I know your concerns.

267
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,520
I have one goal,

268
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
to find my dad.

269
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,880
If he's done something wrong,

270
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
I won't protect him.

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
My mom's resume shows

272
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,400
she quit senior year

273
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,540
and didn't take the college exam.

274
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll find people

275
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,640
who knew about this.

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,720
Which year?

277
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,810
The year Tang Yixun committed the crime.

278
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
Did you find anyone?

279
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,660
(Unknown caller)

280
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,440
Hello.

281
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,760
Hello.

282
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,280
Are you Ye Haitang's son?

283
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,760
This is Tan Xin.

284
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,080
Ye Haitang

285
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,800
was hindered by that case.

286
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Tang Yixun's case?

287
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
Ye Haitang was involved too?

288
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,440
The town had all kinds of rumors.

289
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Some said

290
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
Tang Yixun killed for Ye Haitang.

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Others claimed

292
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Ye Haitang did the killing,

293
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,400
and Tang Yixun took the blame for her.

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Anyway,

295
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,720
I'm certain

296
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,680
Tang Yixun

297
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,400
would never harm Ye Haitang.

298
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,240
Why are you so certain?

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
They were my students.

300
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
When Tang Yixun was in prison,

301
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,960
he wrote me a letter.

302
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,040
Said he couldn't burden
Ye Haitang anymore,

303
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,120
or tarnish her life further.

304
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
He begged me to help her
retake the twelfth grade.

305
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
Make sure she can get into college

306
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,840
and leave Meiwan safely.

307
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
After she got into college,

308
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,040
then we lost contact.

309
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,960
Well,

310
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
about that case,

311
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
do you recall any other details?

312
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,080
Time.

313
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,520
It should be

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
November,

315
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
around the end of the month,

316
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,000
30th.

317
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,560
Do you know the deceased's name?

318
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Someone mentioned his name.

319
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,360
But it sounded unfamiliar to me.

320
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,760
So I forgot over time.

321
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,800
My apologies.

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Don't mind it.

323
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,840
Please think carefully

324
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,000
if there is anyone else

325
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
who was close to them.

326
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,600
For example,

327
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
friends, family members,

328
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,400
or classmates from their class.

329
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,920
Anything.

330
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,560
Whatever works.

331
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,000
Xun

332
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,600
was an orphan.

333
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
He had a buddy named Zhang Hao
since childhood.

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,160
I saw him a few years ago.

335
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,160
Not sure if he's still in Pushui.

336
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,360
His contact...

337
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,800
Yes.

338
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,440
Do you have it?

339
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
Well, I need to look for it

340
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
when I get home.

341
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
I'll send it to you if found.

342
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,680
Great, thank you.

343
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
Thank you.

344
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,920
Grandma!

345
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,280
Grandma!

346
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Xixi.

347
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,720
Xixi is here.

348
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,920
You got a red flower award?

349
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,560
Look, Grandma.

350
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,040
Hello, you two.

351
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
Hello.

352
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,800
- Mom.
- Son.

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,920
This is my son.

354
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,600
Hello.

355
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Miss Tan,

356
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,680
sorry for taking up your time.

357
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,680
Thank you.

358
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Not at all.

359
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,440
Here's our address

360
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,640
and our contacts.

361
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,000
Right.

362
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
If you recall anything else

363
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,200
or find Zhang Hao's contacts,

364
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,360
please tell us.

365
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,600
Contact us anytime.

366
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,960
Okay.

367
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
- Anytime.
- Okay.

368
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,080
I will.

369
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,960
Thank you.

370
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,720
- Bye.
- Thanks.

371
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,240
Let's go, Xixi.

372
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's go.

373
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Now you know my dad isn't a bad person?

374
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

375
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,360
I want to know

376
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
what they went through back then

377
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,920
that they became like this.

378
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,800
If everything hadn't happened,

379
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
would it have been different?

380
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,600
(Ye Haitang.)

381
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,480
(I'm your son Shen Cheng.)

382
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,320
(I don't know
how to describe my feeling now,)

383
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
(or explain what's happening.)

384
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
(But please believe what I say.)

385
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,040
(In 2026,)

386
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,760
(something terrible happened.)

387
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,440
(I want to know in 1991,)

388
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
(if you are doing well.)

389
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,160
(Is there someone
named Tang Yixun around you?)

390
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
(Whatever your relationship is,)

391
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,680
(please)

392
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,120
(avoid him now.)

393
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
(He'll put you in danger.)

394
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,200
(Believe me, Mom.)

395
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
My son?

396
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,680
You have a son?

397
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,280
Why am I involved?

398
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Why must you avoid me?

399
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,480
Why did he say I'd put you in danger?

400
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
How is that possible?

401
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,760
What does it mean?

402
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
Wait, who is this person anyway?

403
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Why should we believe him?

404
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
He claims he's your son...

405
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
Your son's surname is Shen?

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
So his dad is also a Shen.

407
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,800
Who's his father then?

408
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,320
Shen Xiaojun?

409
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,960
Impossible.

410
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,400
You and Shen Xiaojun are at odds.

411
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,320
How is that possible?

412
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
Wait, where am I?

413
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
Am I dead?

414
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,760
Impossible.

415
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,360
If I had died,

416
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
I wouldn't write you a love letter.

417
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,560
They wouldn't write

418
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,520
to let you avoid me.

419
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,320
Wait.

420
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,400
Let's calm down.

421
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
The letter says

422
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,440
your son's surname is Shen, Shen Cheng.

423
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,280
Told you to avoid me,

424
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I'd put you in danger.

425
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,040
Why would we believe his words?

426
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,800
Didn't you say

427
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,880
only you and your mom knew that phrase?

428
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,480
Right.

429
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,200
Look, the handwriting matches.

430
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
So this was written by Shen Cheng.

431
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,920
But there's no way

432
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,880
anyone else knows this.

433
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,280
I didn't even tell my grandma.

434
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,320
Wait, does this mean

435
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Yu Nian is your mother?

436
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,200
My mom is Wu Fengying.

437
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,560
Wait, this is so confusing.

438
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,440
None of these names match up.

439
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
They mentioned someone earlier...

440
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,280
Yu Zhiyong.

441
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Who's this Yu Zhiyong?

442
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,040
No idea.

443
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
Then why did they

444
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,320
write these letters?

445
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
Told you to avoid me,

446
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,040
and I'd put you in danger?

447
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,600
What would happen

448
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,520
to us in 2026

449
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,240
has anything to do with us now?

450
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,480
Put this inside.

451
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,480
Tang.

452
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,080
Tang.

453
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,600
The test papers...

454
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,680
It's fine.

455
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
Just test papers. Let them be.

456
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,200
What's wrong?

457
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
This house

458
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,200
leaks every time it rains.

459
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,280
Xun.

460
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,480
It's okay. Really.

461
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,720
I'll rewrite them.

462
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
Tang.

463
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,880
Nothing.

465
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,080
It's no big deal.

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,080
I thought about it all night.

467
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
I must've done something wrong.

468
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,960
Nonsense.

469
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,760
Think about it.

470
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
If I did nothing wrong,

471
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,960
I'd be by your side

472
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
and they wouldn't make you leave me.

473
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,640
Don't overthink it.

474
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,840
We don't know what's happening.

475
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,520
Tang, I mean...

476
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
If one day,

477
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,480
I really put you in danger,

478
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,080
just run away if you can.

479
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Time apart is nothing.

480
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,480
If I'm alive,

481
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,680
I'll come find you.

482
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,080
You won't.

483
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
Once we figure this out,

484
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
we'll be safe.

485
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Let's tidy up first.

486
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,360
Tang.

487
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll get more tarp from the market.

488
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,880
I'll go with you.

489
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,840
The mailbox?

490
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Where's it?

491
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,880
Sir.

492
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,440
Sir.

493
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
Where's the mailbox?

494
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,480
Mailbox?

495
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,160
Isn't it there?

496
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
- It's gone.
- It's gone!

497
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,960
Probably washed away.

498
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,680
What?

499
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,040
Xun!

500
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,880
No, no!

501
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920
Kid, get back here!

502
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,000
Be careful. It's dangerous!

503
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,440
Xun, come up here!

504
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
Tang, don't get down!

505
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,960
Come up! Forget the mailbox!

506
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,840
Xun, come up now!

507
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,720
Xun, come up here!

508
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
- Come up!
- Xun!

509
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,800
Just let it be.

510
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,920
Why risk your life for it?

511
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,000
Tang.

512
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,360
Be careful, Xun.

513
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,600
Careful.

514
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,320
I'll go look for it.

515
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
It's raining heavily.

516
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
Don't go out.

517
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,200
I need to find that mailbox.

518
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,600
How can I reply without it?

519
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,880
Why did the mailbox

520
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,160
suddenly vanish?

521
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
It's raining heavily.

522
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,720
It's an accident.

523
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
But the mailbox vanished!

524
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,560
I have to ask them

525
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
why they told you to avoid me

526
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
and what dangers you might be in.

527
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,480
I know nothing!

528
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,280
Xun.

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
We can't figure out what happens

530
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,480
with just some words.

531
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,720
Let's go look for it tomorrow.

532
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,200
We won't be apart.

533
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,680
Never.

534
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Okay.

535
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,320
I'll look for it tomorrow.

536
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,000
Every day.

537
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,640
Meiwan is not that big.

538
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
I believe I can find it.

539
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,480
The Billiards is ready.

540
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,640
And Cha is back on his feet.

541
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,080
Why doesn't Bao

542
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,960
leave you alone?

543
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,880
What did Qiang tell you that day?

544
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,760
You still go collect debts for them?

545
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,080
As long as we don't work for them,

546
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,720
they can't control us.

547
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,000
Cha.

548
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
The rain's stopped.

549
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,800
Take Zhenzhu home.

550
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,920
Don't come over lately.

551
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,040
Tell Xun the same.

552
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,480
We're different from them.

553
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
We can still avoid them.

554
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,800
Go.

555
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,860
(Buddies Billiards)

556
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,360
Qiang, the door is locked.

557
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,960
No one's there.

558
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,840
This sign can only fool you.

559
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,920
You idiots.

560
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,630
(Temporarily Closed)

561
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,240
Fine.

562
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,760
Li Chadong.

563
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,840
Got guts.

564
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,680
Qiang.

565
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,200
They're trying to defy us.

566
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,960
Granny, I will restock for you later.

567
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,560
Alright.

568
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,680
Did Cha contact you?

569
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
What should we do?

570
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
Just listen to him.

571
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,600
Don't go over there lately.

572
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,440
If you see Qiang or Fat Dog,

573
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,600
avoid them.

574
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,560
Avoid them?

575
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,560
For how long?

576
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Shut down
both the Billiards and video parlor?

577
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,600
If we don't,

578
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,840
we'd just earn money for them.

579
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,240
Better do manual labor

580
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
than that,

581
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,680
right?

582
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,320
What a curse

583
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,560
to encounter those scumbags.

584
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,520
We can't even

585
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,160
get rid of them.

586
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,040
Get rid of them?

587
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
Just smashing them.

588
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Alright.

589
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,840
Xun.

590
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
You go back to school.

591
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
I'll help Zhenzhu and Granny

592
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
with the sweet soup shop.

593
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,800
Let's get busy.

594
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,040
Things will be okay soon.

595
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,240
Okay.

596
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,480
I hope it didn't hit you.

597
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,000
Hai.

598
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
Girl.

599
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,680
Tell Rat and the others

600
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,160
to be cautious.

601
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,080
Otherwise,

602
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
I don't know what's in these bottles

603
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,040
next time.

604
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,040
Reading?

605
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,760
What do you want?

606
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,240
Get out.

607
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Reading?

608
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,120
What do you want?

609
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,800
Take it easy.

610
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
Calm down, guys.

611
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,560
What's

612
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
going on here?

613
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,880
Sorry, sir.

614
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
We're friends with the cashier girl.

615
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,280
We came to buy books.

616
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,880
What's wrong?

617
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,920
Not welcoming me?

618
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm your friend?

619
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,600
I don't know you at all.

620
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,240
What?

621
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,600
We're your boyfriend's buddies!

622
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,280
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

623
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,760
Can't I buy books here?

624
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Is it against the law?

625
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,160
Come on.

626
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,480
Go ahead.

627
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,920
Tang! Tang!

628
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,960
Let go.

629
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,760
Let go.

630
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,000
Right.

631
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,560
Hey, here.

632
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,960
Buy some cigarettes.

633
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:48,920
Here.

634
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Here.

635
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,680
Here.

636
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,760
Bro, here.

637
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,120
Buy your buddies cigarettes.

638
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,680
Sorry.

639
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
She is new here.

640
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,240
Come over.

641
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,080
Come over.

642
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,680
Look, he's

643
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,080
really good at it.

644
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,160
Call the police?

645
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,200
Let me tell you.

646
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,160
I've got plenty of time.

647
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,640
I can play with you every day.

648
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,400
Look, are these books

649
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,680
interesting?

650
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,520
Get something more exciting.

651
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,160
Okay? Tell me.

652
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,760
Yes.

653
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,800
Say it.

654
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,320
Yes.

655
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,120
I can't hear you!

656
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Yes. Yes.

657
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,080
Good.

658
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,440
Call the police.

659
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,840
Buy books.

660
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,080
Fat Dog.

661
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,480
Let's go.

662
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
Like this one?

663
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,920
What are you staring at?

664
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
Want to get beaten?

665
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,840
Sir.

666
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,040
Don't believe them.

668
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,440
I truly don't know them.

669
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,920
You shouldn't mess

670
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,840
with them.

671
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,120
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,760
Tang.

673
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,120
It's a small bookstore.

674
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
My wife and Hu live here.

675
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,320
I-I believe you.

676
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,520
But I can't mess with them.

677
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,520
They are barbarians.

678
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,720
Well, listen.

679
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,600
I-I'll

680
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,640
give you this month's salary early.

681
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,200
Take all of it.

682
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,080
You...

683
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,360
Should...

684
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,680
Should...

685
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,640
Focus on your studies.

686
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,880
I'm sorry.

687
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,480
Thank you, sir.

688
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,520
Thanks for taking care of me.

689
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,840
Sorry for causing you trouble.

690
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,040
I'm leaving.

691
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Tang.

692
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
Why are you here?

693
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Aren't you working?

694
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,080
I just came back.

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,920
What's up?

696
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Xun, is something wrong
at the Billiards?

697
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,360
What do you mean?

698
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,320
Tang.

699
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,120
Did you hear some rumors?

700
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,280
Some punks caused trouble
at the bookstore today.

701
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,680
Punks?

702
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,240
Know their names?

703
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,920
I don't know.

704
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,920
Never seen them.

705
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,440
They came for you?

706
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,040
Said they'll keep coming

707
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,960
as long as I'm there.

708
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,960
I know who they are.

709
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,480
Xun.

710
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,840
Are you in some kind of trouble?

711
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,040
Tell me.

712
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,160
We don't want to work for Bao.

713
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,780
They want to take over the Billiards,

714
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
and Cha didn't agree.

715
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,840
I've been worried they'd cause trouble.

716
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,840
I was wondering with Rat

717
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,400
why they didn't make a move.

718
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,040
So they came to you.

719
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,240
Those scumbags!

720
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,600
Xun! Xun!

721
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,240
Xun, calm down!

722
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,040
Calm down.

723
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,600
They're trying to provoke you with this.

724
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't fall for it.

725
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,720
I can't put you in trouble.

726
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,440
I won't.

727
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,400
They don't dare to come to school.

728
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,600
If they dare,

729
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
I'll call the police.

730
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,920
You finally get on the right track.

731
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,880
Don't ruin it because of me.

732
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,400
Promise me. Okay?

733
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,960
Promise me.

734
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,960
Please.

735
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Don't worry.

736
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I won't act rashly.

737
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,000
From now on,

738
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,320
I go wherever you go.

739
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,980
I'll protect you.

740
00:39:59,240 --> 00:39:59,960
Okay.

741
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,380
(Temporarily Closed)

742
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,840
Cha.

743
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,560
You're finally back.

744
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:31,960
Why are you here?

745
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,440
When we came,

746
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,840
we saw this sign.

747
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,800
The door was locked.

748
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,320
I was so worried about you,

749
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,120
so we waited here.

750
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
If you are in trouble,

751
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,520
we couldn't explain to Bao.

752
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,280
You're Bao's favorite buddies.

753
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,240
Perfect.

754
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,720
Tell Bao this when you go back.

755
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,840
I'm closing the Billiards.

756
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,640
You think you can just quit?

757
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
What do you mean?

758
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,400
Nothing.

759
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
It's Bao's decision to make.

760
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Let's take it easy

761
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,480
and not push us too hard.

762
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,240
Cha, I'm just delivering messages.

763
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,600
Since you said so,

764
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,080
I'll tell Bao about it.

765
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,920
Cha.

766
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,080
You know Miss Tan pretty well, right?

767
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,280
What do you want?

768
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,160
Nothing.

769
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,320
Come on.

770
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
I just want to ask

771
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,920
if Miss Tan is single.

772
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,280
Bao has been

773
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,960
worried no one

774
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,840
likes Fat Dog.

775
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,320
Miss Tan is great.

776
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Young, in good shape,

777
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
gentle,

778
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,040
and kind...

779
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,280
If you target her,

780
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,240
I'll kill you.

781
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,160
It doesn't matter,

782
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,840
but there are so many of us here.

783
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,080
You only have two eyes.

784
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Can you monitor us all?

785
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,520
Good.

786
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,040
We're buddies, right?

787
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,840
Don't stay so hot-headed.

788
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,920
Give me a hug.

789
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,640
Much better.

790
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,160
Go back.

791
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,400
We're going back.

792
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,920
Don't stay up late.

793
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,640
Let's go.

794
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,040
Exhausted.

795
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,040
What?

796
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,800
They went to the bookstore?

797
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,640
Right.

798
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,400
Ye Haitang can't
even work part-time now.

799
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,040
Do you think

800
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,440
they'll go to Zhenzhu

801
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,240
or Granny?

802
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,160
Cha,

803
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
if this continues,

804
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,520
Zhenzhu and Tang will both be in danger.

805
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,640
You think Tan Xin is safe?

806
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
They went to Miss Tan?

807
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Those scumbags!

808
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,400
Cha.

809
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,440
We can't just sit here.

810
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,240
We have to do something.

811
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,160
Say something!

812
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
Can you be quiet?

813
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,960
I'll handle it.

814
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,400
Let me think.

815
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,240
Okay?

816
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,040
It's okay.

817
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,360
Don't worry. I come frequently.

818
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,520
I'll keep a close eye on it.

819
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,000
Good.

820
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,280
This can be sold for money.

821
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,040
What are you doing?

822
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,120
Who are you?

823
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,040
Who are you then?

824
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,000
Security.

825
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,120
Well,

826
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,200
we're scheduled

827
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
for demolition here next week.

828
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,280
We need to clear it out now.

829
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,480
No one informed you?

830
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,000
Quan. Quan.

831
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,040
Can you hear me?

832
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,560
Go find Sun Miaomiao now.

833
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,560
She has connections.

834
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,040
Anyway,

835
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,320
keep the mailbox for me, okay?

836
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:05,960
Any papers?

837
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,560
Our superiors didn't give us.

838
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,000
We require official papers.

839
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,360
It's the regulation.

840
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,500
(Yuetu 205)

841
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,400
Coming.

842
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,000
Who are you?

843
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,840
You're Tang Yixun's daughter?

844
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,280
Yes.

845
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,600
And you are?

846
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,840
Rat.

847
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,560
