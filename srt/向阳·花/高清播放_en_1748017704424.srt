23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
How many children did you sell?

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I sold it.

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Look at me.

26
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,160
Do you have children?

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Yes.

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Then you're not afraid of being exposed.

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,520
Wait.

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520

37
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,840

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,080
I know a little bit.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,240
I want to tell her

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,840
that I can help you draw.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
Stand up.

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560

How did you know Yu Lei?

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,640
My daughter is old.

46
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,720
She has a high fever.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,280
Her ears are swollen.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,760
I've learned a bit about her.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Ask her.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
She knows the word.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
Mo Guiqin, stand up.

52
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280

Mo Guiqin.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
You're from the same team.

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
You're on the 9th.

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,760
Or else,

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,440
you'll know the rules of the uniform.

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
If you don't know the rules,

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
you'll be punished.

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Do you hear me?

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm not a criminal.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
I'm not a criminal.

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm a criminal.

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm not a criminal.

73
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360

75
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Tell her.

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
What did she say?

77
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
The police.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
She said she knew.

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
All rise.

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Yes.

81
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,160
All the captains, stand up.

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Take your back and belongings with you.

90
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Follow me.

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080

92
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Zhu Xiujun.

93
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Here.

94
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Wang Shuang.

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Sun Xiaolan.

96
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Take your back and belongings with you.

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Follow me.

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Yes.

99
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Zhou Wenli.

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Zhang Tinglin.

101
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Tinglin.

102
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Take your back and belongings with you.

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Follow me.

104
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
These two are the upper and the lower.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
These are the lower and the lower.

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
You three go to sleep.

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Look at me.

108
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Look at me.

109
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I won't take my back.

110
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
All the criminal's back.

111
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
You have to pay all the charges within three days.

112
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Come up here.

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm the rule of the room 9.

114
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I'm the most annoying.

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
If you guys want to fight,

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
you have to hear me fight.

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Then you can sleep.

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Yes.

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Do you understand?

120
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Yes.

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
You can give these rules to him.

122
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
You little...

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
What did you say?

124
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
He said he's a little boy.

125
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
These three are the final judges.

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Thank you, Sun Xiaolan.

127
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Sit down.

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,920
Oh, you could have hit me!

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
What are you doing?

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,440
How dare you call me ''lamp!''

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
That way, girls through!

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,860
labeled in Varอง,錦官 projectile

134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,720
Who plays the P novellar

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Shoot!

136
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,480
dobrant appears

137
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Haven't noticed

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,620
Many have ridden

139
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Yes.

140
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Which one is the first to move?

141
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Meika, please say it.

142
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Officer, it's her.

143
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Mo Gui Qin, you're not a ghost.

144
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
You're the first one to move.

145
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
You think the rice is fragrant?

146
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Hu Bin, send a team to U4 with her.

147
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Yes.

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
And also a team to escort her.

149
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
Yes.

150
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Mo Gui Qin.

151
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Yes.

152
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Let's go.

153
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Which one is the first to move?

154
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,620
They're both.

155
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,620
Gao Yuexiang and Ma Amei.

156
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
Stand up.

157
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
Yes.

158
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,620
What did she say?

159
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,620
She's the one.

160
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
You're the first one to move.

161
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Gao Yuexiang and Ma Amei.

162
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Stand up.

163
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Yes.

164
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
I asked you to ask the police.

165
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
I asked you to ask the police.

166
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,620
I asked you to ask the police.

167
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,620
I asked you to ask the police.

168
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
This is Mo Gui Qin's first move.

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
It's none of your business.

170
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,620
You're not allowed to do it again.

171
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Give me a check-up tomorrow.

172
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Yes.

173
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
Let me introduce you.

174
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm Dong Hong.

175
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm your manager.

176
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
We both know each other better.

177
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Gao Yuexiang.

178
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
I want to talk about your situation.

179
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
The second half of the ninth day is in Gao Yuexiang.

180
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
I'm 28 years old.

181
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
I'm married.

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,620
I'm a member of the group.

183
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm married for two months a week.

184
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm a member of the group.

185
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
It's your Internet.

186
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
Yes.

187
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
You're married.

188
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
You have children.

189
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,620
You don't have a good life.

190
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Why do you come out and do this?

191
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Tell me.

192
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
What do you think?

193
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
I'm making money.

194
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
I...

195
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I want to give my daughter a job.

196
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
How much do you want to give her?

197
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
200,000 yuan.

198
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
What does your husband do?

199
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
My husband is a dog.

200
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,620
He doesn't do anything.

201
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
You don't have a good look.

202
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
What's wrong with you?

203
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
My brother has a family.

204
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,620
My husband's sister married my brother.

205
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
We have a family.

206
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
I married my dog's husband.

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
It sounds complicated.

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
I want to make money by myself.

209
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
I want to give my daughter a job.

210
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
I don't want her to be a mute for the rest of her life.

211
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
I didn't know how to make money.

212
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,620
I found a job in the Internet.

213
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
I have a man.

214
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,620
My husband said he could make money with me.

215
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
I left with him.

216
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
He locked you in the kitchen.

217
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,620
He made money.

218
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Is he a man?

219
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
He's not bad.

220
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,620
He always brings me a cup of tea.

221
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
He said he loves me.

222
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
The first 20,000 yuan I earned in my life

223
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
was given by him.

224
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
He loves you.

225
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
He can do this to you.

226
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,620
20,000 yuan is for you to sell your body.

227
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,620
He even asked him to leave.

228
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
I'll tell you the truth.

229
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,620
My sister, 18 years old,

230
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
she was a thief.

231
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,620
She was two years old and four months old.

232
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
They taught me the name.

233
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
They called her Black Sister.

234
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
That's what it means.

235
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
I forgot.

236
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
What did you steal?

237
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
I know dancing.

238
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
What?

239
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm a dancer.

240
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
What's the place?

241
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Who did you steal?

242
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
What's the specialty?

243
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Wait.

244
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,620
It's the last one.

245
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
I'll count to three.

246
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,620
Three.

247
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
Four.

248
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Five.

249
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
Ten.

250
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
Ten.

251
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Eight.

252
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,640
Back to pack your bags,

253
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,340
Cart case!

254
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,740
Go clippies!

255
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Student Chats pay back the rents

256
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,680
Among 12 criminal murderers

257
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,000
Set up Xiangyang شao shangjo

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,220
During the march,

259
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,520
Haohui Shrine

260
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,620
will have a joint square

261
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,540
on Cloud真秋

262
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,120
and a larger part,

263
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,980
including the one you occupied

264
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,820
God!

265
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,580
Potっ!

266
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,220
The raccoons who host us

267
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,620
will pay back the rents

268
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,700
The distribution shifts

269
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,980
You are still the leader.

270
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,860
Yes.

271
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,020
You must cherish this opportunity.

272
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,740
You must perform well and practice seriously.

273
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,220
You must perform well and get a bonus.

274
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
Do you hear me?

275
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Yes.

276
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,660
This is Mr. Ma from the Culture Museum.

277
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,860
I specially invited you to practice.

278
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,460
Everyone, welcome.

279
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,180
Mr. Ma, what are you practicing?

280
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,140
Everyone will sing the song, right?

281
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,460
Yes.

282
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,100
Mr. Ma, he is a mute.

283
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,980
I can't sing.

284
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,020
Hu Yun, you are too old.

285
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,100
What is the shape of your small show?

286
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,140
This show is a performance.

287
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,300
The lyrics need to be used in the dance.

288
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
The lyrics are so smart.

289
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,820
Next, I will show you the song.

290
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,980
Yuan Hui, wait.

291
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,660
You move.

292
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Yes.

293
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Everyone, take your right hand out and learn the moves with me.

294
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,180
I...

295
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,580
I...

296
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,100
I...

297
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,340
I...

298
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,940
I...

299
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,700
Let's connect the moves.

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,940
Everyone, sing together.

301
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,900
I...

302
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,420
I...

303
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,540
Mr. Ma, I'm sorry.

304
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,940
I have to interrupt.

305
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,820
Gao Yixiang, what are you telling me?

306
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,620
Let him learn the moves.

307
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,060
When Mr. Ma is not around,

308
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,420
you two should practice together.

309
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,300
Listen, you two are a mutual group.

310
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,620
If he doesn't learn the moves,

311
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,460
you two will work together.

312
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,580
Do you hear me?

313
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,660
Yes.

314
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,500
Change.

315
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,940
I...

316
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,020
I...

317
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,380
Can't hear.

318
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,340
I understood it all.

319
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,340
to let them stand in front of the queue.

320
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,340
I come from the river,

321
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,340
where do I come from?

322
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Director, your singing is so good.

323
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
It looks like you're good at singing.

324
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,340
I have a home,

325
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,340
and I can sing in the morning.

326
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
I know, right?

327
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm here for the exam.

328
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm here to give the river and the river to Huang Feilong.

329
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,340
I'll give you a few thousand dollars a year.

330
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,340
It's the biggest deal between us.

331
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,340
You're so generous.

332
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,340
I'm not the only daughter of the rich.

333
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
I'm a rich man.

334
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
I'm a rich man.

335
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
I don't give money.

336
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
You've made me stupid.

337
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Take a guess!

338
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,340
Watch out for yourself.

339
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,340
Got married and got married.

340
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
This is not good for ourBig VO whether we live or die.

341
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
I can't move.

342
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
Director, see now I give you limits!

343
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
See for yourself!

344
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
What you got?

345
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
You're the best you can get.

346
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll go ask a lawyer.

347
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Here you are.

348
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Woke,

349
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Why do you have so many questions?

350
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
You don't know how to do this.

351
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
The rules on the sword,

352
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
drink the winter,

353
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
and return the old man.

354
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
This is an old man's game.

355
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
He'll give you two thousand dollars a year.

356
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,340
This is his business, right?

357
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,340
It's not his business.

358
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
It's for the sake of the three of you.

359
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,340
If you're satisfied,

360
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
you have to work with them.

361
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,340
White Fox,

362
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,340
you and Yaba also want to

363
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
give the group a little treat.

364
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
I'm a businesswoman.

365
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,340
I don't have money.

366
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,340
He has money.

367
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
He's in the guitar business.

368
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,340
We two are the ones who are going to pay for it.

369
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
Hello, Mr. Huang.

370
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Give me the money for this month.

371
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Hurry up.

372
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
Hello, Mr. Huang.

373
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
I'll pay for it right away.

374
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Feng Binbin.

375
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
What are you selling?

376
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
I'm selling the kitchen.

377
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm selling the kitchen.

378
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
This is the kitchen.

379
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
I haven't even started yet.

380
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,340
Yes.

381
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
istiKiet,

382
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
come here.

383
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Eat up.

384
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
are you hungry?

385
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
No.

386
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:22,960
Well.

387
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
It sure is Home Princessies.

388
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,220
You are the champion.

389
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,720
Let's give him a big hand.

390
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Thank you.

391
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Thank you.

392
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Wang Qiang, are you feeling unwell?

393
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm in a dizziness.

394
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I hope you can give me a good massage.

395
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Excuse me.

396
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Come in.

397
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
You look good.

398
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Thank you, Officer Dong.

399
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm going back.

400
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Yes.

401
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
How are you?

402
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm fine.

403
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
What's wrong?

405
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Nothing.

406
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
What's wrong?

407
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Nothing.

408
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm fine.

409
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
What's wrong?

410
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
You look beautiful.

411
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
What's wrong?

412
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
You look so good.

413
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm going to get you a massage.

414
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
You look so good.

415
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'm going to get you a massage.

416
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
He's not going to help you.

417
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
I'll help you.

418
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You're not going to let me help you?

419
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
You're still a man.

420
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
No, you're not going to help me.

421
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Don't go.

422
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
I'm going to get you a drink.

423
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Come on.

424
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Stop!

425
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Stop!

426
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Stop!

427
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Stop!

428
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Stop!

429
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Stop!

430
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Stop!

431
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm a man.

432
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm a man who's been kidnapped.

433
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm a man who's been kidnapped.

434
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Boss, I'm here.

435
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm here to see you.

436
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Stop!

437
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Stop!

438
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Stop!

439
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Stop!

440
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Stop!

441
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Stop!

442
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Stop!

443
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Stop!

444
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Stop!

445
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Stop!

446
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
Stop!

447
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Stop!

448
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Stop!

449
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Stop!

450
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
You guys have to get the hell out of here.

451
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
The lock is going to fall.

452
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
kicked.

453
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
You can talk.

454
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I bring the information as I.

455
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I send them my regards.

456
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
orns about to show up.

457
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Then,

458
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm not sure if I can get a job or not.

459
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

460
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

461
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

462
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

463
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

464
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

465
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

466
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

467
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

468
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

469
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

470
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

471
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm just a little bit worried.

472
00:26:44,720 --> 00:27:11,220
The пр 겨绪

473
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,220
If anyone sees my weakness

474
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,220
What am I to do?

475
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,220
What am I to do?

476
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,220
Who is in the next corner?

477
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,220
The earth is broken

478
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
I can't do anything

479
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,220
I can't do anything

480
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,220
They are in the corner. They will be in danger

481
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
What are you doing?

482
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
No, don't hit them

483
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Stop

484
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,220
I'm going to blow them up

485
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Gao Xia, stand up

486
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Don't move

487
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,220
I'll beat you up

488
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Yes

489
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Comrades, we are going to be strict with the criminals who have been threatened

490
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,220
We are going to be strict with the criminals who have been threatened

491
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,220
On the other hand, we are going to make it clear

492
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
They reject the idea of reformation

493
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
Understand the right to their emotions

494
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,220
For example, the high-level incense in the hotel area

495
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
It's a performance that is played again

496
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,220
Can't be ignored

497
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Be careful, be patient

498
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
And live far away

499
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
The punishment is not the purpose

500
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
The purpose is to change

501
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Help them to return to their original form

502
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Every criminal who has been threatened from our side

503
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,220
If you don't know your crime

504
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,220
And cause harm to the society and the family

505
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Then our job of reformation is not right

506
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Officer Liu, right?

507
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,220
Yes

508
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm the manager of the high-level incense, Deng Hong

509
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Hello

510
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Wait

511
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
Look inside

512
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
We are going to be strict with the criminals who have been threatened from our side

513
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Come, let's go

514
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Stand up, security guard

515
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
I'm a police officer.

516
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Your wife is a police officer.

517
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
I'm a housekeeper.

518
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
I'll check your house.

519
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,220
I'll ask Gao Yixiang to check on the child.

520
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Who's a ghost?

521
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,220
You're always crying.

522
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
You're always crying.

523
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,220
You're always crying.

524
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
You're always crying.

525
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
You're always crying.

526
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Don't put your hand on the door.

527
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Where's the child?

528
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,220
I don't see it.

529
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
You don't see it?

530
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
I don't see it.

531
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
You're a burglar.

532
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
You're a burglar.

533
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
You're worse than I thought.

534
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Why don't you call the police?

535
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Why don't you call the police?

536
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
When did you lose it?

537
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Where did you lose it?

538
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
Call the police.

539
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
I've seen a lot of children.

540
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Who did you find?

541
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I'm telling you.

542
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Yixiang is a criminal.

543
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
You're a criminal.

544
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
I'll catch you.

545
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm not a criminal.

546
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm a burglar.

547
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
How can I be a criminal?

548
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,220
Go to the police station with me.

549
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm not going.

550
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Go.

551
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
What's the matter?

552
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
Just eat.

553
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
You're really a criminal.

554
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Go.

555
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Let me ask you.

556
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
You think he lost his child?

557
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
How is Bao Gen usually?

558
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Did he say where he lost his child?

559
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,220
He lost his son.

560
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
He's a good boy.

561
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
He always wants to throw away his toy.

562
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
What about his relationship?

563
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
I don't know.

564
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
He's a boy.

565
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
He's a girl.

566
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
He's a boy.

567
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
He's a big boy.

568
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Officer Liu.

569
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,220
He told me about his relationship.

570
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
His daughter is abandoned.

571
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
He threw her away at the police station.

572
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,220
He saw someone passing by

573
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
and took her daughter to the police station.

574
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Which police station?

575
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Hello, Yixiang.

576
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
I'm Dong Hong.

577
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Hello.

578
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Come on.

579
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
Come on.

580
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Mommy.

581
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
You're not a good boy.

582
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Mommy, I'm a good boy.

583
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Are you going to be a little busy?

584
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
Mommy.

585
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,220
Mommy.

586
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
You've been awake for so many days.

587
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Did you get sick?

588
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Yes.

589
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Have you called your family?

590
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I've called them.

591
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
They probably think I'm dirty.

592
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
I'm going to change my clothes.

593
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
I'm going out to pick up my mother.

594
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
I'm going to do that.

595
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,220
I will.

596
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
I'm going to get rid of the money.

597
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
Come out.

598
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Xiao Li, wake up.

599
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Yes.

600
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Be quiet, auntie Yi.

601
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
Okay.

602
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,220
Be quiet, auntie Yi.

603
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,220
We're going to have a little rain.

604
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
I'm going to pick up my mother.

605
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,220
I'm going to go to the police station.

606
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
Come on.

607
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,220
Keep up.

608
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,220
You're getting tired from practicing singing,

609
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,040
don't you?

610
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,620
Today is my birthday.

611
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,180
I'm off work.

612
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,380
I can't go home to have dinner with my dad.

613
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,540
I'm a special leader.

614
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,940
I've made a noodles for you.

615
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,860
You can have dinner with me.

616
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,820
Even if you can't celebrate my birthday.

617
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,380
Happy birthday to you.

618
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,140
Happy birthday.

619
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,780
Thank you.

620
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,420
Happy birthday.

621
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,940
Thank you.

622
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,060
Grandpa is so pretty.

623
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,260
Han, the noodles are here.

624
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,980
They're here.

625
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,820
They're here.

626
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,460
Here, share the noodles.

627
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,140
Yes.

628
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,460
Each person has a box.

629
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,900
Thank you, sir.

630
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,300
It smells so good.

631
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,140
It's so delicious.

632
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,340
I can wish you a good trip.

633
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,460
I've put more sesame oil.

634
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,100

636
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,140
Bye.

637
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,780

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,260

639
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Happy birthday to you.

640
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,460
This is your payment.

641
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,260
The bill is full.

642
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,900
The water is full.

643
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,620
The money is not used.

644
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,580
The people are in the new wave.

645
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,820
You can click it.

646
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,780
This is your phone.

647
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,140
Your number should have been stopped long ago.

648
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,900
It's not used.

649
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,940
I've moved you a phone card.

650
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,220
It's 200 yuan.

651
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,020
Save it for a few months.

652
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,420
Thank you, director.

653
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,420
Go out and do your work.

654
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,180
Don't be so annoying.

655
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,260
I'll eat.

656
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,940
No, I'm sorry.

657
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,340
I'll leave then.

658
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,180
smoking

659
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,220
Hey,

660
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,620
you're in trouble in such good weather.

661
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,620
You are being abandoned by your husband.

662
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
Abandoned? Don't be impulsive.

663
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
The child is in the mansion.

664
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
I'll go and visit him once for you.

665
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
The child is still in the family.

666
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
He has a little companion.

667
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
I'll help you get his photo.

668
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
This brother is not human.

669
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
He is a born-in-law.

670
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
I'll kill him!

671
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
What are you saying?

672
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,620
You just left the prison and said such a ridiculous thing.

673
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
You've been a fool for two years.

674
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
You killed him.

675
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
You want to work hard and earn money,

676
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
and make the child a human.

677
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
That's your business.

678
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,620
I'll kill you.

679
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
You've been a man for a long time.

680
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,620
You can't get the child if you're a man like him.

681
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
You have to get the child.

682
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,620
The address of the welfare court

683
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
and my number are all in the photo.

684
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,620
There are two kinds of jobs in the world.

685
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,620
One is medical.

686
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
And the other is our job.

687
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Let's go.

688
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,620
I'll pick up the child.

689
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,620
You go.

690
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
I'll pick up the child.

691
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620

00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,620
I'm sorry.

759
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,620
I'm sorry.

760
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,620
Let's go.

761
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,620
Wait.

762
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,620
I'll get you.

763
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,620
Don't go.

764
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
Do you want to go?

765
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,620
I'm not going.

766
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,620
No. I can't go.

767
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,620
Let's go.

768
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,620
I'm going to buy a new one.

769
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,620
I'm going to buy a new one.

770
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,500
You should have more leisure time tonight.

771
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,300
I'll go and wash the cakes first.

772
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,620
比較好玩

773
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,960
Okay come on.

774
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,540
Pull this brooch Morgen

775
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,240
Here.

776
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,680
Wendy...

777
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,200
Now what?

778
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,440
It's the end.

779
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,880
Try to get out of town sometime.

780
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
Come here.

781
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm going to kill you.

782
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
How did you get in?

783
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Take this as a hotel.

784
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,240
You don't know how to drive, do you?

785
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,240
I'm going to fly with him.

786
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,240
You're a bad girl.

787
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,240
You've been driving for two years and four months.

788
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
You're going to wake up early and get ready for the rain.

789
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
You got it all wrong yesterday.

790
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,240
You stole the money, didn't you?

791
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Are we going to pay for it or are you going to call me Zhu Shufei?

792
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
You're a fool.

793
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
You're a hard worker.

794
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,240
Go on, go on.

795
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Go on.

796
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,240
Go on.

797
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Manager, you're here.

798
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Did you clean the room?

799
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,240
Yes.

800
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
Did you see the watch?

801
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
No.

802
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
No way.

803
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,240
I didn't put it on the bedside table.

804
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
I didn't put it on the washing table.

805
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,240
I'll call the police.

806
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
Don't worry.

807
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
I'll get this thing done.

808
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,240
What's this?

809
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,240
What's this?

810
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
The criminal is a criminal.

811
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
You've been stealing the money.

812
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
No wonder.

813
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
The teacher is here.

814
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
Where did you put the money?

815
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,240
You're still here.

816
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,240
You said you were going to fire me.

817
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
I didn't steal it.

818
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
I want to ask you to take it.

819
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
I'm going to take it.

820
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
I'm going to take it.

821
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,240
I'm going to take it.

822
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,240
I'm going to take it.

823
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
I want to ask you to take it.

824
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
You take it.

825
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
We're going to be in trouble.

826
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,240
Why should I be in trouble?

827
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
You're all alive.

828
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,240
I don't believe you.

829
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
I'm just looking for it.

830
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
What if I don't have it?

831
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
Are you guilty?

832
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,240
I'll take it.

833
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
Hello.

834
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Manager Shen, you can't find it on the watch.

835
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Yes.

836
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
It's a real house.

837
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,240
I've got a message.

838
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,240
You're mistaken.

839
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,240
It's on me.

840
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,240
I said...

841
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
I said where I'm going.

842
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
I went to the beach last night.

843
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
I was going to the beach last night.

844
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
You forgot your watch.

845
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,240
I thought it was in the hotel.

846
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Okay, I'll take it.

847
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Sorry.

848
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
I've made a mistake.

849
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,240
I can't find it.

850
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
It's better to find it earlier.

851
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
We can't even wash the hair.

852
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
It's my fault.

853
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
Here, take it.

854
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,240
This is your fault.

855
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
But you have money.

856
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,240
We don't dare to take it.

857
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
This gentleman, please wait.

858
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Bai Kang.

859
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Sorry.

860
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
I'm sorry.

861
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
I'm sorry for taking the money.

862
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,240
I'm sorry.

863
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
You're back.

864
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,240
Here.

865
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
Here.

866
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
I'm sorry.

867
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
I'm sorry.

868
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,240
I'm sorry.

869
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Here.

870
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
I'm a ghost.

871
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,240
I'm on the street.

872
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,240
I'm on the bus.

873
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,240
I'm a ghost.

874
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
I'm a ghost.

875
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
A buddyays an ass ;)

876
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:05,240
It's

877
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,800
Houseḍ Exacto

878
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,160
Dad

879
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,800
Get the documents straight

880
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,160
I want Registration

881
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
So what?

882
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
You don't have to go there.

883
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
I'll take care of it.

884
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,240
Okay.

885
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,240
I'll wait for you.

886
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Okay.

887
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
I'll be back.

888
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,240
Okay.

889
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,240
Bye.

890
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,240
Bye.

891
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,240
Bye.

892
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Bye.

893
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
Bye.

894
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
Bye.

895
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Bye.

896
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Bye.

897
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
Bye.

898
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,240
Bye.

899
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Bye.

900
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Bye.

901
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,240
Bye.

902
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Bye.

903
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,240
Bye.

904
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,240
Bye.

905
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,240
Bye.

906
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Bye.

907
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,240
Bye.

908
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,240
Bye.

909
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,240
What did she ask for?

910
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,240
She's a cosmetic designer.

911
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
She's been like this for two hours.

912
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,240
But she's not as good as a cosmetic designer.

913
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
I'm not that strict.

914
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
She's just like this.

915
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,240
You have a lot of money.

916
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,240
You can do a test on your face.

917
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,240
One time, one hundred, four hundred and three times.

918
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,240
How can you give her that?

919
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,240
This money is not enough for one drug.

920
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
I'll give you some medicine.

921
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Doctor.

922
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,240
You're a good doctor.

923
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,240
We're willing to do that.

924
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,240
If you can't make money,

925
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Aunt Aunt will come next month.

926
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,240
You can give me a medical certificate.

927
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Father and mother.

928
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,240
I'll give her the money.

929
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
I'll give her the money.

930
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,240
I'll give her the money.

931
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
The police.

932
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
The gun.

933
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,240
I'll give her the money.

934
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
I'll give her the money.

935
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,240
Don't be so sad.

936
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,240
She's just kidding.

937
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Everyone, be careful.

938
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Don't let anything happen.

939
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,240
Be careful.

940
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Who are you?

941
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,240
Deputy Chief.

942
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,240
We're talking about the unmarried woman.

943
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Have you confirmed that she has a daughter,

944
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,240
her name is Fuping,

945
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
and she's a woman with a husband and a wife.

946
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
I've never heard of her.

947
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
We're talking about the unmarried woman.

948
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
I'm afraid they've found her.

949
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,240
Don't forget,

950
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,240
the one named Fujin Ming,

951
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,240
she usually wears a wig and a wig.

952
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
She's the boss's wife.

953
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,240
Everyone calls her Fuchang.

954
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,240
I remember.

955
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,240
Isn't she forced to be a widow?

956
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
She has a daughter.

957
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
She's not even three years old.

958
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,240
What else is there in her house?

959
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
Only her grandparents.

960
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,240
I don't know.

961
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,240
Are you Fuping's second wife?

962
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,240
She's been arrested for a long time.

963
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,240
She's against the relationship between us.

964
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,240
We're her managers.

965
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
She's not bad in terms of her performance.

966
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,240
She was sentenced to 5,000 yuan for the punishment.

967
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,240
She's been unpaid for this.

968
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,240
If her family can pay for it,

969
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,240
we can give her a discount.

970
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,240
I'm used to it.

971
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Just wait.

972
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,240
Fujin Ming

973
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,240
Fujin Ming

974
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
I'm sorry.

975
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
I'm sorry.

976
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,240
I'm sorry.

977
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
I'm sorry.

978
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,240
I'm sorry.

979
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,240
I'm sorry.

980
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,240
Take care.

981
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Fuping has been back for two years.

982
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
We'll go and see him.

983
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,240
We'll leave soon.

984
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,240
Thank you.

985
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
Fujin Ming

986
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Mom, I'm sorry.

987
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Mom, I'm sorry.

988
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,240
Grandma.

989
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,240
Grandma.

990
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,240
Fuping's gift is for you.

991
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,240
Grandpa bought it for you.

992
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,240
He's a good performer.

993
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,240
He even won a prize.

994
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,240
That's good.

995
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,240
Let's go.

996
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Grandma.

997
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
I almost forgot.

998
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,240
This is for Grandpa.

999
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,240
Grandpa?

1000
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Let's go.

1001
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,240
Okay.

1002
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
Thank you.

1003
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,240
Grandpa.

1004
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
Happy!

1005
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,240
The man likes to love women

1006
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,240
Su Long Jiu

1007
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,240
The man is handsome

1008
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,240
He is a good man

1009
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
The man is handsome

1010
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
He is a good man

1011
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,240
He is a good man

1012
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,240
He is a good man

1013
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,240
He is a good man

1014
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,240
He is a good man

1015
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
Are you still in the car?

1016
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
You are not in the car?

1017
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
Buy one bottle

1018
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Buy one bottle

1019
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
Buy one bottle

1020
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,240
What is the car?

1021
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
You are in the car

1022
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,240
Boss, congratulations

1023
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,240
I have jumped eight steps with my sister

1024
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,240
I am Yuduan

1025
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,240
16 steps

1026
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,240
And 800 in total

1027
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,240
500 for you

1028
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Why do you need 300?

1029
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,240
She is a good girl

1030
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,240
But she has no attitude

1031
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,240
She is so good at drinking

1032
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,240
She is not enough to pay for it

1033
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,240
Besides, she is not a good girl

1034
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Boss, you are a big boss

1035
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
Don't be so stubborn

1036
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,240
I am not a boss

1037
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,240
You are a good man

1038
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,240
We should talk about it

1039
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,240
You can talk to my master

1040
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,240
I will take care of her

1041
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,240
See you

1042
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,240
Run

1043
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,240
Zainan

1044
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,240
You're so stupid.

1045
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
I've been waiting for half a month.

1046
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,240
You're the one who gave me the sound.

1047
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,240
I'll pick a piece of eye-catching,

1048
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,240
and put it on the watch.

1049
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,240
Then I'll give it to my sister.

1050
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,240
You're so old-fashioned.

1051
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,240
Why are you so stupid?

1052
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,240
Don't touch me.

1053
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,240
I'll shout.

1054
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
I'll shout.

1055
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,240
I'll shout.

1056
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,240
You...

1057
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,240
Don't touch me.

1058
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,240
I'll give you 30 bucks.

1059
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,240
Go.

1060
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,240
Go.

1061
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,240
Go.

1062
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,240
Go.

1063
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,240
Go.

1064
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,240
Go.

1065
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,240
Go.

1066
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,240
Go.

1067
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,240
Go.

1068
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,240
Go.

1069
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,240
Go.

1070
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,240
Go.

1071
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,240
Go.

1072
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,240
Go.

1073
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,240
Go.

1074
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,240
Go.

1075
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,240
Please, don't hurt me.

1076
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,240
Please, don't hurt me.

1077
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,240
Please, don't bully me.

1078
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,240
You can't eat me, can you?

1079
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,240
You're still trying to kill me?

1080
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,240
My mother was born in a big prison.

1081
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,240
If you don't kill us, I'll kill you.

1082
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,240
Don't hurt me.

1083
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,240
Don't hurt me.

1084
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
I'm going to kill you.

1085
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,240
You can't.

1086
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,240
You can't do this.

1087
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,240
I'll kill you.

1088
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,240
I'll kill you.

1089
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,240
I'll kill you.

1090
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,240
I'll kill you.

1091
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,240
You got a heart attack.

1092
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,240
You almost getほBirth.

1093
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,240
I was going to kill you was Bondi.

1094
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,240
We still think about our three children.

1095
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,240
Where should we find播udio?

1096
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,240
No need to see our mother's mother.

1097
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,040
We don't want to see her,

1098
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,040
Zhang Huo, where else can we find a job?

1099
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,040
My mother only knows money.

1100
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,040
If she can take me back,

1101
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,040
everything else will be a waste.

1102
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
I told you to cheat money.

1103
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,040
I didn't cheat money.

1104
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
I also made 500.

1105
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,040
I want to sell it.

1106
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,040
You can sell it for 65.

1107
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
Who do you think I am?

1108
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,040
I'm not a fool.

1109
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
I'm not a fool.

1110
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,040
Get lost!

1111
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
I'll kick you out of my house!

1112
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,040
I don't want to see you!

1113
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
Get lost!

1114
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,040
Get lost!

1115
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,040
I'll kill you!

1116
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,040
I'll kill you!

1117
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,040
I'll kill you!

1118
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
I'll kill you!

1119
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,040
I'll kill you!

1120
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,040
I'm not a fool.

1121
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,040
I'll kill myself.

1122
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,040
I'll kill you!

1123
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Thank you.

1124
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,040
You're not a fool, are you?

1125
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,040
How did you get the disease?

1126
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,040
You're a liar.

1127
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,040
Give me 20 yuan to take my money back.

1128
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,040
This is a fake.

1129
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,040
They're not cheating.

1130
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,040
They're all fake.

1131
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,040
My name is Dong Hong.

1132
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
I'm a female architect

1133
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,040
who came to the police station to find the key.

1134
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,040
I'm a police officer.

1135
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
You're all my partners in charge of the fraud.

1136
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,040
I hope you can be in the process

1137
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,040
of managing the fake fraud

1138
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,040
and be able to pay for the work

1139
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,040
in the hands of the central government.

1140
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,040
Now, let's start the order.

1141
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,040
Guo Anmei.

1142
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,040
Has Guo Anmei not come yet?

1143
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Does anyone know her?

1144
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,040
No.

1145
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,040
Hello?

1146
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,040
We're from the Xie Zhang Pachu.

1147
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,040
Your fraud case against Guo Anmei

1148
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,040
was brought to us by us.

1149
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
Please come here and check the situation.

1150
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,040
Hello?

1151
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,040
Manager Dong, why are you here?

1152
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,040
It's all your fault.

1153
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,040
Hello?

1154
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,040
Hello?

1155
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,040
I'm the police officer of the Sifat.

1156
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,040
Dong Hong.

1157
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,040
What's wrong with them?

1158
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,040
They're fighting.

1159
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,040
Fighting?

1160
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
Officer Chen.

1161
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,040
Is Guo Anmei

1162
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,040
the fake suspect in your community?

1163
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,040
Are you Guo Anmei?

1164
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,040
Yes.

1165
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,040
I'm the first to check.

1166
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,040
Do you know these two girls?

1167
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,040
I used to be their manager.

1168
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,040
That's right.

1169
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,040
They were both in the same group.

1170
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
They were not that big.

1171
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,040
They were only a few hundred dollars.

1172
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,040
First, they were in the same group.

1173
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,040
Second, they were in the same group.

1174
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,040
They were in the same group.

1175
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,040
They couldn't fight anymore.

1176
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,040
Third, they were fighting.

1177
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,040
They were in the same group.

1178
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,040
Actually, they were in the same group.

1179
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
They were fighting.

1180
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,040
Third,

1181
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,040
if you're willing to take the live report,

1182
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,040
if you're willing to,

1183
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,040
everyone can check it out.

1184
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,040
The name of the company will be sent back.

1185
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,040
You two have been together since you came out.

1186
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,040
The two of you are in the same house.

1187
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Gao Yixiang,

1188
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,040
tell me, Anmei.

1189
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,040
If you two don't have any food,

1190
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,040
come and look for me.

1191
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,040
You can't do this kind of thing again.

1192
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,040
Yes.

1193
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,040
You three are quite close to me.

1194
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,040
Guan Anmei,

1195
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,040
pull a group back.

1196
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,040
Put me in there.

1197
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,040
At least, you can give me a hand every week.

1198
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,040
Yes.

1199
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,040
Are you hungry?

1200
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,040
Have you lost your money?

1201
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,040
You're giving me back your money?

1202
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Thank you, Guan Anmei.

1203
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,040
Then, come and eat with us.

1204
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,040
The clothes and clothes are not in the right place.

1205
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,040
You two can go and eat.

1206
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,040
Can you drink some?

1207
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,040
Don't be so stubborn.

1208
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,040
You're not good at this kind of thing.

1209
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,040
You can't fight.

1210
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,040
Come with us.

1211
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,040
The name of the group is Qian'anhua.

1212
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,040
Yes.

1213
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,040
What kind of second-class protection is that?

1214
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,040
It's a monkey.

1215
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,040
It's the kind of monkey

1216
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,040
that can be put in your hand.

1217
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,040
Then, what did you do?

1218
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,040
I bought it online for four thousand yuan.

1219
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,040
I sold it for eight thousand yuan.

1220
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,040
I was taken by the police.

1221
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,040
I was given a bag of it.

1222
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,040
I was suspected.

1223
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,040
We are all people who are in the same group.

1224
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,040
No one is jealous of us.

1225
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,040
At the same time,

1226
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,040
the group is not in the same group.

1227
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,040
What did you give him when you were young?

1228
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,040
I gave him money.

1229
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,040
He is a good person.

1230
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,040
He lied to me.

1231
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,040
It's not good.

1232
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,040
He is in the hotel.

1233
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,040
I also put on your feet.

1234
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,040
And I also cut your hair.

1235
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,040
I'm sorry.

1236
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
If anyone bullies you again,

1237
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,040
I will teach you two of us

1238
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,040
to beat him up.

1239
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,040
Dad.

1240
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,040
You are a black society.

1241
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,040
I really am a black society.

1242
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,040
My daughter doesn't have to

1243
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,040
stay in the mansion.

1244
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,040
You don't like to listen to me?

1245
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,040
You are in the mansion.

1246
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,040
You have a guarantee

1247
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,040
that you will live a life

1248
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,040
that is not broken by you.

1249
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,040
My life is dirty.

1250
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,040
But my daughter's life is clean.

1251
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,040
I gave birth to him.

1252
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,040
I only have a little bit of him.

1253
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,040
Gao Yuxiang.

1254
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,040
Hongjie.

1255
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
Did you do the phone stick?

1256
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,040
I have already asked.

1257
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,040
The cost of the bed is more than 1,000 yuan.

1258
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,040
It's not small at all.

1259
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Hongjie.

1260
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,040
You really only see the thief eat meat.

1261
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,040
You don't see the thief fight.

1262
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,040
You go out to make a lot of money.

1263
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
There are many places where people are lively.

1264
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,040
It's a long way to go.

1265
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,040
There are few places where people can't stick a few sticks.

1266
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,040
Besides,

1267
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,040
we have to practice.

1268
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,040
With our phone,

1269
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,040
we have to spend more time

1270
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,040
to buy new phones.

1271
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,040
We don't have to spend much time.

1272
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,040
Then we have to find another one.

1273
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,040
I have a friend who is sleeping in the car.

1274
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,040
I will help you find a way.

1275
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,040
Where do you sleep?

1276
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,040
This house.

1277
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,040
Let me.

1278
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
The house is not bad.

1279
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,040
How much is the monthly rent?

1280
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,040
200 yuan.

1281
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,040
How much is the bed?

1282
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,040
200 yuan.

1283
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,040
There is a table and a bed.

1284
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,040
It's 400 yuan.

1285
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,040
Officer Deng.

1286
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,040
Yes.

1287
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,040
I want a private room for them.

1288
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,040
As long as this can be a special place for them.

1289
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,040
Where did you get this uniform?

1290
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,040
I bought it online.

1291
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Why did you buy the uniform?

1292
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,040
It's a house.

1293
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
You are lying.

1294
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,040
You are not allowed to buy the uniform.

1295
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
Why do you want to wear the uniform?

1296
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,040
Grandma,

1297
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,040
have you ever bought two police cars?

1298
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,040
I have.

1299
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,040
Did you give 500 yuan?

1300
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,040
Yes.

1301
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,040
I thought it was a car.

1302
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,040
It's a car.

1303
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,040
The police are not allowed to buy it.

1304
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,040
It's not a human.

1305
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,040
They are not allowed to buy it.

1306
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,040
They are a common person.

1307
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,040
They are a common person.

1308
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,040
They are not allowed to buy it.

1309
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,040
They want money.

1310
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,040
They want to see how hard life is in the house.

1311
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
They are too scared to do that.

1312
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,040
They give 500 yuan.

1313
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,040
Then how about we give them 500 yuan?

1314
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,040
No, you can stay.

1315
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,040
Their behavior is the crime of crime in law.

1316
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,040
If you chase them,

1317
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,040
they can also be punished.

1318
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,040
I think they are good people.

1319
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Officer Deng.

1320
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,040
Please think of the idea,

1321
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
and then tell me.

1322
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
No, you can't.

1323
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,040
You have two old reformers.

1324
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,040
If I sell the house,

1325
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,040
they will be all over the place.

1326
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,040
Then my child will be beaten.

1327
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,040
It's not old reformers.

1328
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,040
It's the police.

1329
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
I am their manager.

1330
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,040
I can be responsible for any problem.

1331
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,040
Can you be sure?

1332
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,040
You are also looking for someone to make a statement.

1333
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,040
It's good to send them to the police.

1334
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
If you think this plan is feasible,

1335
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,040
you can try it.

1336
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,040
If you sell it,

1337
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,040
you can give them a proposal.

1338
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,040
If you can't sell it,

1339
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,040
you can't be a good person.

1340
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,040
It's your sister's responsibility

1341
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
to be the one who is angry with the family.

1342
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,040
The door is locked behind me.

1343
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,040
It's the most common app in the world.

1344
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,040
How is their safety?

1345
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,040
Let's check it out.

1346
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,040
Let's check the lock.

1347
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
The lock is on.

1348
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,040
Start.

1349
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,040
It's so fast.

1350
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,040
It's so fast.

1351
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040
It's so fast.

1352
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040
It's so fast.

1353
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
It's so fast.

1354
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
It's so fast.

1355
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,040
It's so fast.

1356
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,040
Open three locks.

1357
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,040
The time is 23 seconds.

1358
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:11,040
Is it okay to open them?

1359
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,040
Are you safe?

1360
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,040
It's so fast.

1361
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,040
It's so fast.

1362
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Don't worry.

1363
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,040
This is the latest

1364
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,040
lock in the world.

1365
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,040
The lock is the latest

1366
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
lock in the world.

1367
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,040
Let's open it for 20 seconds.

1368
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,040
Let's see if we can open it.

1369
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,040
Don't worry.

1370
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,040
We'll give it another 10 seconds.

1371
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,040
It's so fast.

1372
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,040
Okay, time's up.

1373
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,040
Is it safe to buy

1374
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:59,040
our lock?

1375
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
Today is the new

1376
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,040
brand-new launch.

1377
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,040
We're going to buy

1378
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,040
our lock today.

1379
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,040
Enjoy the 9-zell party.

1380
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,040
The money for the house

1381
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040
is 388 yuan.

1382
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,040
Give me a set.

1383
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,040
Give me a set.

1384
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,040
Mom, have some food.

1385
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,040
Why don't you move your chopsticks?

1386
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,040
I'm waiting for you.

1387
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,040
Congratulations.

1388
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,040
You've earned money.

1389
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Sister Hong, you're a good person.

1390
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,040
You're all in the wine.

1391
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,040
And the nurse?

1392
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,040
We're in the police.

1393
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
Okay.

1394
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
Can you call me Brother Huo?

1395
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,040
You're late.

1396
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,040
I have to call you.

1397
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,040
Brother Huo, thank you for helping us.

1398
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
I know you're the boss.

1399
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,040
Otherwise, we wouldn't have a business.

1400
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,040
Don't think we're too much.

1401
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,040
We're not experienced.

1402
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
It's serious.

1403
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,040
I'm not a good person.

1404
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,040
I'm a good person.

1405
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,040
Don't be so formal.

1406
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,040
Sit down.

1407
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
I'll take care of you.

1408
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,040
I'll take care of you.

1409
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,040
I'll listen to you.

1410
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,040
You're welcome.

1411
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
You should thank

1412
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,040
the nurse.

1413
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,040
You promised to give me

1414
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,040
the red packet.

1415
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,040
I did.

1416
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,040
I'm married.

1417
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,040
I'm not a businessman.

1418
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,040
I'm a good person.

1419
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,040
I know what I'm good at.

1420
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,040
You should take care of us.

1421
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,040
Cheers.

1422
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,040
I'll give you the red packet

1423
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,040
when you're hungry.

1424
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,040
Sister Hong, I've been thinking.

1425
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,040
Why are you so nice to us?

1426
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,040
My dad used to be a manager of the factory.

1427
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,040
He took the old man

1428
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,040
to go out to the market.

1429
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,040
A man found a wife under the bridge.

1430
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,040
When the man reported the wife to the meeting,

1431
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,040
he accidentally stepped on his ice cream

1432
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,040
and took her to the rescue.

1433
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,040
The man pushed the child to the ice cream.

1434
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,040
He didn't get on it.

1435
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,040
He didn't get on it.

1436
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,040
My dad was upset.

1437
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,040
He took the child.

1438
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,040
You're the one who's upset.

1439
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,040
Later, my dad was in the hospital

1440
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,040
when he was diagnosed with a stroke.

1441
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,040
I got a good dad.

1442
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,040
He's a good man.

1443
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,040
I'm a good man.

1444
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,040
I'm a good man.

1445
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,040
I'm a good man.

1446
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,040
I'm a good man.

1447
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,040
I'm a good man.

1448
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,040
This is your presentation.

1449
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,040
I think you should

1450
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,040
make a video

1451
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,040
and spread it online.

1452
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,040
Then you can

1453
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,040
make a video for the whole family.

1454
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,040
I'll take your daughter

1455
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,040
and bring her home

1456
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,040
with three of us.

1457
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,040
We'll be apart forever.

1458
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,040
I'll make a video for you.

1459
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,040
Si Fang.

1460
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,040
Si Fang.

1461
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,040
Si Fang.

1462
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,040

1463
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,040

1468

1469
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,040
Si Fang.

1470
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,040
Si Fang.

1471
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
Si Fang.

1472
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,040
Si Fang.

1473
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,040
Si Fang.

1474
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
Si Fang.

1475
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,040

1480
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,040

1481
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,040
Si Fang.

1482
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,040
Si Fang.

1483
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,040
Si Fang.

1484
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,040
Si Fang.

1485
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,040
Si Fang.

1486
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,040
Si Fang.

1487
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,040
Si Fang.

1488
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
Si Fang.

1489
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,040
Si Fang.

1490
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,040
Si Fang.

1491
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,040

1492

1497

01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,040
Si Fang.

1505
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,040
Si Fang.

1506
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,040
Si Dahiruo.

1507
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,040
Si Dahiruo.

1508
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,040
Si Dahiruo.

1509
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,040
Si Dahiruo.

1510
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,040
Si Dahiruo.

1511
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,040
Si Dahiruo.

1512
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,040
Si Dahiruo.

1513
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,040
Si Dahiruo.

1514
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,040
Si Dahiruo.

1515
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,040
Too heavy.

1516
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,020
firefighter

1517
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:07,340
oh

1518
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,020
Wow

1519
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,300
It hurts, no!

1520
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,220
I'm not done yet!

1521
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:31,260
It hurt a lot!

1522
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,700
We really can have a good trip!

1523
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,540
Hope we will be back to find some good food!

1524
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:42,380
I have 6 Dimgers worth of Tomahawk tickets!

1525
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,020
Its my first time to come to it,

1526
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,580
so I really could trust Him!

1527
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,900
Itsaal!

1528
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,180
Ok!

1529
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,260
That sounds good.

1530
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:56,060
So,

1531
01:31:56,060 --> 01:32:00,060
I'm going to take her away today.

1532
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,060
Is it just a cat or a good cat?

1533
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,060
She's not a doctor.

1534
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,060
If you don't want her, just throw her away.

1535
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:09,060
She's a life-threatening person.

1536
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:11,060
I'm her mother.

1537
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:14,060
Even if I'm a dog, I have the right to raise a pig.

1538
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:17,060
Your husband is still her father.

1539
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:23,060
Of course, the six forces are not equal.

1540
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:26,060
We don't have to be so harsh.

1541
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:29,060
We have to be very careful.

1542
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,060
The economy is very good.

1543
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,060
They are doing well.

1544
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,060
You know, there are a lot of people.

1545
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,060
They are still doing well.

1546
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,060
They are doing well.

1547
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,060
They are doing well.

1548
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,060
They are doing well.

1549
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,060
They are doing well.

1550
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,060
You think they are doing well?

1551
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,060
We are parents.

1552
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,060
We can't be too selfish.

1553
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:53,060
We have to be careful.

1554
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,060
I can see you again.

1555
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:04,060
You are here.

1556
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:08,060
I don't mind you leaving.

1557
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,060
I still have to go to the room.

1558
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,060
Everything is for the good of the child.

1559
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,060
I'm going to the room.

1560
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,060
I'm going to the room.

1561
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,060
I'm going to the room.

1562
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,060
I'm going to the room.

1563
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,060
I'm going to the room.

1564
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,060
I'm going to the room.

1565
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,060
You are pretending all the time.

1566
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,060
Mom,

1567
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,060
tell me the truth.

1568
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:08,060
Don't talk to me.

1569
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,060
Be safe.

1570
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,060
The police caught you.

1571
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,060
You are not good.

1572
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,060
Then what are you pretending to be with me?

1573
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,060
He thought of you.

1574
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:21,060
He thought of you.

1575
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,060
I thought of it.

1576
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:37,060
They think I'm not good.

1577
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,060
They think I'm not good.

1578
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,060
They think I'm not good.

1579
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:46,060
I'm going to the room.

1580
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:51,060
Tell me.

1581
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:55,060
I'm scared.

1582
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:59,060
So I used my hand.

1583
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,060
I'm sorry.

1584
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,060
You are worried about me, right?

1585
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:11,060
I'm afraid you can't think of it.

1586
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,060
Actually, I can't think of it.

1587
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,060
I was wronged.

1588
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:21,060
I tied the child on the back.

1589
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:24,060
The new tower of the old house.

1590
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:27,060
I thought of it.

1591
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,060
The wind was too strong.

1592
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:33,060
The child cried.

1593
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,060
I was soft.

1594
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,060
After the fall,

1595
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,060
the life was hard.

1596
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,060
I think I can live.

1597
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,060
I will be used to it.

1598
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,060
I can't go to the first tower.

1599
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,060
I will stand on the high place.

1600
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,060
I will think of it.

1601
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,060
What if it falls down?

1602
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,060
It will be a waste of time.

1603
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:09,060
We will go to the brick building.

1604
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,060
The brick building?

1605
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:15,060
We won't say anything to hurt each other anymore.

1606
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:18,060
Okay?

1607
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,060
Okay.

1608
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,060
Today, we hope that through the capital,

1609
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,060
the generous consumers,

1610
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,060
the relatives, and the whole building

1611
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:34,060
will be safe.

1612
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,060
Let's wait and see.

1613
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,060
Let's go.

1614
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:43,060
Four seconds.

1615
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,060
The second tower is five seconds long.

1616
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,060
This door can be said to be a luxury.

1617
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,060
These are for the government.

1618
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,060
If they don't give us a living, we will be in trouble.

1619
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,060
They can't see us.

1620
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,060
They will give us a big ad.

1621
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:07,060
They will say that they are the best.

1622
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,060
They will be in trouble.

1623
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:13,060
They will say that they are the best.

1624
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,060
Didn't you tell him to wake up?

1625
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,060
You can't.

1626
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:44,060
Our video is a five-day video.

1627
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:47,060
How many lockers did you sell?

1628
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,060
Two thousand.

1629
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:53,060
Look.

1630
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,060
You are old and tall.

1631
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,060
We are three seven.

1632
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,060
This is yours.

1633
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,060
What are you doing?

1634
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,060
You see?

1635
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,060
This is our life.

1636
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,060
If I don't go back,

1637
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,060
he will die.

1638
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
Go back.

1639
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:58,060
Don't come to me.

1640
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,060
We won't see each other again.

1641
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:04,060
I will go back.

1642
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,060
I will go back.

1643
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,060
We won't see each other again.

1644
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:13,060
Give me back the money.

1645
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,060
Give it to Hao.

1646
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:25,060
Hey, Xiao Bao Le.

1647
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,060
Did you find him?

1648
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:41,060
The police found him.

1649
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:43,060
You took him to the warehouse.

1650
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,060
You took him to the police.

1651
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,060
You found him.

1652
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:49,060
It's a white-collar company.

1653
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,060
Where did the police find him?

1654
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,060
Where is he?

1655
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,060
He doesn't want to come back.

1656
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,060
No way.

1657
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,060
I checked the evidence.

1658
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,060
Did the police ask him if he was kidnapped?

1659
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:04,060
The police asked him if he was kidnapped.

1660
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,060
He also said no.

1661
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
He said that he was his family.

1662
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,060
He was a orphan.

1663
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,060
Nonsense.

1664
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,060
He is a thief.

1665
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:16,060
He is a liar.

1666
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:18,060
He was raised and forced to go to jail.

1667
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,060
The police should have taken him away.

1668
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,060
The police should have taken him away.

1669
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:26,060
He doesn't want to come back.

1670
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:28,060
What can the police do?

1671
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:30,060
He took away his whole process.

1672
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,060
He didn't do anything illegal.

1673
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,060
The company is also a legal company.

1674
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,060
The police should be punished.

1675
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,060
The police should be punished.

1676
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,060
I know now.

1677
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,060
Why are you afraid of the police?

1678
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,060
Because when he goes out,

1679
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,060
they will catch him again.

1680
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:53,060
I killed him.

1681
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:57,060
They will force him to go back.

1682
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:00,060
You are so stupid.

1683
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,060
You are a liar.

1684
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,060
And...

1685
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,060
And a adopted husband.

1686
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:08,060
He is a police officer.

1687
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:10,060
He wants to use the money to make money.

1688
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:12,060
He wants to take your money.

1689
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:16,060
What kind of a dog-n-dog-family adopted husband?

1690
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,060
You are so stubborn.

1691
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,060
Why are you wearing this?

1692
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:23,060
Who are you talking to?

1693
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,060
I took off this dress because you are my sister.

1694
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,060
I don't care if you scold me.

1695
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:31,060
But I can't wear the dress I'm wearing.

1696
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,060
You can't wear the dirty clothes.

1697
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:38,060
You are not even willing to go to the head of the black-and-white demon.

1698
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:41,060
You still want to give the money to the thief.

1699
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:44,060
You still say they are legal.

1700
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,060
We can bully them.

1701
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:51,060
We can make them pay for our crimes.

1702
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,060
We can be legal.

1703
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,060
We can only protect you.

1704
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:59,060
You are so stupid.

1705
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:03,060
Gao Yixiao, I told you that you are a liar.

1706
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,060
You are so stupid.

1707
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:07,060
You are willing to go to the head of the black-and-white demon.

1708
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,060
I didn't give you the money.

1709
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:13,060
I just want to take your life.

1710
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:16,060
I beg you to help me find the way out.

1711
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,060
But I don't care if you are going to marry me.

1712
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,060
We want to be good people.

1713
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,060
We can't do anything about it.

1714
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:54,060
Happy birthday

1715
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:17,060
Hello, General Manager Xun.

1716
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,560
Have you felt asleep?

1717
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:21,060
...

1718
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:29,060
...

1719
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:34,060
...

1720
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,060
Are you his father?

1721
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:41,060
Are you Bai Hu?

1722
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:43,060
I want to do a business with you.

1723
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,060
Are you alive or dead?

1724
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:50,060
This 50 yuan is usually blackmail,

1725
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,060
usually mine,

1726
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,060
I'll give you all of it.

1727
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,060
I'll take her away.

1728
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,060
You're not talking.

1729
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,060
Let her talk to herself.

1730
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,060
Let me go.

1731
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:05,060
Don't bother me.

1732
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:06,060
I'll go.

1733
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:12,060
Nizi.

1734
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,060
Nizi.

1735
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:18,060
You don't want to talk at home.

1736
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:22,060
You have to be kind and humble.

1737
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:25,060
You've been fighting for so many years.

1738
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,060
But you're still a loser.

1739
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:31,060
You're talking to an outsider.

1740
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,060
You're so cruel.

1741
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,060
You're telling the truth.

1742
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,060
Do you want to go with her?

1743
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,060
Go back to work.

1744
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Go.

1745
01:47:56,060 --> 01:47:57,060
You're so cruel.

1746
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:00,060
But you're still a loser.

1747
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,060
You're talking to an outsider.

1748
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,060
You're a coward.

1749
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,060
Brother.

1750
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:43,060
Brother.

1751
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:58,060
You're not even a little bit more cruel.

1752
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:00,060
You've already lost your hand.

1753
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,060
Let go of your hand.

1754
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:04,060
But she lost her hand.

1755
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:07,060
It's the Internet that has stolen everyone's hand.

1756
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:09,060
The world is a thief.

1757
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:11,060
Even if you don't lock the door,

1758
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,060
the world will be a thief.

1759
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,060
WeChat,

1760
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,060
the computer,

1761
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,060
and the password.

1762
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:18,060
We've already turned the tables.

1763
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,060
Why did you still let her go?

1764
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,060
I have a law.

1765
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:24,060
I have a law.

1766
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:26,060
Didn't you talk to me about business?

1767
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,060
I'll give you some money.

1768
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:30,060
I've returned her hand.

1769
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,060
But I've raised her a lot since I was a kid.

1770
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:36,060
You don't even have enough water to drink.

1771
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:38,060
Her hand is broken.

1772
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:40,060
She's not even a little bit more cruel.

1773
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:43,060
You just saw the sisters who were talking to the door.

1774
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,060
I'll give you some advice.

1775
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,060
I'll give you some money.

1776
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,060
I'll sell you my life.

1777
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:57,060
You're a coward.

1778
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:59,060
Why did you let her go?

1779
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:00,060
You're still a liar.

1780
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,060
You still say you don't want to fight?

1781
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:03,060
You're not even a little bit more cruel.

1782
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:06,060
You're not even a little bit more cruel.

1783
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:10,060
You still say you don't want to fight?

1784
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:28,620
You will have your revenge and success in your life.

1785
01:50:28,620 --> 01:50:32,020
my son was addicted

1786
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:33,260
a little, a little bit

1787
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:36,940
why do we just have to kill ourselves?

1788
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:39,300
help

1789
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:43,420
get off, get off

1790
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,180
I can't move

1791
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:47,420
get off

1792
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:33,620
The End

1793
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:35,620
Episode 1

1794
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:41,620
Can you save that group of people?

1795
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:43,620
I haven't tried it yet.

1796
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:44,620
Don't let them die.

1797
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,620
They'll be dead in a flash.

1798
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:47,620
How is it?

1799
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:49,620
It's not a secret.

1800
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,620
We're going to give him a shoe.

1801
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:54,620
Then tell him what shoe he is.

1802
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,620
He's a Lei Mo Man.

1803
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:56,620
We're learning.

1804
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:57,620
We're learning from the Xichun.

1805
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,620
We're learning from Kongnong.

1806
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,620
We've contacted the Xie Zhongxing.

1807
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:02,620
They're not enough.

1808
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,620
Xie Zhongxing gave a clue.

1809
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,620
The female Xie Zhongxing's pregnancy

1810
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:07,620
is the same as Xie's.

1811
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,620
I'm not a Xie.

1812
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:09,620
I'm still a student.

1813
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,620
I don't have any other choice.

1814
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:13,620
Fu Ping.

1815
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:17,620
Li Huo and Gao Yuxiang are both friends.

1816
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,620
Xiang Yang sent a message.

1817
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:21,620
They're not old.

1818
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,620
Gao Yuxiang is dead.

1819
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:26,620
You can't just watch him walk to the end.

1820
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,620
Are you here?

1821
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:33,620
Yes.

1822
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:37,620
Officer Geng is in your room.

1823
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,620
You haven't seen Ai Jie in four years.

1824
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:41,620
Do you want to make a video?

1825
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:47,620
Deng Heng, give Ai Jie the phone.

1826
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:48,620
Okay.

1827
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:52,620
Ai Jie, I'm Fu Ping's manager.

1828
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:54,620
Your daughter is right next to me.

1829
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:56,620
You can have a chat.

1830
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,620
Okay.

1831
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:58,620
Okay.

1832
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,620
Let's talk to Ai Jie.

1833
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,620
Lin Bin, are you okay?

1834
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,620
You're so beautiful.

1835
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,620
You're always smiling at us.

1836
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:12,620
I'm so happy to see you come back.

1837
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,620
I've been waiting for you for two months.

1838
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,620
You've been waiting for me.

1839
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:20,620
You're so happy to see me.

1840
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,620
I'm so happy to see you.

1841
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,620
I'm so happy to see you.

1842
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:26,620
I'm so happy to see you.

1843
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,620
What's the money?

1844
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:31,620
I didn't give my family the money.

1845
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,620
That's what Hu Ping is.

1846
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:35,620
After Gao Yuxiang and her mother were out,

1847
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:37,620
she went to your room to see your daughter.

1848
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,620
She gave you 500 yuan.

1849
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,620
I'm sorry.

1850
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:43,620
It's okay.

1851
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:46,620
Lin Bin, you can help her.

1852
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:49,620
She's a good person.

1853
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:54,620
Let's go.

1854
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:11,620
I'm sorry.

1855
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:13,620
I'm sorry.

1856
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:15,620
I'm sorry.

1857
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:17,620
I'm sorry.

1858
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,620
I'm sorry.

1859
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,620
I'm sorry.

1860
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:23,620
I'm sorry.

1861
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:25,620
I'm sorry.

1862
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:27,620
I'm sorry.

1863
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,620
I'm sorry.

1864
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:31,620
I'm sorry.

1865
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:33,620
I'm sorry.

1866
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:35,620
I'm sorry.

1867
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:37,620
I'm sorry.

1868
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,620

I was really worried.

1873
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:21,620
My mom is a little upset.

1874

Please bring your belongings.

1883
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:56,620

1885

Look, who is that?

1886

Did you come out?

1887

Come here.

1888

Call me this child.

1889
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:10,620
How did you promise me?

1890
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:12,620
What's your mother's name?

1891
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:14,620
Call me mother.

1892
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:16,620
Call me.

1893
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:18,620
Don't bother him.

1894
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:34,620
Let's go.

1895
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,620
Let's go.

1896
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:54,620
He is not used to it yet.

1897
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,620
He may be used to it.

1898
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:58,620
When I hear the sound,

1899
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:00,620
my head starts to explode.

1900
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:02,620
The doctor said he was very careful.

1901
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,620
We have a magic stick here.

1902
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:14,620

Thank you for the blood.

1913
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:38,620
If he is dead, I won't come out.

1914
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,620
You saved me.

1915
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:42,620
I am sorry.

1916
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:44,620
Great. We have to go out again.

1917
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:52,620
White fox.

1918

You are out.

1919
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:56,620
Pingjing.

1920
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,620
Heimei said you are on fire.

1921
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,620
You are over a million.

1922
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,620
I have been in the house for years.

1923
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,620
You have been in the house for years.

1924
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,620
Heimei, you have to prove it.

1925
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,620
I have made the promise.

1926
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:10,620
Yes.

1927
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,620
Xiangyang and Ata are in the house.

1928
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,620
We are all rich.

1929
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:16,620
Don't be angry.

1930
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,620
Don't be angry.

1931
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:20,620
Are you kidding me?

1932
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:22,620
Sunbao.

1933
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,620
Sunbao.

1934
01:58:24,620 --> 01:58:26,620
My car is all written on the back seat.

1935
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:28,620
The police are here to prove it.

1936
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:30,620
Help me.

1937
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,620
You can't do it.

1938
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,620
I have been in the house for several times.

1939
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:36,620
Please help me.

1940
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:38,620
I will show you the proof.

1941
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:40,620
The car is full of blood.

1942
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,620
Don't mention it.

1943
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:44,620
A woman just came up.

1944
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:46,620
Her husband chased her.

1945
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,620
I am a police officer.

1946
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,620
I have been to several houses.

1947
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:52,620
I don't like it.

1948
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,620
You can go to the kitchen.

1949

1950
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:58,620

Come in.

1952
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:08,620
Let me have a look.

1953
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:10,620
The business is in the battlefield.

1954
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,620
Take care of the master.

1955
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:16,620
I want to...

1956
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:20,620
Sister Hong, you don't have to do it.

I am the chief officer.

1958

You can do it.

1959
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:28,620
Master Guan is a doctor.

1960
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,620
Although we are sisters,

1961
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:32,620
we are also doctors.

1962
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:34,620
We are not a doctor.

1963
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:36,620
But we are not afraid of the disease.

1964
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:38,620
Please take care of us.
