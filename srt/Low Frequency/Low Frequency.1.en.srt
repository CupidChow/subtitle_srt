1
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,039
- Mon!
- Huh?

2
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,510
Come with me

3
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,510
So we can play together like we used to.

4
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,680
Do you hate me?

5
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,640
You said we’ll always be friends?

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,120
You lied.
You broke our promise.

7
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
- I didn’t lie!
- You lied!

8
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
You’re a liar!

9
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,229
Liar! Liar!

10
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,509
Liar! Liar! Liar!

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,509
Ah!

12
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Have you ever had the same dream
repeatedly?

13
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,630
I think we might have had some before.

14
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,150
Once? Twice?

15
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,910
But for me,

16
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,750
this is the eighteenth time.

17
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:32,150
since my dear friend Guy passed away

18
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,360
Hello, audience! There is something that I am really proud to tell you.

19
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
that Tong and Kratuo are flying to Tokyo, Japan

20
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,280
for their first fanmeeting

21
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,520
Every night before the anniversary of the incident,

22
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
that dream

23
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,430
since I was 10.

24
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,920
keeps running over and over

25
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,390
Throughout the past eighteen years

26
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,430
It has been proven that there is
no doctor

27
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,720
or holy things that can help me.

28
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,560
This way, please.

29
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,070
I’m sorry, Guy.

30
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,870
I’m really sorry.

31
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,920
- Hey, Mon.
- Hi.

32
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,310
What?

33
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,240
Hey

34
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,310
You didn’t get grilled pork for me today?

35
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,190
I gave alms to the monk this morning.

36
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,190
I only had a glass of water for breakfast.

37
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,000
Did that fill you up?

38
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,070
Obviously not.
I planned to have some bread here.

39
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,270
uh, Mon

40
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,480
So, do you still have that nightmare?

41
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,510
Yeah.
As usual.

42
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,560
But I think, this time,

43
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,630
it’s longer and scarier.

44
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,000
You’re overthinking.

45
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,040
I have this nightmare every year.
It has been eighteen years now.

46
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
I know all the details.

47
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,040
You’re right.

48
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Do you know what it means?

49
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,240
I have no idea

50
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,070
I think he tried to warn me.

51
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,430
So,

52
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,870
you’re about to face a misfortune

53
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,720
and he

54
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,120
tries to warn you?

55
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,560
The only misfortune I know is

56
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,070
this design for Bridal House

57
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,510
The mother of the groom

58
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,240
who believes in fortune-telling, horoscopes, feng shui, and whatever else

59
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
Not to mention the couple themselves.
This gives me a headache.

60
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,800
But I don’t think so.

61
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,870
Don’t think what?

62
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,920
That misfortune isn’t your client.

63
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,920
I think it’s our boss.

64
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,950
Huh?

65
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,070
I just met Yak

66
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,159
and he told me to tell you to meet him.

67
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,240
I think this is your misfortune.

68
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,800
And you only told me just now?

69
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,310
You initiated a conversation with me

70
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,000
- so I just forget it!
- You are the one who did!

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
If he’s angry because I’m late,

72
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,270
I’ll have your head as my breakfast.

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Good luck.

74
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,480
Stop with your wishes.
Nothing good ever comes out of it.

75
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,190
Hey, Mon.

76
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,720
Can I have this?

77
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,430
Mon.

78
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,360
The Bridal House design for Tick

79
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,070
is approved!

80
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,240
She loves it so much!

81
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,480
You scared me!

82
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,960
I thought I had to redesign it
because of that Feng Shui thing.

83
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,600
And why did you ask to meet me?

84
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,510
Hm.

85
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,080
Here it is.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
I’m bringing you VIP job.

87
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,840
VIP?

88
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,870
Yeah, of course.

89
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,790
Ton knows my mom

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,630
and he saw your work.

91
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,840
He said he loves them.

92
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,750
then I just went ahead and offer it.

93
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,000
So, this condo design job

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,030
is easy-peasy for you right?

95
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,670
Easy?

96
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,840
Sure. Fine.

97
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,000
And how is this “VIP”?

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,790
Just because he knows your mom?

99
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Cut! Great job!

100
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,790
You did great.
Thank you.

101
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,080
That’s a wrap, everyone!

102
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,910
- Woo!
- Yeah!

103
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,750
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

104
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,150
You truly deserve to be a superstar, exceptionally talented indeed.

105
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,670
- Thank you.
- Awesome.

106
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,120
You two did so well.

107
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,030
- Thank you.
- I’ll see you again.

108
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
see you again.

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

110
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,720
You did well, Thames
Thank you.

111
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
Without you,
it would’ve been hard for me.

112
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,790
Thank you so much.
It has been fun.

113
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,630
We'll have a wrap party in two weeks.

114
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,390
You can't miss this time.

115
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
- Sure thing.
- I’ll see you.

116
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,120
- Sure. Thank you. Goodbye.
- Yep.

117
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,480
See you.

118
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,480
- Thank you, everyone.
- Let’s go home.

119
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

120
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,440
This series’ rating has been great

121
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,790
considering we only released
the behind-the-scenes footage.

122
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,550
Bua’s boy never been disappointed.
- Stop it.

123
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,120
Didn't you complain that the character didn't fit you?

124
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you going back to your condo
or home today?

125
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,360
Hm.

126
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
Home.

127
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,000
I have a job tomorrow evening, yes?

128
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,080
Yeah. You’re attending an event
of the toothpaste that you’re a presenter for.

129
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,750
Ah.

130
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,870
I’m going home.

131
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,670
I want to be with my grandma
and take a full rest.

132
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,030
Sure!

133
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I’ve got good news for you.

134
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
What good news?

135
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,790
After tomorrow’s job,
I’ll let you have a two-month break.

136
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Seriously?

137
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,390
I mean it.

138
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,150
Do you think that I enjoy exploiting actors?

139
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
You've been working so hard and lost some weight.

140
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,870
I love you, don't you know?

141
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,840
- I love you too!
- Stop it.

142
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,270
Just don’t do anything that will decrease your rating.

143
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,440
Don't overeat your grandma's food to gain weight rapidly.

144
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,750
Control your weight, okay?

145
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,240
Roger that.

146
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,750
- Let’s go home and take a rest!
- Let’s go.

147
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
We’ve arrived.
Wake up.

148
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,550
Get some rest.

149
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,870
Thank you, Bua.

150
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

151
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Mon, buy me some grilled pork
and sticky rice tomorrow.

152
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,720
I want ten sticks of grilled pork.

153
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,910
Thanks a lot.
My dear friend.

154
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,910
Ask me to buy?

155
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Without giving money,

156
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,240
you’re ordering free food!

157
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,320
I’ll settle that with your birthday gift.

158
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,240
Yes, Bua?

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,030
Mon, are you free?

160
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,120
Uh.

161
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,870
I guess so.
Why?

162
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,030
One of my actors came back
from a set in Chiang Mai.

163
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,270
Sing stopped by
and has something for you

164
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,670
Something for me?

165
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,150
He didn’t tell me anything.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,080
He’s probably too busy
and forgot.

167
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,510
If it’s food,
my mom just sent me some.

168
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,840
I think it’s something that he doesn’t want to ship it.

169
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,670
Do you know what it is?

170
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,790
An amulet.

171
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,510
Let’s meet our new toothpaste presenter,
Thames Tinnapat.

172
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Everyday with you

173
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,630
Everyday with Dr.Ray

174
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,600
I love it.

175
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,510
Sing along.

176
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,870
♫ You make any gloomy day become a bright day for me. ♫

177
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,790
♫ Your voice is like a song resonating from my heart. ♫

178
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,240
♫ My heart always melts every time I look at you ♫

179
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,550
as if I’m being pulled toward them. ♫

180
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,390
♫ It’s like I’m bound by magic ♫

181
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,670
♫ to fall for you. ♫

182
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,320
♫ Just letting you know. You make me feel like sunshine. ♫

183
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,120
♫ You, you make the whole world smile. ♫

184
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,510
♫ You, you are the magic of my life. ♫

185
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,670
♫ I want to be next to you. ♫

186
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,200
♫ A fraction of a second of your smile ♫

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,670
♫ gives me an entire night's worth of good dreams. ♫

188
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,630
♫ I don’t know how I can stop my heart. ♫

189
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,750
♫ It’s like I’m bound by magic. ♫

190
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:56,150
♫ Being next to you makes my whole day meaningful, baby. ♫

191
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:04,270
♫ I don’t want a sunrise; I just want to see your eyes. ♫

192
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,030
♫ My heart always melts every time I look at you ♫

193
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,480
as if I’m being pulled toward them. ♫

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,720
♫ It’s like I’m bound by magic ♫

195
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,910
♫ to fall for you. ♫

196
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,390
We haven’t met for a long time.

197
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,240
Didn’t we just meet a month ago?

198
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,480
- It has been two months.
- Oh?

199
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,150
What should we order?

200
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,080
First of all,
Don't you need to see your actor?

201
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,910
I talked to the organizer.

202
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,480
Thames can do this quite easily.

203
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,840
He seem to be very famous.

204
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,720
It’s clear you trained him well.

205
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,670
I didn’t have to do much for him.

206
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,440
He nailed every job himself.

207
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,750
Everyone agrees that he has a gut

208
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,360
No need to do much about him

209
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,589
That’s why his previous drama
came out on top of the chart.

210
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,720
Wow.
That’s great.

211
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,270
But do you know him too?

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
I initially didn’t

213
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,960
It’s just my boss ...

214
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,400
Doesn’t that surname ring any bell?

215
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Thanatikarn?

216
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,880
- A politician?
- God!

217
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don’t you watch TV?

218
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,000
He’s related to Thames Tinnapat Thanatikarn,

219
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,790
a famous actor!

220
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,640
- A famous actor?
- Yes!

221
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
He is so famous!

222
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,350
- Everyone knows him.
- I don’t.

223
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,510
Have you living under a rock?

224
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Your client?

225
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,030
Yes.
I’m sure he’s a bit older than me.

226
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,880
He’s a chef
who just came back from Italy.

227
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,550
Hm.

228
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,750
Thames’s cousin is just like us,

229
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,510
but the difference is that
they don’t like each other.

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,960
Ah… is that so

231
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,880
And

232
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,240
is your actor 20 yet?

233
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,960
- He’s 23.
- Huh?

234
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,640
I don’t think he looks that young.

235
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,920
Comparing to you,

236
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,680
you look a lot younger than him.

237
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,350
Come on,that's too much

238
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,790
Do you ask
because you’re interested in him?

239
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,590
No!

240
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,400
You know I don’t like celebrities

241
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,510
or younger people.

242
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,830
And most importantly,

243
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,480
your actors aren’t my type.

244
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,830
You might get a younger boyfriend in a blink

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
I don’t think so.

246
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,920
So,

247
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,960
why are you smiling?

248
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,270
What a coincidence.

249
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,400
The food you ordered is Thames’s favorite.

250
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,550
This is why whenever I'm with him,

251
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
I feel like I’m with you.

252
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,030
You both aren’t picky,

253
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,640
but he’s a bit more stubborn.

254
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,240
Um..more stubborn

255
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,270
We finally meet,

256
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,200
Mon.

257
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,590
You got something on your lips.

258
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,880
What?

259
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,680
Food.
You eat like a child.

260
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Adults can be messy too.

261
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
I guess you’re right,

262
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,750
but kids are stubborn too.

263
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,480
We never know each other
Why does he act like we’re close?

264
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
Cute headband.

265
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,350
How was the event?

266
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,030
Everything’s fine.

267
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,830
Didn’t you talk to the organizer?

268
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,720
Why were you late?

269
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,270
I talked to the fans.

270
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,510
That’s why I’m late.

271
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
Good.

272
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,200
Don't forget that you're known because of them too.

273
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,480
Let me introduce you both.

274
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,070
This is Thames
and this is Mon.

275
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,640
As I said,
you two almost met several times.

276
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
I just realized I have to give you an amulet
before the end of this month.

277
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,960
That’s why we’re meeting today.

278
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,830
Oh, about that.

279
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,240
- Hey.
- Hm?

280
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,830
Give him the amulet.

281
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,550
Oh, I almost forgot.

282
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,000
You’ve been wearing that?

283
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,510
Yeah, I don’t want to lose it.

284
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,750
Nothing in return for bringing that to you?

285
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,440
Ask her.

286
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,550
But this is yours?

287
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,720
What do you want then?

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,160
What do I want?

289
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,550
Hm.

290
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,830
Let’s put that on the tab.
I’ll tell you what I want soon.

291
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,030
Wait.

292
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
This amulet

293
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,720
looks like mine.

294
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,110
It does.

295
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I actually love Thai Northern Sausages,

296
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,110
but since you love them too,

297
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,070
you can have them.

298
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,160
I’ll finish this if you’re slow.

299
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,640
In that case,
why don’t you pay this time?

300
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,550
Of course, I will.

301
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,880
Huh?

302
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,030
Seriously?

303
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,830
Let’s split the bill.

304
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,400
Come on. It's on me.

305
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,680
Hello?

306
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,070
Who’s that?

307
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes, sure.

308
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,030
Is everything alright?

309
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,680
Uh, I need to go.

310
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,110
My actress is having a problem
with a photographer.

311
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,510
I need to deal with that.

312
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,880
Angry Daisy, as always.

313
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,830
Just finish the dessert, and take a taxi to follow me.

314
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,480
Come on.
You know I hate taking taxis.

315
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,000
Mon,
can you please give Thames a lift home?

316
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,440
No problem.

317
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,880
Let me handle this

318
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,510
You can go ahead

319
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,830
Thank you so much.

320
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,030
Bye.

321
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,310
Hey, Mon.

322
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,590
Are you in a rush?

323
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,110
A bit.

324
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,310
Why?

325
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,790
Can we stop at a supermarket?

326
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,590
I need to buy lots of things.

327
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,350
Have some pork crackling too.

328
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,240
Let me help carry that.

329
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:15,030
Okay.
I’ll go see that aisle.

330
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,790
Sure.
I'll go after you

331
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,310
Let me help.

332
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:53,790
♫ You are the magic of my life. ♫

333
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,000
♫ I want to be next to you. ♫

334
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,680
♫ A fraction of a second of your smile ♫

335
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,920
♫ gives me an entire night's worth of good dreams. ♫

336
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
♫ I don’t know how I can stop my heart. ♫

337
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,160
♫ It’s like I’m bound by magic ♫

338
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,510
I’m buying this just in case.

339
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,880
Who buys these “just in case”?

340
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,590
I think it’s a good thing.

341
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,680
So I won't startled and lose my mood when it happen

342
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
Can you grab me
three more chocolate jars?

343
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,750
Sure.

344
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,480
Wow.
That's a lot

345
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,200
- You like chocolate?
- Yeah.

346
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
I do.

347
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,590
This isn’t chocolate, though.
It’s hazelnut mixed with cocoa.

348
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,960
Hm.

349
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,350
How many months are these for?

350
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,750
These only last a month.

351
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,000
What?

352
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,510
How about some bread?

353
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,000
No,
I think I still have some at home.

354
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,070
Anything else?

355
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,680
That’s everything.

356
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,640
Let’s head back.

357
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay.

358
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,790
Hey, Mon

359
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,000
What?

360
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,880
My grandma’s cooking is really good.

361
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,550
Why did you bring this up now?

362
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,350
I see that you buy lots of chocolate.
That’s not good for your health.

363
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,640
I eat something else too.

364
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
I’m just lazy to cook sometimes.

365
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,350
Come on.

366
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,270
If you got time,
come eat at my place.

367
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,920
Don't you ask your grandma?

368
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,790
She loves inviting people over for her food.

369
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,680
Trust me.
You will make her so happy.

370
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,790
Does that mean
you’ve invited lots of people before?

371
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,550
Yeah, but most are my friends.

372
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,310
Not once did I invite someone who’s not.

373
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,310
You’re likely the first.

374
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Let’s head out.

375
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,000
Hey, Mon

376
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,750
- What?
- Give me your phone.

377
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,510
- What for?
- Come on!

378
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,030
Quickly!

379
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,440
I added myself on Line.

380
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,310
Once you dropped me off
and you’re home, text me.

381
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,400
Let’s pay.

382
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,350
- I haven’t bought any milk or yogurt!
- That’s enough.

383
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,790
Let’s pay.
We’d like to pay.

384
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,920
That’s 800 baht.

385
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,680
Here.

386
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
Think of it as me paying for the gas.

387
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,510
Let’s go!
Don’t say anything else.

388
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,960
Quick!

389
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,030
Let’s head home, don't say anything.

390
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,110
Go home

391
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,590
Are you home?

392
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,070
Just arrived.

393
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,400
Good night, Mon.

394
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah.

395
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Good morning, Tuesday.

396
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,830
Are you that old?

397
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,680
If you’re smiling,
my trick is working.

398
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,110
My grandma loves sending these to me
every morning.

399
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,640
I think you’re cute.
No, I think it is cute.

400
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,480
So, I figured you might like it.

401
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,790
What are you doing right now?

402
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,070
Brushing.

403
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,270
Maybe you should finish brushing then

404
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,200
You can talk to me at any time.

405
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,350
I brought my phone to listen to music.

406
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,440
I’m in front of your house!
Come open the door.

407
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
What? Sing?

408
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,400
How did you come here?

409
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,790
How? A plane, a taxi,

410
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,030
walking, or running.
Any will do. Why?

411
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,000
Not like that.

412
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,350
What I meant is
why did you come here?

413
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,200
I called you yesterday

414
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,790
but you didn’t pick up.

415
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,550
So, I thought you were busy.

416
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,590
I didn’t plan to come at first,

417
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,030
but your mom worries
that you might only eat chocolate.

418
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,790
- So, she wants me to bring you food.
- Oh, god.

419
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,880
Is she afraid I’ll lose weight or what?

420
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,160
I haven’t even finished the food from last time.

421
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,720
- Eat more so you can gain more weight!
- Oh, god.

422
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,830
Hey, have you retrieved the amulet
from Bua’s actor?

423
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
Yeah, I got it yesterday.
Here.

424
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,720
That’s good.

425
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,480
Why did you have Thames bring it to me?

426
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,000
I told you I didn’t plan to come here.

427
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,070
So, it’s not about the food?

428
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,680
Make a guess.

429
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,960
What?

430
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,270
Our family isn’t concerned about food,

431
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,310
but I’m here because of the amulet that
given to you by the Venerable Grand Father.

432
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,400
This one?

433
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,160
Last month,
we visited him.

434
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,830
The Venerable Grand Father didn’t say anything,

435
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,830
but after a few days,
he told his follower to tell me

436
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,310
to give you this amulet
before the end of this month.

437
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,720
Huh?

438
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
Why before the end of this month?

439
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:19,920
And why giving two identical amulets?

440
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,830
I asked him, and all he said was that
it’s not the business of monks to say.

441
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,200
Aw.
That’s what he always says.

442
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,920
But I care about you,
that’s why I came.

443
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,400
Does this mean
I’ll be facing something soon?

444
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,030
Uh.

445
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,200
The Venerable Grand Father said
you’ll know soon why he gave you the amulet.

446
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,110
Soon?

447
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,680
Thames

448
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,790
Ton.

449
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,960
Uh..

450
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
how are you?

451
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,270
Not bad.

452
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,510
You’ve been back for a while?

453
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,160
Yeah.

454
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,670
I need to go.

455
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,030
Uh, excuse me.

456
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,630
Mon!
- Thames

457
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,960
What are you doing here?

458
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Buying bread.

459
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,150
You didn’t walk to this aisle yesterday
so I forgot.

460
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,360
What a coincidence.

461
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,000
I would rather call it destiny.

462
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,360
Nonsense.

463
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,550
Hello, Grandma.

464
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,280
Oh.

465
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,550
I’m talking to the guy
who gave me a lift yesterday.

466
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,710
Yeah, Mon.

467
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,510
You want to invite him over for a meal?

468
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,840
He said yes.

469
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,760
Sure, I’ll be back in a flash.

470
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,360
Yeah, see you.

471
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,190
You answer her before asking me?

472
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,760
Well,

473
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,710
it’s a nice gesture.

474
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,070
That’s not inviting.

475
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,480
You're twisting my arm

476
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,670
How am I going to say no?

477
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,110
Does that mean

478
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,960
you agree to come?

479
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,550
What? You agreed.

480
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,710
Mon.

481
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,110
- Grandma.
- Come for a hug.

482
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,480
Hello, Grandma
-This is Mon.

483
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,070
The guy I told you about.

484
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,110
Thank you for bringing Thames home
yesterday.

485
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,510
It’s okay.
Your home is on my way home.

486
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,230
I’m done arranging the table.
Please have a seat.

487
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,400
Yes.

488
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,110
These look so appetizing.

489
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,920
This one’s very good.

490
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,960
- I’ll try it.
- It really is.

491
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,000
Thames said you live in Bang Bua Thong?

492
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,320
Yes, Grandma.

493
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:53,320
It’s a bit far out,
but I love the place.

494
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,510
Are you an actor like Thames?

495
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,920
I’m not an actor.

496
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,590
I’m an interior designer.

497
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,360
You are smart.

498
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,840
I never know Thames has a friend in this field of work.

499
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,440
Most of his friends are actors.

500
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh.

501
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,190
Mon is Bua’s brother.

502
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,630
What?
We’re closer than I thought.

503
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,320
I meet her a lot.

504
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,840
She always mentions her little brother.
So it’s you.

505
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,800
What did she say about me?

506
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,590
She always says that you’re cute.

507
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,480
She’s always oversay like that.

508
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,710
I’m not that cute.

509
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,710
You’re much cuter in person.

510
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,230
That’s what I think.

511
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,230
See?

512
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,320
Let’s eat.

513
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
okay

514
00:37:55,030 --> 00:38:00,320
Mon, You're really not coming with me, are you?
-I said no.

515
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,440
Have you eaten anything?

516
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,550
I did.
Rice with an omelet.

517
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,960
A bit better than bread with spread.

518
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Don’t you need to go to work?

519
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,670
No, I’d rather talk to you.

520
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,590
Does that mean if I’m home early,

521
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,000
I can have rice with an omelet
at your place?

522
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,960
Stop it.
I’m going to bed.

523
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,760
You go to bed early!

524
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,030
go ahead then

525
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,280
I’ll text you when I’m home.

526
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,760
Is that everything?

527
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Yep.

528
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,920
I’m going to bed.

529
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,510
Good morning, everyone. This is Entertainment News Update

530
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,920
with the latest news updates to you.

531
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,510
Last night, the police received a report

532
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:33,880
of a white sedan,
registration number "3 K Y 4 5 4 4",

533
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,590
which lost control and hit a tree
on the bypass road.

534
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,110
Rescue workers and police rushed
to investigate the accident.

535
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,440
At the scene, they found
Mr. Tinnaphat Thanatikarn or Thames,

536
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,030
a famous actor, seriously injured

537
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,030
and trapped against the steering wheel.

538
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,840
Rescuers rushed to bring the young actor to the hospital.
