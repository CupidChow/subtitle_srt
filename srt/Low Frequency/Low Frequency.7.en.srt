00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,250
[Low Frequency]

3
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,289
There was a black car tailing him.

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,050
[Previously]

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,770
They were chasing each other.

6
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,690
The black car only stopped

7
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,750
after the white car lost balance.

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,210
Someone got off

9
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,710
and came over
to hit the white car’s driver with a rock

10
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,509
He even poured the alcohol over him.

11
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,420
How cruel.

12
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,030
Mark called and told me

13
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,840
that this document was sent
from the cloud storage.

14
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,490
Maybe the email was sent by Thames that day,

15
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,590
but the attempt was unsuccessful.

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,520
And yesterday,

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,860
Thames's phone was fixed.

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,030
That’s why the file was sent to Mark.

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,630
Later, Mark forwarded it to me.

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,180
Brother Mon.

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,960
I remember now.

22
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,350
The one who hurt me was...

23
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,990
Thanit.

24
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,370
You don't have to make yourself
sound so good.

25
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,440
Are you doing this
for the sake of your artists?

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,740
You're doing this
for your own gain, aren’t you?

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,340
I

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,110
gain something from it,

29
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,250
and you gain from it too.

30
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,060
It's a win-win situation.

31
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,820
-Hey! Who is it? -Oh, crap…

32
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,800
Can we do it again?

33
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,630
-No, that's enough.
-Come on.

34
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,030
That's enough.

35
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,990
Have you

36
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,579
thought about
what you’re going to do when you wake up?

37
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,360
Yes.

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,340
I thought of meditation, scuba diving,

39
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
tree planting, cooking,

40
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,490
tree planting… Eh, I already said that.

41
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,430
Uh...

42
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,250
I’ll watch a Disney movie.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,250
-I’ll join a rally and play golf.
-Okay. I got you.

44
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,420
The list is too long.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,120
Did you copy it from the advertisement?

46
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,010
Bingo.

47
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,750
But actually,

48
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,330
when I wake up,

49
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,780
I want to have ice cream with you.

50
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,110
I want to cook with you.

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,910
I want to eat with you.

52
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,030
And

53
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,540
I want to treat you to my grandma's cooking.

54
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,870
Well,

55
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,280
what do you want to do alone?

56
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,800
Hmm...

57
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,970
Ever since I met you,
I don't want to be alone anymore.

58
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,920
You’re shy.

59
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,450
Wow, it looks delicious.

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,900
Of course.
Would you look at who the chef is?

61
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,190
I'm not talking about food.

62
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,810
Hey, you’re being dirty.

63
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,030
Huh?

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,140
What's wrong, Brother Mon?

65
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,290
According to the police investigation,

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,080
the famous drama producer
and celebrity manager, Thanit,

67
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,290
might be related to human trafficking

68
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
and the online drug-selling cases
in the North.

69
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,680
The police headed

70
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,780
to search Thanit’s apartment.

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,800
But Thanit had fled

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,980
by the time they arrived.

73
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,380
Darn it.

74
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,610
Thanit.

75
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,240
Is my house that smelly?

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
No.

77
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,110
This is a weapon.

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,920
-A weapon? -Yeah.

79
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,540
Did you see the lighter in the bag?

80
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,000
-This one? -Yes.

81
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,630
If Thanit comes to you,

82
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,470
you can set him on fire.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,240
But I would have been gone

84
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,970
before I could find the lighter.

85
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,400
I have one more weapon. It's a handy one.

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,820
Oh, I saw it.

87
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,440
Wait.

88
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,660
Are you serious?

89
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,630
-An air gun? -Yes.

90
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,600
Do you want me to hold it, aim at him,
and pretend to shoot him? “Biu-biu”, like that?

91
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,510
Then he’ll be dead?

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,040
No.

93
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,420
It’s not to kill him,

94
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,030
but to scare him.

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,900
Aim at his eyes and shoot it
when there's a chance.

96
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
-Aim at his eyes? -Yeah.

97
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,910
Do you think I'm John Wick?

98
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,700
You make it sound so easy to hit the eye.

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
How about this? Take the spray bottle

100
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,720
and spray it into his eyes if he comes in.
It works the same. You’ll be safe.

101
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,760
-That’s how I should do it? -Yes.

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,960
If we’re attacking his eyes,
I can just get some chilli powder.

103
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
It hurts more that way.

104
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,360
But you already got
the chilli powder in your kitchen.

105
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,920
Trust me.

106
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,210
Be prepared, just in case.

107
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,800
Okay. Okay.

108
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,460
I'll listen to you.

109
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,270
Thank you.

110
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm happy to help, Brother Mon.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,909
Take care of yourself.

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,020
Take care of yourself.

113
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,640
-Take care of yourself, Brother Mon.
-I will.

114
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,240
-Okay? -I'll protect myself.

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,640
-Please protect yourself. I’m begging.
-Okay, I’ll protect myself.

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay. I got it.

117
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,520
What's wrong?

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
I think I saw something.

119
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,980
What?

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,890
Brother Mon.

121
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
There's a car in front of our house.

122
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,240
Hey.

123
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,940
Wait!

124
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,080
Brother Mon!

125
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,690
What are you doing, Brother Mon?

126
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,260
What?

127
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,860
I'm here to check on the car.

128
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,690
You can watch it from inside the house.
It's dangerous now.

129
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,930
Let me take you outside
and look at it closely.

130
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
There's nothing here.

131
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,190
You're exaggerating.

132
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,980
Come, let's get in.

133
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,500
Don't be scared.

134
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,090
-What? -What?

135
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,500
What's wrong, Mr. House Spirit?

136
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,030
I'm here to protect you.

137
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,660
I heard that someone is after you.

138
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,190
No one's after me. There's nothing.

139
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,800
-Then why are you here, uncle? -Huh?

140
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,520
Uncle? Is the man next door here too?

141
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,730
He's here.

142
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes, I asked him to come.

143
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,610
Then why did you ask him here?

144
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,160
Have you lost your memory?

145
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,950
I asked him to look after you.

146
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,890
What do you want him to do?

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,430
To choke the bad guy's neck?

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,910
Only ghosts in dramas
choke the bad guys’ necks.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,680
Right.

150
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,230
Then how are you two going to help?

151
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Uncle.

152
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,520
Please go home and sweep the floor.

153
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,670
Okay?

154
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,590
You too.

155
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,220
Please go home, Mr. House Spirit.

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,950
Please?

157
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,120
Okay?

158
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,420
They come and go quickly.

159
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,100
Hey.

160
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,800
Whose car is this?

161
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,660
Whose car is it?

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
-What? -Brother Mon!

163
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,530
-What are you doing here? -Mon! Mon!

164
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,240
Stay back!

165
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,310
Stop getting closer! Stop!

166
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,790
I told you to stay back!

167
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,860
Stop!

168
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,300
Hey, Mon!

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,790
What?

170
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,050
Stupid Pete?

171
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,060
So what's going on, Pete?

172
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm sorry, Mon.

173
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,420
I don't understand.

174
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,960
You told me not to worry about you, right?

175
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,170
But I couldn't help worrying about you.

176
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,600
That's why I asked my dad's henchmen
to guard your house.

177
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,790
So the two people in front of my house

178
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,330
are your father's henchmen?

179
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,220
Yes.

180
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,250
So…

181
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,140
Is your father a mob boss?

182
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,940
Didn’t I tell you before?

183
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,870
I thought you were joking.

184
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,170
Mon.

185
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,650
Have I ever lied to you?

186
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,940
Almost every time.

187
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,870
You

188
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,840
don’t make the truth
sound believable at all.

189
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,460
Seriously, who on earth

190
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,860
would think that I would joke about this?

191
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,220
Here, try to think from my point of view.

192
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,890
The friend who asked you
to buy pork skewers every day

193
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,240
suddenly told you
that he's the son of a mob boss.

194
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,740
Who would have believed that?

195
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,610
It’s Mark.

196
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,210
Hello.

197
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,530
I want to talk to you about Ai.

198
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,580
Ai?

199
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,010
Have you made up your mind?
Do you want to be exposed or do you want to help me?

200
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,760
You should know my answer.

201
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,400
Then what should I do?

202
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,110
I'll ask my dad
to help you flee the country.

203
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,290
Come to the dock tomorrow.

204
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,910
Okay.

205
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,680
Brother Mon.

206
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,440
Yes?

207
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,440
What will happen
if I don't return to my body?

208
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,840
Why do you ask?

209
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,500
If that's the case,

210
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,660
Grandma and Sister Bua

211
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,390
will be heartbroken.

212
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,340
But if you have to take the risk
to wake me up,

213
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,930
I can't accept it either.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,130
But if I'm safe alone

215
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,110
while you’re left unconscious,

216
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,070
it’s torture for me too.

217
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,630
Can you promise me

218
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,970
that you won't let yourself be in risk?

219
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,140
Just like what Brother Sing
and Sister Bua said.

220
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,290
Then have you ever listened to their words?

221
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,710
You should wake up, then.

222
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,590
Can you promise me?

223
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,740
Fine.

224
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,270
We'll settle the things with Thanit first.
After that, I'll wake up and be with you.

225
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,089
Brother Mon?

226
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,690
Brother Mon?

227
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,970
What's this?

228
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,130
Happy birthday.

229
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,810
Today is not my birthday.

230
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,360
Well,

231
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,820
we may not have time to celebrate tomorrow.

232
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,080
So we're celebrating it in advance.

233
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,940
Don't jinx it.

234
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,330
No, I mean...

235
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,060
We might be busy tomorrow. I have to take care of
things at the hospital when you wake up.

236
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,980
Mon.

237
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,810
I just woke up from a coma.

238
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,110
Why would I be discharged in such a hurry?

239
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,110
I don't know if you like it or not.

240
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,100
I like it as long as it’s from you.

241
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,650
Why don't you eat?

242
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,840
I want you to eat it first.

243
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,490
No.

244
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,480
Today is your birthday.

245
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,510
Since you’re a soul, you won't be able
to taste it even if I feed you.

246
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,490
You can feed me when you wake up tomorrow.

247
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,160
Okay.

248
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,370
Take a big bite.

249
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,470
It's really tasteless.

250
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,740
Tonight,

251
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,410
everything will be over.

252
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,500
Absolutely tasteless.

253
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,780
Where is the boat?

254
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,930
Ai.

255
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,280
Don’t you want to say goodbye to me?

256
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,280
No need.

257
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,620
Whatever.

258
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,600
Where is your dad's boat?

259
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,300
My dad has prepared a container for you.

260
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,720
Someone will pick you up tonight.

261
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,420
Where is it?

262
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,830
Ai is going to lure Thanit out by himself.

263
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,450
What do you think?

264
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,480
He volunteered
to help Thanit flee the country.

265
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,050
And he asked the police
to wait for Thanit at the dock.

266
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,080
Isn't that too dangerous?

267
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,420
That's why I'm here to discuss it with you.

268
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,050
Just say it if you want Mon
to be the bait instead of Ai.

269
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,310
Uh, who are you?

270
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,380
He's my friend, Pete.

271
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,060
Actually, I’m okay to do that.

272
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,000
But if I do it,

273
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,670
someone might be unhappy.

274
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,670
That’s right.

275
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,460
I can't let my friend take such a risk.

276
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,330
But...

277
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,960
I can't be the bait,

278
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,990
but I can help with something else.

279
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,760
Like what?

280
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,270
If the police get involved,

281
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,470
they might be able
to make in time if they are lucky.

282
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,200
But if they're late,

283
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,310
Thanit could have escaped.

284
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,550
You know that Thanit has many informants.

285
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,830
If luck is not on our side,

286
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,910
and someone tell him
about our plan beforehand,

287
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,200
then our plan will be ruined.

288
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,150
Then what should I do?

289
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,540
It’s almost here.

290
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,820
How did you know?

291
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,410
My little ghost told me secretly.

292
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,430
Hey, I'm not a ghost.

293
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,840
Don't kill him.

294
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,950
Do you understand?

295
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,610
We just need to catch him
and hand him over to the police.

296
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,980
Yes, boss.

297
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,620
Let's go.

298
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,590
Where is the boat?

299
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,440
You lied to me!

300
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,310
Hey, Ai!

301
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,410
Hey, stop!

302
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,480
Where are you going?

303
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,180
Just give up, Brother Thanit,

304
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,780
for all the years
we've been working together.

305
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,590
You wish!

306
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,210
Hey.

307
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,660
Give me the car key!

308
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,090
Oh.

309
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,990
Give me the key.

310
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,070
Hurry!

311
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,770
Hey, Mon!

312
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,950
Let go! Let go!

313
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,840
Thames!

314
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,130
Thames, what's wrong?

315
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,700
Thames! Thames!

316
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,980
What's wrong?

317
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,620
Thames, what's wrong?

318
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,870
Thames, what's wrong?

319
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,910
-Help! Help! -Thames! Thames!

320
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,950
What's wrong?

321
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
Thames!

322
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,010
What's wrong?

323
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,270
-Thames, what's wrong? -Grandma, this way.

324
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,130
What's wrong?

325
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,400
The patient has no pulse. Start CPR.

326
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,530
Mon!

327
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,660
Let go!

328
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,750
Mon!

329
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,530
Brother Mon!

330
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,590
Mon! Mon!

331
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,530
Are you okay? Where were you hit?

332
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,570
I'm fine.

333
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,140
It's just a scratch.

334
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,000
Then why did you lie down? You scared me!

335
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,770
It hurts.

336
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,500
Are you okay?

337
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,780
I'm glad you're okay.

338
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:15,570
I'll take care of Thanit
and hand him over to the police first.

339
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,990
I'll be back soon. Just wait for a while.

340
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,250
Okay? Just a moment.

341
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,180
Thames!

342
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,590
It’s Sister Bua.

343
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,190
Ah.

344
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,260
It's okay, Ai. The ambulance is on the way.

345
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,370
I’m sorry, Mark.

346
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,740
For what?

347
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,860
Everything.

348
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,490
I know I've done a lot of bad things
that make things difficult for you.

349
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,090
It’s Okay, Ai.

350
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,600
You can always put me
in a difficult position.

351
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,450
But please, don't go anywhere.

352
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,940
Stay and keep making things
difficult for me.

353
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,110
Ai.

354
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,120
Stay strong.

355
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,910
Hold your breath.

356
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,260
Brother Mon!

357
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,990
Thames.

358
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,980
You are...

359
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,700
I'm not Nay. I'm Guy.

360
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,720
Guy?

361
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,920
I’m the Guy you're thinking about.

362
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,980
Are you talking about Guy,
that friend of Brother Mon?

363
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,850
Yes, that’s me.

364
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,750
And I’m also your brother, Guy.

365
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,370
I don't understand.

366
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,600
What's going on, uncle?

367
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,750
Hey.

368
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,290
Brother Guy.

369
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,449
I'm glad

370
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,350
to hear you call me brother.

371
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,190
And...

372
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,620
I’s nice to officially meet you, Thames.

373
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,929
Wait, you're Brother Guy?

374
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,360
My half-brother?

375
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,030
And also Brother Mon’s friend
who passed away?

376
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,010
That’s right.

377
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,650
Stop being confused.

378
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,739
Now you should understand

379
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,790
why our fates

380
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,010
are intertwined.

381
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,770
Wait.

382
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,650
Wait, uncle.

383
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,969
Wait a minute.

384
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,430
Well...

385
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,230
How is it? I can't keep up.

386
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,520
Do you remember
what the Venerable Grand Father told you?

387
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,780
Yeah.

388
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,590
He said that someone will be here
to help the two of you.

389
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,910
And that's me.

390
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,510
I knew it from the beginning.

391
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,230
You two are blessed to meet each other.

392
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,470
But you need to go through something

393
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,570
before that day comes.

394
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,210
So you’re the one who has been helping me

395
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,140
after my soul left my body

396
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,580
and when my fate reached its end?

397
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,950
If you’ve been helping me,

398
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,790
why would you become Mr. House Spirit?

399
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,370
When I was ten, my fate wasn't over yet.

400
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,310
That's why the Venerable Grand Father
told me to stay with Mon.

401
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,410
And when the time comes, I can reincarnate.

402
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,440
I think it's a good chance to look after Mon

403
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,350
if I can stay as Mr. House Spirit.

404
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:27,070
But I can't let anyone know who I am.

405
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,380
So that’s why you speak in the old language.

406
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,770
Yup. I speak it fluently, right?

407
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,600
Though I say so,

408
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,150
but I’ve been secretly hoping
that Mon will sense something.

409
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,880
Oh, then...

410
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,180
What about his dream?

411
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,220
I didn't enter his dream.

412
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,140
He was the one who couldn’t let it go,

413
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,790
and kept blaming himself for it.

414
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,910
Actually, I want to go into his dream
and talk to him.

415
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,320
To warn him about the bad things
that will happen soon.

416
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,600
But I can't.

417
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,860
Because this is the rule of fate.

418
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:28,660
I don't understand.
Then why are you so worried about him?

419
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,820
Because he's my only friend.

420
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,460
He was the only friend

421
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,340
who could put a smile again
on the 10-year-old kid

422
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,790
who had been hurt

423
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,930
by his broken family.

424
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,750
But I'm here,

425
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,260
not just because I'm worried about Mon.

426
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,740
At that time, I knew
that Mom was going to remarry.

427
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,060
And I was going to have a younger brother.

428
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,640
Unfortunately,

429
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,760
I didn't get to see him.

430
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,720
I…

431
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,200
Left ahead.

432
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,040
If I had no worries for you,

433
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,350
I would have been reborn.

434
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,840
Brother Guy.

435
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,720
I've completed my mission.

436
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,850
From now on,

437
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,980
take care of Mon for me.

438
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,800
Aren't you going
to say goodbye to Mon yourself?

439
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,400
I would love to.

440
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,380
But only one person can get out of here.

441
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,030
I've violated many rules because of you

442
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,780
since I’ve been on the verge of death.

443
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,720
I have to go, Thames.

444
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,780
Wait, brother, the chat was too short.

445
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,090
I promise you, one day

446
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,240
we’re going to meet again.

447
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,560
Until that day comes,

448
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,750
you must try your best to be happy.

449
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,750
One more thing.

450
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,770
You’re a grown-up now.
Stop being afraid of ghosts.

451
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,390
From now on, I’m no longer around
when you are afraid of ghosts.

452
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,730
Brother Guy.

453
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,350
Why are you crying?

454
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,510
They are tears of joy.

455
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,010
At least in this life,

456
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,670
I got to spend some time with you

457
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,500
as your brother.

458
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,780
Also, please tell Mom that I miss her.

459
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,850
Happy birthday, my little brother.

460

[In the next episode]

461
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,890
Have you heard of it?

462
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,710
It's said that when people die,

463
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,920
they become these stars.

464
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,120
When I look at them, I wonder

465
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,020
where I should stay when I die.

466
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,300
If that's the case,

467
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,600
you don't have to wait
until you become a star.

468
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,680
Because

469
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,330
you have me now.

470
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,190
What's going on, Mon?

471
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,920
Well...

472
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,710
I promised you before, remember?

473
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,670
I brought my boyfriend here.

474
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,060
Are you Mon's boyfriend?

475
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,260
Uh...

476
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,860
Yes, I'm his boyfriend.

477
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,970
Brother Mon.

478
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,090
Yes?

479
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,350
-Thank you. -Okay.

480
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,640
Are we going to the bathroom
to brush our teeth?

481
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,770
It's okay. It comes with a cup.

482
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,430
Here.

483
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,130
It's cool.

484
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, there's no bathroom.

485
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,800
What did you say?

486
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,590
Every day with you. Every day with Dr. Ray.
