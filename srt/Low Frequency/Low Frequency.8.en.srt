[Previously]

4
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,060
What will happen
if I don't return to my body?

5
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,960
If that's the case,

6
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,100
Grandma and Sister Bua

7
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,690
will be heartbroken.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,770
But if you have to take the risk
to wake me up,

9
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,509
I can't accept it either.

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,640
But if I'm safe alone

11
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,570
while you stay unconscious,

12
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,509
I’ll be sad too.

13
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,300
Let go of me!

14
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,480
-What's wrong with you, Thames?
-Excuse me, please.

15
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
Patient! Patient!

16
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,250
-What's wrong?
-The patient has no pulse, start CPR.

17
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,570
Thames.

18
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,590
Brother Mon.

19
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,300
Why are you hugging me?

20
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,520
You...

21
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,780
What can you remember?

22
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,840
I

23
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,220
went to the wrap-up party.

24
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,050
Then I had an accident.

25
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,790
And then?

26
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,160
Then

27
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,770
my soul went out of my body,

28
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,320
and I appeared in your house.

29
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,430
You scared me. You think that’s funny?

30
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,400
Don't leave me again.

31
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,980
Okay, I won't.

32
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,550
Thames.

33
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,660
-Thames -Thames!

34
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,170
Grandma.

35
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,150
Sister Bua.

36
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,480
Let's check out the big news
that has been making the rounds lately.

37
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,659
Around 12 a.m. yesterday,

38
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,750
the police received an important clue

39
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,590
regarding the scandalous drama producer
and celebrity manager, Thanit.

40
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,620
He is suspected to be directly involved with the accident

41
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,540
that happened to the famous young actor,
Thames Thinnaphat.

42
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,930
He might also be related to human trafficking
and the online drug-dealing network.

43
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,020
An anonymous report was made to the police

44
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,580
that he planned to flee the country.

45
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,130
That's why they helped arrest Thanit

46
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,010
and handed him over to the police.

47
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,130
He deserves it.

48
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,570
Karma is real.

49
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,570
I hope he rots in prison.

50
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,820
Calm down, grandma.
Otherwise, your blood pressure will rise again.

51
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,900
How can I calm down?

52
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,659
He's lucky that I wasn’t there.

53
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,420
If I were there, he would have suffered.

54
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,210
That’s right. If my grandma were there,
he would have been gone!

55
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,690
He would have died long ago.

56
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,020
It makes me sick.

57
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,650
How did he survive until now?

58
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,770
Amitabha.
I hope the Karma goes harsh on him.

59
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,370
He deserves it.
Are you sure this is enough for him?

60
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,640
But it's strange.

61
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,470
He was arrested right after you woke up.

62
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,970
The retribution came just in time.

63
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,540
That's right, Grandma.
The retribution came just in time.

64
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,700
Yeah.

65
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,060
But I think it’s a bit late.
He should be punished sooner.

66
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,380
If I catch him, I'll devour him.

67
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,520
How dare he lay his hand on my grandson?

68
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,010
-Eat up, kid. Eat up. -Alright.

69
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,610
-Eat a lot. -Okay, Grandma.

70
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,720
Look how skinny you are.

71
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,310
Hey, Mon. Let's go shopping.

72
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,600
-Okay. -We'll be right back.

73
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,620
We’ll come back later.

74
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,580
I can't trust people these days.

75
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,490
Let me feed you.

76
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,250
-It's okay, Grandma. -Let me feed you.

77
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,610
You've lost too much weight.
When you were sick,

78
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,380
-Okay. -I couldn't eat or sleep.

79
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,730
Eat up.

80
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,450
Look how skinny you are, my baby.

81
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,780
-Look. There are only bones left. Goodness.
-Yes.

82
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,850
I can't sleep and eat.

83
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,700
-But you’re still so handsome. -Right.

84
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,970
My grandson is always so good-looking.

85
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,690
-Grandma, you always tell the truth.
-Eat up.

86
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,790
What’s up with Thames?

87
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,110
Uh...

88
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,730
Explain it to me.

89
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,770
Well,

90
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,020
it's what you understand.

91
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,580
Thames and I,

92
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,580
we’re dating.

93
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
I knew it.

94
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,490
Actually, I have no problem with Thames
dating anyone he wants.

95
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,450
But I'm more worried about you.

96
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,750
Worried about me?

97
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,810
Why?

98
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,560
Is Thames a playboy?

99
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,500
No, it’s about his fans.

100
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,560
But

101
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,470
he said

102
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,430
his fans will accept it.

103
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,550
But no matter what, there are people who can accept it
and people who can't.

104
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,110
Be careful.

105
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,770
Okay, Sister Bua.

106
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,720
That's all I can remind you.

107
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,690
The rest is between you two.

108
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,460
Please love each other nicely.

109
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,130
If Thames doesn't treat you well,
tell me right away.

110
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,600
I'll take care of him myself.

111
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,000
Copy that, Ms. Manager.

112
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,210
Good.

113
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,980
I'll tell you right away.

114
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,750
Actually,

115
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,420
Guy had always been here.

116
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,390
Yeah.

117
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,420
He asked me
to tell you to stop blaming yourself.

118
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,980
I'm quite disappointed

119
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,820
that I can't see
Mr. House Spirit when I’m home now.

120
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,980
Yeah.

121
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,100
I did a merit
for the uncle next door last night.

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,810
-The uncle next door? -Yes.

123
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,250
I made it for you.

124
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,420
I did a good deed for you, uncle.

125
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,650
Please sweep the floor carefully, okay?

126
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,740
Will he kick me?

127
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,620
Let's go home.

128
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,210
-Let's go. -Let's go.

129
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,990
Why are you standing there?

130
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,950
Waiting for you.

131
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,740
Waiting for my permission to come in?

132
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,170
No, I'm waiting for you to pack up.

133
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,160
Pack up? For what?

134
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,260
-Pack up your clothes. -Why?

135
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,170
-Pack up my clothes? -Yes.

136
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,300
Where are we going?

137
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Well,

138
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,290
to the place we promised.

139
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,580
It's delicious.

140
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,810
Didn't Sister Bua tell you
to control your diet?

141
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah.

142
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,600
I don't care about abs.

143
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,970
I have to make up for what I’ve been missing
when I get the chance.

144
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,380
-Wow, it's so delicious.
-Can you finish all that?

145
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,530
Can I have the menu, please?

146
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,050
Thank you.

147
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,450
I want this, this, and this.

148
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,340
-Thank you.
-Hey.

149
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,170
That's enough. You already have a lot here,
and you still want to order more?

150
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,940
Oh, brother. I almost had no chance
to eat ice cream again in this life.

151
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,250
Of course I’m going to eat as much as I can.

152
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,240
What?

153
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,720
If you keep eating like this, I promise

154
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,690
-that it won't take long.
-It won't take long for what?

155
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,100
That you won't be eating ice cream
for the rest of your life.

156
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,240
So,

157
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,720
it means I can still eat it today.

158
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,040
It's delicious.

159
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,000
Delicious.

160
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,730
No!

161
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,150
Brother Mon, I got dirty!

162
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,020
That's enough.

163
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,360
Ah.

164
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,570
Mon, oh Mon!

165
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,170
If you come back, I won't ask you
to buy me pork skewers anymore.

166
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Okay.

167
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,380
Wow.

168
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,880
Ever since I was born, I've never seen
anyone eat so much ice cream.

169
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,490
It’s not that much.

170
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,840
Are we going home?

171
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,120
Wait, brother.

172
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,140
I didn't ask you to pack up for ice cream.

173
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,010
Then

174
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,200
where are we going?

175
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,830
Chiang Mai.

176
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,810
Chiang Mai?

177
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,420
Yes, we made a promise, remember?

178
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
If I can return to my body,
we’ll go there again together.

179
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,520
Well, I remember that promise.

180
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,610
But why are you in such a hurry?

181
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,430
Because I won't be free later.

182
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,820
What about my job?

183
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,520
If I sneak out like this, I’ll be in trouble.
There must be a lot of problems.

184
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,510
Don't worry. I’ve settled it for you.

185
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,750
What's wrong?

186
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,870
What's wrong?

187
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,550
What?

188
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,180
Are you okay?

189
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,550
I told you not to eat too much.

190
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,610
And you insisted to order more.

191
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,410
-Stop it. -Goodness.

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,520
The lemon sorbet is so green.

193
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,980
Are you good?

194
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,109
Are you feeling better?

195
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,230
Brother Mon!

196
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,400
-I'll sing with you. -Sure.

197
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,430
Sing it.

198
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,410
Let's sing that song together.

199
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,130
Leave it to me.

200
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,370
-I'll start first. -Okay.

201
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,270
Here we go.

202
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:57,020
♫You turn every gloomy day
into a bright day♫

203
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,780
♫Your voice
is like a song echoing in my heart♫

204
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,880
Is it awkward?

205
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:07,910
Not bad.

206
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,010
♫My heart melts every time I see you♫

207
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,860
These lyrics are mine.

208
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,610
♫It seems to melt in your eyes ♫

209
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,250
♫It's like I'm bound by magic♫

210
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,610
♫I give my heart to you♫

211
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,730
♫I just want you to know
that you make me feel like sunshine♫

212
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:36,500
♫You make the whole world smile♫

213
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,890
♫You are the magic in my life♫

214
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,910
♫I want to get close to you, darling♫

215
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,500
♫Just a few seconds of your smile♫

216
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,210
♫Made me have a good dream all night♫

217
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,820
♫I don't know how to control my heart♫

218
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,010
♫Like I’m controlled by magic♫

219
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:12,210
♫Baby, being with you
makes my whole day meaningful♫

220
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,210
♫I don’t want a sunrise,
I just want to see your eyes♫

221
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,220
♫My heart melts every time I see you♫

222
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,730
♫It seems to melt in your eyes ♫

223
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,220
♫It's like I'm bound by magic♫

224
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,460
♫I give my heart to you♫

225
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,210
♫I just want you to know
that you make me feel like sunshine♫

226
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,740
♫You make the whole world smile♫

227
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:55,220
♫You are the magic in my life♫

228
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,250
♫I want to get close to you, darling♫

229
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,820
♫Just a few seconds of your smile♫

230
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,380
♫Made me have a good dream all night♫

231
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,970
♫I don't know how to control my heart♫

232
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,090
♫Like I’m controlled by magic♫

233
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,560
What?

234
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,590
It's nice.

235
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,100
Of course.
It’s because you’re singing with me.

236
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,590
Do you want to know my plan?

237
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,220
This...

238
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,510
-What is this? -Take a look.

239
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,830
First,

240
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,190
eat ice cream until I’m satisfied.

241
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,320
Second,

242
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,130
drive Brother Mon to Chiang Mai.

243
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,630
Third,

244
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,320
sing with Mon while he plays his guitar.

245
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,590
If that's the case,

246
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,710
I'll add the fourth plan.

247
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,410
What is the fourth plan?

248
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,070
I'll tell you tomorrow.

249
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,710
What's taking you so long?

250
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,220
Just wait.

251
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,290
Okay, fine.

252
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,920
You'll know tomorrow.

253
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,250
I want to know right now.

254
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,780
Just wait.

255
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,930
But there must be a fourth plan.

256
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,140
So this is your plan?

257
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,650
Yes.

258
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,640
You can go back if you can't do it.

259
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,550
No. I won’t go back no matter what.

260
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,000
You're already part of my family.

261
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,100
And I want to be a part of your family too.

262
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,900
Your body is a slave to your mind.

263
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,110
If you're scared, grab my hand.

264
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,500
Brother Sing, don't scare Thames.

265
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,330
I didn't do anything.

266
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,570
So what's going on?

267
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,120
It's our promise, remember?

268
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,480
I brought my boyfriend to make it public.
This is my boyfriend.

269
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,460
Are you Mon's boyfriend?

270
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,610
Uh...

271
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,530
Yes, I'm Brother Mon's boyfriend.

272
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,400
Brother Sing.

273
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,430
If you keep scaring Thames,

274
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,370
I'll get mad.

275
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,210
I’m just playing around, and you already get angry?
Did you learn that from mom?

276
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,770
Then how is my boyfriend, Brother Sing?

277
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:18,950
Did he pass the test?

278
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,690
I met him before.

279
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,170
I’ll let him pass. He's handsome.

280
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,040
But isn't a celebrity like him a playboy?

281
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,930
Brother Sing, I can swear whatever you want.
I’ll only have Brother Mon.

282
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,510
No need to swear.

283
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,680
I'll ask Bua to keep an eye on you 24/7.

284
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,840
No problem.

285
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,060
Trust me, brother.

286
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,040
I chose the right person.

287
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,830
This is the first time
I've heard you say that.

288
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,990
And it should be the last time.

289
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,990
Let's eat.

290
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,280
Don’t be shy. Make yourself at home.

291
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,740
But why were you so mean
to him in the first place?

292
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,630
I didn't know if he's good or not.

293
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,380
-Alright. -Let's eat.

294
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,860
I'll scoop it for you.

295
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,540
Thank you.

296
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,090
For what?

297
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,660
Is it

298
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,880
about me helping you return to your body?

299
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,780
That too...

300
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,270
But...

301
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,880
I thought about it.

302
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,220
I want to thank you for everything.

303
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,390
Well...

304
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,340
You always find a chance to tease me.

305
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,100
I'm telling the truth.

306
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,540
Before I met you,

307
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,820
all my life was work, work, and work,

308
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,550
then I went home to sleep.

309
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,560
But after I met you,

310
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,170
I started thinking

311
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,310
that I want to do something like this

312
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,410
and live like this.

313
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,060
Also,

314
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,630
I want to be this happy.

315
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,640
You’re in the honeymoon period.

316
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,260
I guess so.

317
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,860
Well,

318
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,400
when will it end?

319
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,630
When

320
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,960
you cancel it.

321
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,780
Come on, otherwise you'll get sick.

322
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,660
When I look at these stars,

323
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,840
it's like seeing some sample houses.

324
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,930
What do you mean?

325
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,500
Have you heard of it?

326
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,510
I heard that when people die,

327
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,640
they become these stars.

328
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,840
When I look at them, I wonder

329
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,760
where I should go when I die.

330
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,600
I think...

331
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,220
I want to be there.

332
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,760
There are many shining stars around.

333
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,360
What about you?

334
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,350
Me?

335
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,780
I want to be somewhere with you.

336
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,740
In that case,

337
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,000
you don't have
to wait until you become a star.

338
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:11,960
Because

339
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
you already have me by your side.

340
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,000
You’re right.

341
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,270
It's nice.

342
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,370
Yeah.

343
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,990
It’s too good.

344
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,020
What’s wrong with that?

345
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,200
Well,

346
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,570
what will happen if things aren’t that great

347
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,190
one day?

348
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,740
Don't think too much.

349
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,510
It's because you work
in the entertainment industry.

350
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,620
If you get tired of me,

351
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,910
and cheat on me,

352
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,670
what should I do?

353
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,850
I promise you, that won't happen.

354
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,360
I'm sick of my boyfriend.

355
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,530
But you already have a boyfriend.

356
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,130
Will it be better if we talk

357
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,760
after you break up?

358
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,850
I'll be single in a few days.

359
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,190
Why should I waste my time?

360
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,820
Cut.

361
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,970
Good take.

362
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,890
Let's call it a day.

363
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,900
-We’re done. Pack your stuff and let’s go home.
-Thank you.

364
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,620
-Thank you. -Bye.

365
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,100
-It's finally over. -You're amazing.

366
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,370
What do you think? You’re finally
playing the lead together.

367
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,630
Are you satisfied?

368
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,400
Playing the lead together? I don't think so.

369
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,550
A lead is a lead.

370
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,430
Thames, where are you going later?

371
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,370
Why? Are you buying me a drink?

372
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,460
Yes.

373
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,300
I'm busy. Sorry.

374
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,450
You should drink less.
Your liver is so stiff that it’s about to break into pieces.

375
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,500
-Alright. -I’m leaving with Ai.

376
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,050
-Okay, see you. -Bye.

377
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,560
I'll go change and get my bag.

378
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,250
-Bye. -Bye.

379
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,010
Good job. Especially the highlight.

380
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,300
I'm good at every scene, right?

381
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,740
Yes. Actually, today's work is over.

382
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,610
Why did you tell Mark that you're busy?

383
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,430
I want them to spend some time alone.

384
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,780
-Let's go home. Go change your clothes.
-Let's go. I'm so tired today.

385
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,930
Let's go.

386
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,050
That was so well acted.

387
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,170
Thank you.

388
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,570
You're not like this
when you're with me, though.

389
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,410
Are you jealous?

390
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,270
No.

391
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,210
I'm not that unreasonable.

392
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,770
Are you jealous of me or Thames?

393
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,430
You’re jealous of Thames, I guess.

394
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,140
You punk.

395
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,160
Do you want something
stronger than that tonight?

396
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,160
You’re so dirty.

397
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,540
Let's go. Hurry up.

398
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,090
-Hello. -Goodness.

399
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,239
You scared me.

400
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,880
You're back early.

401
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,489
I'm afraid someone will miss me.

402
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,929
Well...

403
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,500
If you don't tease me,
you won't be able to sleep, right?

404
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,679
Hey.

405
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,750
What are you watching?

406
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:51,420
It's the drama you played with Mark.
It's the first episode today.

407
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,820
Don't you remember?

408
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,880
I forgot.

409
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,929
Come on, let's watch it together.

410
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,840
I'll be single in a few days.

411
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,210
Why should I waste my time?

412
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,310
Why did you turn it off?

413
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm shy.

414
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,300
Why would you? Give me the remote control.

415
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,770
I want to keep watching.

416
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,390
Give it to me.

417
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,910
You know that, right?

418
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,410
I have no right to refuse.

419
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,230
What are you doing?

420
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,450
You don't have
to play a live performance for me.

421
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,240
Brother, I won't sleep here tonight.

422
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,570
Why?

423
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,390
I have an important job tomorrow.

424
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,440
What about our date tonight?

425
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,690
I'll pick you up.

426
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,420
I won't forget our Valentine's Day dinner.

427
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,940
Okay, that will work.

428
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,240
I thought we could sleep together tonight.

429
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh, don't be mad.

430
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,660
I'll pick you up on time.

431
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,340
-Don't be mad. -Okay.

432
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,920
You can continue watching.

433
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,930
Brother Mon.

434
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,970
Yes?

435
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,930
This is your second life,

436
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,530
and also my second life.

437
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,760
I don't know if the world
will give us a third life.

438
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,640
So...

439
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,750
I don't want to wait anymore.

440
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,510
Is your heart racing?

441
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,560
Mine too.

442
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,290
I like it so much

443
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,340
when we can feel each other's heart.

444
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,350
Brother Mon.

445
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,570
Yes?

446
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,420
Can you stay and listen to my heart

447
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,130
until it stops beating?

448
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,180
Yes.

449
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,810
-It’s so pretty. -Yeah.

450
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,900
-Let's go. -Let's go.

451
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,900
Are you tired after driving for so long?

452
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,400
No, it was easy.

453
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,680
By the way,

454
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,690
it's quite cold today.

455
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,000
Are you cold?

456
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,390
Give me your hand.

457
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,090
Look. Rub it like this.

458
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,970
Do you feel better?

459
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,100
-I feel much better. Come with me. -Wait.

460
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,270
Oh, it really warms up.

461
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,320
Keep rubbing.

462
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:10,640
♫You turn every gloomy day
into a bright day♫

463
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:19,750
♫Your voice
is like a song echoing in my heart♫

464
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:30,070
♫My heart melts every time I see you,
it seems to melt in your eyes♫

465
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:38,910

I give my heart to you♫

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,740

♫I want to get close to you, darling,
just a few seconds of your smile♫

470
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,800
♫Made me have a good dream all night♫

471
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:13,330
♫I don't know how to control my heart♫

472
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:16,900
♫Like I’m controlled by magic♫

473
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:25,080
♫Baby, being with you

474
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:32,670

♫I want to get close to you, darling,
just a few seconds of your smile♫

481
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,530
A soul is a low-frequency wave.

482
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,770
It's so low
that it's invisible to humans eyes.

483
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,870
I, Mon Manayu Woraphat,

484
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:30,010
can sense low-frequency waves, and see souls.

485
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,720
This also allows me

486
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,400
to be attracted and to meet with

487
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,100
a low-frequency wave
called Thames Tinnaphat Thanatikarn.

488
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,360
I should thank the low-frequency waves
that I never wanted

489
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,900
to see.

490
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,440
It allows us
to own each other, like we do today.

491
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:01,100
And even though we lost our ability
to sense low-frequency waves,

492
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,850
along with our heartbeats that are beating

493
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,860
at the same pace,

494
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,940
a promise is ringing.

495
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,910
The words of love

496
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,620
are dancing, full of emotions.

497
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,260
I might not be able to see it
with my naked eyes.

498
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,890
It's like a low-frequency wave.

499
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,820
We can only find it
through scientific equipment.

500
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:30,630
But

501
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,540
when it comes to love,

502
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,090
we should use

503
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,440
the device called "heart",

504
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,250
and feel it in person.

505
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,700
[Low Frequency]
