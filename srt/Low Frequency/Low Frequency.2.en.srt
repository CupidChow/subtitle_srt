Thames.

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,300
Thank you, Mon.

12
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,570
How is it? Are you okay?

13
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,480
Yes.

14
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,940
Is this grilled pork skewers?

15
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,340
Hey, why didn't you tell me if it was about this?

16
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,910
I'll pay you right now.

17
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,850
I said it's okay.

18
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,800
It'd be bad if it was about the skewers.

19
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,980
How long have we been friends?

20
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,540
I can tell something's wrong just by the way you walk.

21
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,040
How about this?

22
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,420
Tell me who did you wrong.

23
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,920
I'll take care of it.

24
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,660
Did you see the news?

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
About Thames' accident.

26
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,340
It's not true. He's not that kind of person.

27
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,000
He's not that kind of person.

28
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,980
Let me guess.

29
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,460
Is it because of the accident?

30
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,120
Thames is safe now. I'm busy. Let's talk later.

31
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,220
Yes, that's it.

32
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,200
Thames is Sister Bua's artist.

33
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,579
I don't know him well.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,430
But I was shocked when I heard the news.

35
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,510
Just acquaintances

36
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,430
could make you this upset?

37
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,500
I think the two of you are more than that.

38
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,380
I've only known him for 3 days.

39
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,160
We aren't that close.

40
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,740
And you're so sad when you just met him 3 days ago?

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,120
I was smashed by a woman with a glass bottle, and I'm already dying.

42
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,150
Why are you laughing at me?

43
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,560
You deserve it.

44
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,990
A scumbag like you needs a lesson.

45
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,980
You're so petty.

46
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,020
Keep being petty. I'm leaving.

47
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,630
I have a meeting with my client.

48
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,570
I'll talk to you later.

49
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:33,980
Hey, hey, hey!

50
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,340
You're leaving me like this? Mon!

51
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,860
Mon!

52
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,680
Hey!

53
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,240
This is

54
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,940
what I told you before.

55
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,260
I hope the room has a modern vibe,

56
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,630
according to the reference information sent to Mr. Yak's before.

57
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,980
Oh, he has sent it to me.

58
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,970
But I need to discuss some details with you first.

59
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,420
That's great.

60
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,380
I want the job to complete soon.

61
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,830
One more thing.

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,420
If I confirm it,

63
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,500
then you can speed up the refurbishment. Do you have any problems?

64
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,220
I have no problems.

65
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,940
But the previous schedule was already in a hurry.

66
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,060
Why do you want it to go faster?

67
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,330
Because I went to see the fortune teller.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
He said I've been surrounded by luck lately.

69
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,620
Anything I do, I have to do quickly.

70
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,570
I didn't believe it at first.

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,580
But after thinking about it,

72
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,330
I think many good things are coming to me.

73
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,140
Good things?

74
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,220
For example, I've met an excellent interior designer like you.

75
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,390
I don't think I'm that good, though.

76
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,900
A drunk driver is terrible. He's a troublemaker #StarTT

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:36,159
According to the insiders, Thames drank a lot at the party. #StarTT

78
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,030
Unfollow. It's not good to get drunk and drive. #StarTT

79
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm disappointed. I've been following him for a long time. I didn't know he'd be like that. #StarTT

80
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,659
Where's the manager? Why is she not taking good care of him? #StarTT

81
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,340
Hello, Brother Sing.

82
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,530
Are you up?

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,860
Yes, I've been up for a while.

84
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,870
What's wrong?

85
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,420
I met Bua last night.

86
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,690
At the hospital?

87
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,270
Yes, do you remember the boy that I asked to pass you the amulet necklace, Thames?

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Yes, I remember, brother.

89
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,880
What's wrong?

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,020
That kid is still unconscious.

91
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
What did the doctor say?

92
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,080
That's why I'm calling you.

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,010
Why?

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,680
The doctor said there was no physical damage,

95
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,490
but he is still in a coma after 5 days.

96
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,770
Don't you think it's just like what happened to you before?

97
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,850
He was like me 18 years ago.

98
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,960
That's right.

99
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,570
I really don't want you to get involved in this.

100
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,240
Because it has nothing to do with us.

101
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,780
But seeing Bua like this makes me very upset.

102
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
I don't know if you can help.

103
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,710
If you feel uneasy, you don't have to worry about it.

104
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,500
I'm just telling you.

105
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,280
Okay, brother.

106
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,800
Be careful.

107
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,560
Take it back, kid.

108
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,850
It's okay, Grandma. I'd be embarrassed.

109
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,290
Take it. Grandma made a lot.

110
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,290
We can't finish them all.

111
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,880
Okay.

112
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,960
Eat up, brother.

113
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,330
You'll think of me when you eat it.

114
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,760
Anyway, thank you, Grandma.

115
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,890
You're welcome. It's okay.

116
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,970

Are you here to visit Thames?

138
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,430
Yes, Grandma.

139
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,120
Did you eat anything?

140
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,870

Let's go.

145
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,970
I saw him.

146
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,070
Yes.

147
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,710
What?

148
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,790
Aren't you shocked?

149
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,750
I've overcome it.

150
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,350
Since I found out that his symptoms are the same as yours 18 years ago.

151
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Now that you know it, what will you do after that?

152
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,990
I might need to consult the Master.

153
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,140
Maybe he can help, like what he did to you before.

154
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,720
What about the rumors?

155
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,870
The company said they'd release a statement regarding his situation

156
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,320
and respond to the rumors.

157
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,180
When?

158
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,250
Maybe next week.

159
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,330
But we may need more information from the police.

160
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,950
In that case,

161
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,180
you can deal with the rumors.

162
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,400
As for Thames,

163
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll take care of it.

164
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,620
No.

165
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,530
Why?

166
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,230
I don't want you to take the risk.

167
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,220
Risk?

168
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,990
Yes.

169
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,110
Thames' matter happened to be very complicated.

170
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,830
We don't know what will happen to us.

171
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,940
I don't want you to be in danger.

172
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,160
Complicated?

173
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
How is it complicated?

174
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,350
Haven't you heard the rumor?

175
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,520
Well...

176
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,310
When the rescue team found Thames,

177
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,910
they smelled alcohol.

178
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,990
But there’s no sign of alcohol in his blood after being tested.

179
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,760
The CCTV footage of the party didn’t show him drinking either.

180
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,360
Well...

181
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,310
What you're trying to say is

182
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,310
that someone framed him.

183
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,390
Right.

184
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,710
What about the dashcam and CCTV footage at the scene?

185
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,390
The memory of the dashcam

186
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,640
was stolen.

187
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,560
There were no cameras there either.

188
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,060
Therefore,

189
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,430
we should let the police handle this.

190
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,390
You shouldn't be involved in this.

191
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
But

192
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm the only person who can see him

193
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,530
and talk to him.

194
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,100
Therefore,

195
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,210
I might find out something

196
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,210
that the police don't know.

197
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,160
-Mon, I told you, right? -Trust me, sister.

198
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Trust me.

199
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,420
You won't listen to me no matter what I say, will you?

200
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,490
Don't worry.

201
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,400
I won't let myself be in danger.

202
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,200
What am I going to tell Brother Sing if he asks about this?

203
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,360
You don't have to tell him anything. Just say I was here to find you.

204
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,630
But I didn't see any soul.

205
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,690
You know I'm not good at lying.

206
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,180
No one can hide secrets from him.

207
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,099
Make sure he finds out as late as possible.

208
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,310
Even if he finds out in the end,

209
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,810
he won't be mad at me. You know that.

210
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,640
Trust me.

[Prayers]

212
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,950
Are you going home, kid?

213
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,530
Yes, Grandma.

214
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,880
Let's pray for him.

215
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,110
Normally, ordinary people won't feel pain like this.

216
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,650
But when they fall asleep and don't wake up,

217
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,780
as the elderly said,

218
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,790
the soul can't find its way back to the body.

219
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,660
Let's pray for the Holy Spirit to protect him.

220
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,840
Okay, Grandma.

221
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,410
Master said you'll find out why he gave you the necklace soon.

222
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,210
If that's the case, I want to give him this amulet necklace, Grandma.

223
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,350
Thank you, kid.

224
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm leaving, Grandma.

225
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,710
Take care, kid.

226
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,130
Thank you. Bye.

227
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,840
Let me see you off.

228
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,990
There's no meeting today.

229
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,770
Got it.

230
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,920
There's no deadline this week either.

231
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,500
Okay. I heard it.

232
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,460
Then why are you staring at the calendar?

233
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,130
Looking for a day off?

234
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,130
-A day off? -Yes.

235
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,650
I told you.

236
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,350
Today's wind is especially strong,

237
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,940
as if a rainstorm is coming.

238
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,940
So you're going to rest.

239
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm just checking.

240
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,590
I don't know if I should take leave or not.

241
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,800
Really? Yes.

242
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,190
Then why are you taking leave?

243
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,930
I'm going to visit the Master in Chiang Mai.

244
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,410
Did something happen? That's why you're going to the Master?

245
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,490
Nothing.

246
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,480
It's just a normal visit.

247
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,300
Okay.

248
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,590
Then

249
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,190
can you buy me some Northern chili sauce?

250
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,510
Say it again. Are you paying me to buy some, or should I buy some for you?

251
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,380
I'll pay you for the chili sauce.

252
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,040
But you...

253
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,250
You have to buy me crispy pork.

254
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,330
Hey.

255
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,300
What have I done to meet someone like you?

Nonsense.

How can he see me?

It hurts.

Well...

291
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm already dead.

292
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,360
You're not dead.

293
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,370
It's just that your soul is out of your body.

294
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,760
Huh?

295
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,130
Well, to some, you're dead, but to others, you're not.

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,220
in my opinion,

299
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,070
it is just your soul leaving your body.

When you stop breathing,

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,510
your body stops functioning.

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,210
As for your spirit,

303
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,490
it may leave your body when you're still breathing and your body is still functioning.

304
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,030
That means...

305
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,850
-I still have a chance to resurrect. -Enough.

At first,

I thought I was dead. And I have lost hope.

I don't know. Just...

When you left the hospital,

318

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,700
I was thinking about your face.

Then I was right here.

But I can't go in.

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,800
Oh.

323
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,260
You tried to enter my house.

324

Did you?

325
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,420
Well...

Yes, there are mosquitoes here.

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,070
Look.

No mosquito can bite you.

00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,920
You're lying.

330
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,330
Yes.

Well,

Oh, Grandpa?

It's nothing.

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,770
Grandpa is nice.

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,920
I think

338
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,630
you'd better go back to the hospital.

339
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,370
Because I promised to help you.

340
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,590
I won't break my promise.

341
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,470
I'm not afraid that you'll break your promise.

342
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,840
But do you want me to go back to see myself in that state?

343
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,790
Yes.

344
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,360
Mon, please.

345
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,660
Let me stay here.

346
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,830
Mon, please let me stay here.

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,870
Please.

348
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,440
I'm begging.

349
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,290
I was desperate once.

350
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,270
When I failed to go back to my body after trying so hard.

351
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,360
You have no idea

352
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,260
how happy I am when I know that you can see me.

353
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,610
How about this?

354
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,790
Let me protect your house.

355

looking after it?

357
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,400
Huh?

358
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
An old man?

359
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,170
What?

360
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,430
You immature kid.

361
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,920
Did you just call me an old man?

362
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,110
It hurts, uncle.

363
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,820
Why can't I scream? Would you look at the way you talk?

364
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,220
Are you wearing your grandson's clothes?

365
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,400
That's very rude of you, you monkey.

366
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,670
You're the guardian angel of this house. Why are you so rude?

367
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,140
You must have read too many novels.

368
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,410
And you think that a guardian angel must be old and scary.

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,170
Well,

372
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,430
he said he wouldn't let me in

373
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,260
if you didn't allow it.

374
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,560
I beg you, please let me in.

375
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,160
Damn, Mon!

376
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,340
You can't fall in love with this actor now.

377
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,940
Alright.

378
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,240
I allow it.

379
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,130
That's it.

380
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,190
I'm just a guardian angel.

381
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,950
How can I change human fate?

382
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,030
Boo!

383
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,640
You said you'd go back to the hospital if I let you in.

384
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,770
Yes. But I didn't say when I'd go back.

385
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,760
Liar.

386
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,310
Have you ever been deceived by a ghost, Mon?

387
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,720
Are you going back or not?

388
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,470
Oh, Mon.

389
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,990
Please let me be with you. I beg you.

390
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,470
Please.

391
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,080
Trust me. I'm easy to support.

392
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,670
I'll listen to you.

393
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,510
Please.

394
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,980
Okay. You can stay.

395
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,140
But...

396
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,400
-Sleep on the sofa. -Okay.

397
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,890
Mon!

398
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,950
Mon!

399
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,750
Mon!

400
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,210
Mon!

401
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,590
What's wrong?

402
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,170
Can I come in?

403
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,030
For what?

404
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,310
I'm afraid of ghosts.

405
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
I haven't agreed yet.

406
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,390
Oh, brother.

407
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,130
Your house is really scary.

408
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,460
It's scarier than the hospital.

409
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,920
How did you live here?

410
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,490
I'm used to it.

411
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,620
Do you want to go back to the hospital? You can go back if you want to.

412
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,430
No. I'm not going back.

413
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,240
Brother Mon, please,

414
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,990
can I sleep here?

415
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,790
I'm okay to sleep on the floor if not in bed.

416
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,200
Didn't you say that you're easy to support?

417
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,470
Please, just this once.

418
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,910
I won't ask for anything else.

419
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,230
Thank you.

420
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,250
Can I sleep now?

421
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,700
Yes.

422
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,730
That night,

423
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,760
what happened when you were on your way

424
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,500
to the wrap-up party?

425
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,540
Hmm...

426
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,910
I can't remember anything.

427
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,650
You can't remember anything?

428
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,640
I only remember

429
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,920
that I went to the wrap-up party.

430
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,430
Then

431
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,500
I was suddenly in the hospital.

432
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,500
Another thing I can barely remember is that

433
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,360
I fought with someone, but I can't remember the details.

434
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,230
If that's the case...

435
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,890
Tell me if you remember anything.

436
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,400
Okay.

437
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,790
Okay.

438
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,910
I'll go to sleep now. Good night.

439
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,390
Good night.

440
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,690
Mon! Mon!

441
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,469
What?

442
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:28,909
I'll go with you.

443
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,620
Why are you going? You should stay here.

444
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,750
I can't let anyone see me talking to the air and think that I'm crazy.

445
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,510
I'll be quiet. Please, let me follow you.

446
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,739
Please.

447
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
Let's talk later. I'm busy right now.

448
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,480
If you're bored, go somewhere else.

449
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,630
I tried, but I couldn't.

450
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,130
How did you get here if you couldn't?

451
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,580
Back then?

452
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,400
I just missed you at that time,

453
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,199
then I was here.

454
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,520
But last morning, when you took a shower,

455
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,360
I was thinking...

456
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,120
About what?

457
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,140
I was thinking about my grandma and the hospital.

458
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,880
But I'm still here.

459
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,430
It's late. I'm going to be late. I'll get going.

460
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,990
Talk to the guardian angel if there's anything.

461
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,720
Mon!

462
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,870
Mon, please!

463
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,460
No, I won't allow it.

464
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,510
Mon!

465
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,350
What are you treating me today?

466
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,270
What?

467
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,530
I've been treating you all this time.

468
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,130
What else do you want?

469
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,250
No.

470
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,830
We must celebrate today.

471
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,990
Celebrate for what?

472
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,780
I just talked to Yak.

473
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,580
He said Ton likes your work very much.

474
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,140
Has he confirmed it?

475
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,240
Not necessarily.

476
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,020
Just kidding.

477
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,250
When Yak met Ton,

478
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,110
he said Ton is about to agree.

479
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,190
I wish I could have 100 clients like Ton.

480
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,120
Goodness!

481
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,350
What are you doing?

482
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,530
Why are you acting so violently?

483
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,310
I told you.

484
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,330
It's because you suddenly showed up behind someone else like this.

485
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,690
My heart almost jumped out.

486
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,390
I tried to be gentle.

487
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,020
Because I didn't want to scare you.

488
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,560
Being gentle doesn't help at all.

489
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,280
What do you want?

490
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,820
I just saw you sitting here, bored and lonely.

491
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,310
What's with that?

492
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,590
You're allowed to stay here now.

493
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,470
Why are you here if you don't like it?

494
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,960
Wait.

495
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,790
How did you know I like this place?

496
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,200
If you don't like this place

497
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,690
or don't want to stay here,

498
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,200
why are you transmitted here?

499
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,740
It means

500
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,820
that I was transmitted here

501
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,270
because I want to be here.

502
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,710
Well, not exactly.

503
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,780
Oh, then the result...

504
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,770
How did I get here?

505
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,370
It's none of my business.

506
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,320
But I'll try my best to explain it to you.

507
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,160
The answer is

508
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,050
Karma.

509
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh, Karma.

510
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,800
What does that mean? I don't understand.

511
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,150
Everyone is connected by Karma like a chain.

512
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,790
You and Mon

513
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,720
are connected by Karma.

514
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,820
That's why you're here.

515
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,710
It makes sense to be called fate too.

516
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,550
Is fate that simple?

517
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,030
Yes, it is that simple.

518
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,190
Karma's mission

519
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,030
is just like what happened to you.

520
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,630
What does it have to do with my accident?

521
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,740
You know what happened to you is not an accident, right?

522
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,780
Someone did it on purpose.

523
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,930
It is caused by your Karma

524
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,790
and that person.

525
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,470
It means

526
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,910
that you know who did this to me.

527
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,170
Don't you suspect anyone?

528
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,830
Well, I do.

529
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,150
But I don't know if I get it right or not.

530
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,680
Because I can't remember anything.

531
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,750
No. Actually,

532
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,950
I think it's good that I don't remember.

533
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,490
Otherwise, it will be awful

534
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,040
if I find out that the person who hurt me is someone close to me

535
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,330
——the one that I suspected.

536
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,730
Don't doubt the lost memories.

537
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,550
Take a good look at what's in front of you first.

538
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,240
What do you mean?

539
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,150
That person might not be too far from you.

540
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,950
That's all I can say.

541
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,930
Soon, you will have the answer.

542
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,310
Maybe it's the person you suspected,

543
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,310
or maybe not.

544
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,750
Who is it?

545
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,520
That person is someone you know. That's all I can say.

546
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,910
Soon, you'll have the answer.

547
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe it's the person you suspected, or maybe not.

548
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Thames.

549
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,230
Ton.

550
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,850
Thames.

551
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,090
I like you.

552
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,010
Ton.

553
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,310
Thames.

554
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:03,900
Ton.

555
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,010
Thames.

556
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,080
Thank you for taking me with you.

557
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,590
Okay.

558
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,030
If I don't take you with me, you won't stop complaining.

559
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,140
Why are you acting like you don't want me here?

560
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
Hey, stop it.

561
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,280
I brought you here to fulfill my promise.

562
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,110
Be quiet.

563
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,090
I don't want anyone to think I'm crazy.

564
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,640
Where's your desk?

565
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,440
That one?

566
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,200
Hey, Mon.

567
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,230
Hello.

568
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,560
Hello, Ton.

571
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,410
Do this for Thames and me.

572
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,600
I...

573
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,250
This is not a small matter.

574
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,100
Do you understand how it feels when someone steals something you love?

575
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,890
The ex who abandoned you.

576
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,030
Great.

577
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,380
Damn Ton!
