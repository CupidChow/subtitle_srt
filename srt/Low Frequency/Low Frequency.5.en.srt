00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,650
You’ve told me everything, right?

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,950
Yeah.

7
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,420
What about your relationship with Ai?

8
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,259
Uh.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,060
Well...

10
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,310
I didn't tell you
because I thought it wasn't important.

11
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,470
Do you understand what “everything” means?

12
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,820
Everything means all of it.

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,940
If you don't tell me everything,
how can I help you?

14
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,180
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,630
Brother Mon!

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,790
Brother Mon!

Brother Mon!

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,650
Brother Mon, talk to me.

21
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,890
Brother Mon! Brother Mon!

22
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,390
No, I won’t!

23
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,010
Brother Mon.

24
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,020
Can we please talk?

25
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,079
Brother Mon.

26
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,320
You were mad at me because of Ai last night.

27
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,280
It was because you were jealous, right?

28
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,940
What do you mean?

29
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,450
Do you want to make me angry again?

30
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,720
I won't make you angry again.

31
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,430
Because I won't make you jealous again.

Just...

35
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,420

♫Your voice is like a song echoing in my heart♫

♫My heart melts no matter how many times I see you♫

39

-Brother Mon. -What?

46
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,350
Where are we going?

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,090
Brother Sing's house.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,770
How do we get there?

49
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,800
-Follow me. -What?

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,640
Wait, Brother Mon!

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,020
Wait.

52
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,240
-Hello, Brother Kampan.-Hello, Mr. Mon.

53
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,050
-Are you here to see Mr. Sing? -Yes.

54
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,600
Why didn't you call in advance?

55
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,560
So that I can prepare a room for you.

56
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,070
It's okay, Brother Kampan.

57
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,030
I wanted to give Brother Sing a surprise.

58
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,000
If you’d come a bit later,
Mr. Sing would’ve surprised you instead.

59
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,640
Because he is just about to go out.

60
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,960
That would be great.

61
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,490
Then I can have the whole yard to myself.

62
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,250
Did you come here alone?

63
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Uh, yeah.

64
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,170
That's weird. I thought
I saw someone sitting next to you.

65
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,610
Don’t prank me like that.
I'll get scared too.

66
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,880
Haha. I guess I’m seeing things.

67
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,560
I'll take you to Mr. Sing.

68
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
-Here. -Okay.

69
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,300
Uncle Kampan, who's at the door?

70
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,980
Mon!

71
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,510
Brother Sing.

72
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,220
Why didn't you tell me you would be here?

73
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,560
I wanted to keep it a surprise,

74
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,280
just like how you surprised me
in front of my house.

75
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,880
Uncle Kampan, please ask the maid
to prepare a room for Mon.

76
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,730
Okay.

77
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,130
Have a seat.

78
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,600
Goodness.

79
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,840
How’s it going?
Are you here for the Venerable Grand Father?

80
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,260
Yes.

81
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,200
-It's not about that celebrity, right? -Uh, no.

82
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,400
Of course not.

83
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,409
I'm here because the Venerable Grand Father
wants to see me.

84
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,600
I think it's more about me.

85
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,450
That's good.
Don’t get involved in that kind of thing.

86
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,090
Okay.

87
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,740
You’re not lying, right?

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,010
Why do you think so?

89
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,880
It's because you seem too obedient.

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
Usually, if something like this happens,
you won’t just stand by.

91
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,140
Come on, brother.

92
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm too exhausted from 
meeting the deadlines these days.

93
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,580
I don't have time to worry about others.

94
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I hope it's true. Think of mom
before you do anything.

95
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,770
She’s worried about you.

96
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,940
Okay, brother.

97
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,810
Have you eaten? Are you hungry?

98
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,140
I haven't eaten yet. I'm super hungry.

99
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,730
Okay, I'll ask the maid
to prepare some food.

100
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,520
What do you want to eat?

101
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,970
I want…

102
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,390
Rice vermicelli with northern curry sauce.

103
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
What are you trying to show me, sis?

104
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,550
The police have shown it to me many times.

105
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,370
You saw it too, right?

106
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,220
That night, it wasn’t only Thames who left the party.

107
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,380
Yeah.

108
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,590
Where was Ai?

109
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,530
Ai had just met a major client.

110
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,030
He was exhausted.

111
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,320
So I told him to go home and rest.

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,290
He went back without saying goodbye
to anyone at the party?

113
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,010
Because everyone was drunk at the party.

114
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,430
No one would know even if he said goodbye.

115
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,540
Then what about you? Where did you go?

116
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,840
You didn’t send Ai home.

117
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,810
What's wrong with you?

118
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,930
Are you an undercover police?

119
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,310
I just want to find out what happened.

120
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,090
If you want to know,

121
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,130
ask the police.

122
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
Not me.

123
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,010
If the police could give me an answer,
I wouldn't sit here questioning you.

124
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,460
Answer me.

125
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,220
That day,

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,670
I just had a bad headache.

127
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,370
And I called a taxi for Ai.

128
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,910
That’s all.

129
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,390
Or…

130
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,810
Is there something else you want to know?

131
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,780
I want to know everything.

132
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,950
I suspect that someone framed Thames.

133
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,890
This person could be
the culprit behind Thames’s accident.

134
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,720
Therefore, the most likely suspects

135
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,000
are you and Ai.

136
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,120
I see. You are so worried

137
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
because you lost a top star.

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,150
But it's just a waste of time

139
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,810
if you keep accusing others.

140
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,290
I’m done talking to you.

141
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,180
Wow, these are
all my favourite dishes, Brother Sing.

142
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,760
It’s rare to have you in Chiang Mai.
Of course you have to eat these.

143
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,170
You only eat canned chocolate in Bangkok.

144
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,980
It’s cocoa and hazelnuts.

145
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,990
Brother Mon, I want some too.

146
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,980
I allow it.

147
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,550
Allow what?

148
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,570
Uh.

149
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,990
Your permission!

150
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,580
I’m asking you to allow me to eat first.

151
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,760
Why? That's strange.

152
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,640
You're only asking
after you’ve started eating?

153
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,640
I had just realized it, that's why I asked.

154
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,980
Anyway, is it just the two of us?

155
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,790
Is your girlfriend not coming?

156
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,600
You really hit the spot.

157
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,600
I've been single for a long time.
I haven't found a new girlfriend.

158
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,730
Mom must have been
nagging you nonstop.

159
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,880
She always say
that she wants to have a grandchild.

160
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,230
She did nag a lot. But she stopped
when she found out it led nowhere later.

161
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,080
Be careful. You’ll be the next.

162
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,180
No way.

163
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,440
She knows she won't get one,
no matter how she nags me.

164
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,600
But even so, she wants to see
someone taking care of you.

165
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,120
To see you with
your own family and true love.

166
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,010
Then how’s it going? Any good news for mom?

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,500
I rarely meet people. Of course not.

168
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,290
Well, since you're back, do you want me
to introduce you to a few of my friends?

169
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,030
I have a lot of great friends.

170
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,730
No.

171
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,190
I happen to have someone to talk to.

172
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,130
What? Didn’t you say you rarely meet people?

173
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,320
Can I see a photo?

174
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,650
No.

175
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,040
You're an adult. Don't be shy.

176
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,360
Where is he?

177
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,440
When the time comes,

178
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,760
I’ll bring him to you.

179
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,360
Okay?

180
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,410
Alright.

181
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,930
Let's eat.

182
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,210
Are you good?
You’ve been smiling for an hour.

183
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,320
It's because I'm happy
—someone you talk to.

184
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,280
That's enough.

185
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,920
What’s wrong, brother?

186
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,530
Why are you avoiding me?

187
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,920
How do you know who I was referring to?

188
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,450
So who were you referring to?

189
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,600
You rarely meet people these days.

190
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,500
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You think too much.

191
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,570
Have you got anything

192
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,860
about the suspects? Aside from Ai,

193
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,860
what else could make Mark hate you so much?

194
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
Hm.

195
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,940
It's probably about work.

196
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,140
But I just don't understand
why he'd be so mad at me.

197
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,290
Are you fighting for jobs?

198
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,240
I don't know.

199
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,480
But for me, as long as he tells me the job he wants,

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
I'm ready to give it to him.

201
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,880
Ai, I passed the casting!

202
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,580
-Wow. -I'm happy for you too.

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,410
Look, here’s my name!

204
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,680
What about Mark?

205
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,510
He said he's busy. He'll come later.

206
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,620
Because of him, I am who I am today.

207
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,910
But I heard that Mark’s popularity
has been dropping

208
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,140
while yours never seems to stop rising.

209
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,640
Yeah.

210
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,580
I guess he might feel bad about helping me
into the entertainment industry,

211
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,870
only for me to steal all his jobs.

212
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,619
Do you think Mark is that unreasonable

213
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,310
and cares so much about such things?

214
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,510
I can't think of anyone else.

215
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,790
People are complicated.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,579
Especially when there are dreams
and passion involved, it only gets worse.

217
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,080
Then...

218
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,350
Do you have a dream?

219
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,260
I guess I want to eat all the chocolate in the world.

220
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,590
I’m starting to believe

221
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,320
that you really like chocolate.

222
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,340
What about you?

223
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,290
What do you like to do?

224
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,220
Can being a superstar be called
a dream come true for you?

225
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,330
It used to be in the past.

226
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,040
I built my portfolio,

227
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,460
my fanbase, and my reputation.

228
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,910
But after I became a soul,

229
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,060
it made me realize something.

230
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
Realize what?

231
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,950
I realized that

232
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,720
just being alive and living life

233
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,880
is precious enough.

234
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,080
A soul like this
can't be living life, you know?

235
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,120
When you wake up,

236
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,530
we'll live our lives together.

237
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,260
Whoa.

238
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,450
Are you inviting me to live with you?

239
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,360
Stop teasing me, or I won't talk to you.

240
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,380
Fine.

241
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,360
Brother Mon.

242
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,570
What?

243
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,830
Can I sleep in bed?

244
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,640
It's too cold in Chiang Mai.

245
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,670
It's really cold.

246
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,520
Okay.

247
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,450
-Get up here. -Hehe.

248
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Good night.

249
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,650
Good night.

250
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,940
Can you feel how cold the water is?

251
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,970
I can't feel anything.

252
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,850
That's strange.

253
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,540
But last night, I felt it

254
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,080
when you were peeking at me.

255
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,360
Well, aside from you,

256
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,360
I don't think I can feel anything else.

257
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,090
What a pity. The weather is so nice today.

258
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,140
But I can imagine it.

259
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,540
There should be a breeze.

260
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,830
The water from the waterfall
flows through the body.

261
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,590
And...

262
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,120
I can smell the waterfall too!

263
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,280
You're really a superstar.

264
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,930
Does this waterfall belong to your family?

265
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,310
The waterfall is within the farm,

266
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,070
but it's a little deep inside.

267
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,190
I’m not sure
if we could call ourselves the owners.

268
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,100
But it's so pretty.
It would attract a lot of tourists.

269
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,850
Have you ever wondered
why the locals don’t come here?

270
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,300
Is it because it's too deep?

271
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
It's because they're afraid.

272
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,320
What? Afraid?

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,890
What are they afraid of?

274
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,430
Do you remember my dream?

275
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes, but you didn't tell me in detail.

276
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,370
I was going to wait until you woke up to tell you.

277
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,160
Then I can wait.

278
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,480
Do you want to wait?
I was about to tell you.

279
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,740
Then go on.

280
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,040
But...

281
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,010
-It's scary. -Goodness.

282
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,400
Nothing is scarier
than that uncle next door.

283
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,480
He's a nice man.

284
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,490
The same dream I have every year

285
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,130
is a true event.

286
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,040
It happened when I was ten.

287
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,070
Here. Here. Oh.

288
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,810
Here. Haha. Let's continue.

289
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,750
Bring this here.

290
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,230
You can use mine.

291
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,570
-Hey. -Haha.

292
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,600
After this batch of medicines,
we should be taking a long break.

293
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,720
-You counted everything, right? -Of course.

294
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,290
Don't you trust me?

295
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,080
Guy, wait for me here.

296
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,210
I’ll get help.

297
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,440
-Wait.
-Just for a moment. I'll get someone to help.

298
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,480
-Hey. Who is it?
-What?

299
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,460
-Someone's there! -Go!

300
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,800
He won’t make it.

301
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,460
Guy!

302
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,520
-Guy!
-And you'll be the same.

303
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,090
-Guy! -What do you think?

304
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,920
You won’t be alive either.
Did you see what happened to your friend?

305
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,510
You'll be joining your friend soon.

306
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,240
Guy!

307
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,700
Guy!

308
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,530
Get in there!

309
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,400
Guy and I accidentally made a noise,

310
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
and they caught us.

311
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,010
Guy didn't survive.

312
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,570
I was in a coma for a long time.

313
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,250
And after you woke up,

314
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,600
you started seeing souls.

315
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,350
Yes.

316
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,930
Brother Mon!

317
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,880
Don't talk to anyone, okay?

318
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
-Or else, you can't get back if they invite you to stay.
-Okay.

319
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,260
Didn’t you say the uncle next door was the scariest?

320
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,070
Well, there’s only one of him.

321
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,630
But here...

322
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,570
Alright, don't mind them.

323
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,050
Just follow me.

324
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,950
Remember, your body is a servant of thoughts.

325
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,990
If you don't think it's a big deal,
then it’s not.

326
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,650
Okay.

327
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,250
But if you're scared,

328
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,370
you can hold my hand.

329
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,610
Let's go.

330
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,800
You two came on time.

331
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,390
How are you?

332
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,530
I hang the amulet you’ve given me
on Thames’s bed.

333
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,830
Good. Bear with it.

334
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,000
Once this is over, all the bad luck will pass.

335
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,420
Does that mean I still have a chance
to return to my body?

336
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,130
Your birthday is coming, right?

337
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,530
Yes, in about two weeks.

338
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,880
Then we don't have much time left.

339
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,290
You mean...

340
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,380
The noon on Tinnaphat's birthday

341
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,970
is the final chance his soul could return to his body.

342
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,300
Are you saying that you’ll return my soul
back to my body in two weeks?

343
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,390
I’m not superhuman. I can’t do it.

344
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,180
But you helped me once when I was a child.

345
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,030
Back then, I was just looking
for your consciousness, and I took it back

346
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,630
before it could reach another world.

347
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,140
Then why…

348
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,470
I'm sure Tinnaphat is aware
that his soul can't return to his body.

349
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,250
Then what should I do?

350
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,110
Solve the accident where it happened.

351
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't understand.

352
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,000
This is an inevitable Karma.

353
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,010
Once everything fulfils the condition
to end the cycle of Karma,

354
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,050
-it could be solved.
-What is the cycle of Karma?

355
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,130
What are the conditions?

356
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,620
Can you be more specific?

357
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,300
This is out of my reach.

358
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,140
This is not a monk's duty.

359
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,180
Thank you, the Venerable Grand Father.

360
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,230
Think no matter what you do.

361
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,610
Your wisdom will help
you reach your destination.

362
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,960
Don't worry, you two.
Someone will be helping you.

363
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,340
-Fifteen days.
-Yes, 15 days.

364
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,200
Brother Mon.

365
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,850
What?

366
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Can we make it on time?
And what on earth is the cycle of Karma?

367
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,180
I don't know either.

368
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,410
Brother Mon.

369
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,240
If I can’t return to my body in time,

370
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,060
you should know that I...

371
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
Don't be discouraged.

372
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,150
Will it really work?

373
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,790
We have to make it work.

374
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,190
At least for now, let's not give up.

375
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,950
People are waiting for you, Thames.

376
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,940
And I'm one of them.

377
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,330
What's wrong, Mon?

378
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,090
Since you came back from Chiang Mai, you’ve been miserable.

379
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,720
I was thinking about something.

380
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,660
Huh? What are you thinking about?

381
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,230
Uh.

382
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,570
-Nothing. -What?

383
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,030
You said you were thinking of something.
And now you say you’re not?

384
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,400
Hey, buddy.

385
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,290
You know that you can always talk to me, right?

386
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,730
Well,

387
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,370
if you're afraid of something

388
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,710
but you have to do it

389
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,150
for the sake of helping another person,

390
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,140
will you do it?

391
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,340
It depends on how important that person is to you.

392
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,680
Quite important.

393
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,080
What will happen if you don't help?

394
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,290
He might die.

395
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,920
Are you afraid that they’ll die?

396
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,880
I am.

397
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,890
Then you should ask yourself. What are you more afraid of?

398
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,640
I have the answer now.

399
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,580
Thank you so much.

400
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,860
Yeah, no problem.

401
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,730
Thames.

402
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,840
Yes?

403
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,200
I’ve got the answer.

404
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,900
What answer?

405
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,080
The hint that
the Venerable Grand Father gave us.

406
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,180
Solve the accident
where it happened by yourself.

407
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,640
It refers to the location of your accident.

408
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,080
I can guess that too.

409
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,450
But I don't know how it is relevant.

410
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,740
The police have also kept the evidence.

411
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,290
There's nothing left.

412
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,280
But the souls nearby are still there.

413
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,350
What souls?

414
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,360
Do you know that you're not the first person
to have had an accident there?

415
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,270
Actually,

416
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,750
the curve is also known as

417
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,760
the "100-Death Curve".

418
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,610
Mon!

419
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,820
Are you really going to open your third eye there?

420
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,630
Yes, Mr. House Spirit.

421
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,670
Are you aware

422
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,620
that the curve is full of wandering souls?

423
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,550
I am.

424
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,390
Forget it.

425
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,970
Those ghosts are hungry and mindless.

426
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,080
We never know what will happen to you
if they know you can see them.

427
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,320
Brother Mon.

428
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,090
That's not what we were talking about.

429
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,390
But there's no other way.

430
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,400
Despite my fear,

431
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,550
I have to do it.

432
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,790
Hey.

433
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,990
This place is awesome.

434
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,370
I'm not used to you asking me out like this.

435
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,010
Don't you want me to ask you out?

436
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,020
No.

437
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,980
It just feels unusual.

438
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,890
Actually,

439
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,240
I feel the same too.

440
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,850
How?

441
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,590
Well,

442
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,980
the two of us are so happy

443
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,950
while Thames is lying in pain.

444
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,910
He's not in pain at all.

445
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,730
He is in such a coma
that he probably feels like he's asleep.

446
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,160
That's the same thing.

447
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,970
Ai,

448
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,090
let me ask you something.

449
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,370
Would you still ask me out like this

450
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,030
if Thames weren’t in a coma?

451
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,660
That’s a funny question.

452
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,570
Why not?

453
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,550
We are friends.

454
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,860
Right. I guess so.

455
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,420
Do you have anything else

456
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,210
for asking me out today?

457
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,070
I want to say thank you.

458
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,870
For what?

459
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,750
You didn’t tell anyone
about that thing you knew.

460
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,480
Is it necessary, Ai?

461
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,640
Yes, it is.

462
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,140
Thank you for keeping it a secret.

463
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
Brother Mon.

464
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,880
Are you sure about this?

465
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,490
I've made up my mind.

466
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,170
But we still have other ways.

467
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,200
Listen to me.

468
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,960
We only have two weeks left.

469
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,190
I know.

470
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,460
So,

471
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,670
I have to do this.

472
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,590
But I can't take it
if something bad happens to you.

473
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,830
But if I keep you in trouble
because of my fear,

474
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,010
I can't take it either.

475
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,350
Brother Mon.

476
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,930
Trust me.

477
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,290
If you let me choose between

478
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,080
being afraid of ghosts and letting you die,

479
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,840
I'd rather be afraid of ghosts.

480
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,090
[Thames Thinnaphat Thanathikan sent a video]

481
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,140
You scared me.

482
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,810
I'm sorry.

483
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,210
I forgot to ask you.

484
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,980
I can see souls too.
Don't you want me to talk to them?

485
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,210
No.

486
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,100
The souls here are people
who died on the curve.

487
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,340
They don't like communicating with others,

488
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,940
-unless... -Unless what?

489
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,420
Unless it's a living person
that can offer them merits.

490
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,750
And that's you, right?

491
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,420
Can I continue reciting now?

492
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,680
Okay.

493
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,840
Brother Mon!

494
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,660
Stay strong. Take a deep breath.

495
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,340
Your body is a servant of your mind.

496
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,810
If you're afraid,

497
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,690
hold my hand.

498
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,380
Can we talk first?

499
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,980
What do you offer?

500
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,910
I'll make merits for you.

501
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,610
I will do good deeds for all of you.

502
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,770
Why should we believe you?

503
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,860
I won't put myself at risk.

504
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,610
Just now,

505
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,080
if you hadn't stopped,

506
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,390
I'm afraid I wouldn't be here.

507
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,540
I know that you all

508
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,490
want to leave here according to the time.

509
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,390
What do you want to know?

510
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,000
Last month,

511
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,900
an accident happened here.

512
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,700
There are often accidents here.

513
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,280
Who would remember?

514
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,580
A white car with the number plate “3KY4544”.

515
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,210
Is it his?

516
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,320
I remember that.

517
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:12,100
He’s so handsome. I remember it very well.

518
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,930
So you're still alive?

519
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,810
It's a pity that you can't be with us.

520
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,550
He's a celebrity.

521
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,650
Haven't you watched his drama?

522
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,060
That’s even more of a pity.

523
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,440
Does anyone remember
what happened during the accident?

524
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,100
I think there was another car
tailing him, right?

525
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,460
I think so.

526
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,700
There was a black car behind his car.

527
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,300
It seemed like they were chasing each other.

528
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,140
But the black car stopped

529
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,060
when the white car lost balance.

530
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,650
Someone got off.

531
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,410
Oh, I remember.

532
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,310
Someone got out of the car,
and hit the white car’s driver with a rock.

533
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,440
He even poured the alcohol on him.

534
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,840
How cruel.

535
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,040
Does anyone remember the face of the perpetrator?

536
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,800
No.

537
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,620
I only remember that the black car’s owner
tried to do something after that,

538
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,700
but someone drove over,

539
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,440
so he got in the car and ran away.

00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,820
ask Ai out?

549
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,120
I've had enough. I quit.

550
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,020
If you quit, I'll expose you!

551
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,490
If you do, this won’t end well!

552
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,140
If I could raise you to where you are today,

553
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,970
I could bury you under the ground as well.
You ungrateful brat.

554
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,980
Are you sure you were grooming me
but not sexually assaulting me?
