[Previously]

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,400
-Brother Mon! Brother Mon!
-What?

5
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,460
-I'll go with you.
-Why? Just stay here.

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,640
Do you want people to see me talking to the air and think that I'm crazy?

7
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,479
I'll be quiet. Please, let me follow you.

8
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,630
Please.

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,190
Let's talk next time. I'm busy today.

10
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,370
If you're bored, go somewhere else.

11
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,470
I tried, but I couldn't.

12
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,000
How did you get here if you couldn't?

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Back then?

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,330
I was just thinking.

15
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,169
Then suddenly I was here.

16
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,610
But this morning, when you took a shower,

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,210
-I was thinking...
-About what?

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,200
I was thinking about my grandma and the hospital.

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,990
But I couldn't go anywhere. I’m still here.

20
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,340
It's late. I'm going to be late. I'll get going.

21
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,750
-Talk to Mr. House Spirit if there’s anything.
-Brother Mon!

22
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,040
Please, Brother Mon!

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,600
No, I won't allow it.

24
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,990
You know what happened to you wasn’t an accident.

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,680
Someone did it on purpose.

26
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,820
It was caused by your ill-fated relationship

27
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,520
with that person.

28
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,360
It means

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,810
that you know who did this to me.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,150
Can you swear that you have never suspected anyone?

31
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,690
I did.

32
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,100
But I don't know if I get it right or not.

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,550
Because I can't remember anything.

34
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,670
No, actually...

35
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,570
I may not remember anything because there was too much going on.

36
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,370
It must be awful

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,910
if I find out that the person who hurt me is someone close to me

38
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,260
——the one that I suspected.

39
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't doubt your lost memories.

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,510
Take a good look at what's in front of you first.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,280
What do you mean?

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,210
That person might not be too far from you.

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,940
That's all I can say.

44
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,030
Soon, you will have the answer.

45
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,220
Maybe it's the person you're suspecting,

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,740
or maybe not.

47
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,890
Mon.

48
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,350
What's wrong?

49
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,060
Did you allow that kid to watch TV?

50
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,950
Yes, I did.

51
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,680
He's been watching the TV all day.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,100
And it is super loud.

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,390
The neighbours are complaining.

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Go talk to him.

55
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,110
I'm going to take a nap.

56
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,270
Okay.

57
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,810
Why are you back so early today?

58
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,470
The meeting ended early today.

59
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,750
What about you?

60
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,110
Are you deaf?

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Why did you turn up the TV so loud?

62
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm watching an action movie, so it needs to be loud.

63
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
I've been bored as a soul for days

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,310
before I realized I could watch TV.

65
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,390
I just found out, too.

66
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,520
Can you turn down the volume next time?

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Or else, the neighbors will complain.

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,370
What neighbor?

69
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,170
Do you want to get strangled by the old man?

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,870
Bother Mon, I've been wondering.

71
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,880
About what?

72
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,470
Since you’ve allowed me to watch TV,

73
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,680
I have been able to watch TV.

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,870
If you allow me to drive,

75
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,720
I should be able to drive too, right?

76
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,740
I'm not sure.

77
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,270
But...

78
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,610
Dream on.

79
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,520
I don't want a self-driving car yet.

80
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,690
Oh, what are you worried about?

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,470
I'm better at driving than AI and electric cars. Trust me.

82
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,050
I don't believe it.

83
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,560
-Trust me.
-Nope.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Just give it a try.

85
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,130
I told you. I'm not sure if it's going to work or not.

86
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,790
Brother Mon!

87
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,760
Yes?

88
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,770
Brother Mon!

89
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,600
What?

90
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,510
Do you have other clothes for me?

91
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,390
It's uncomfortable to sleep in this.

92
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,310
Just sleep.

93
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,950
I can't sleep.

94
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,240
Do you want to wear the hospital gown again?

95
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,040
Do you really don't have any other clothes?

96
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,570
I see you have tons of clothes.

97
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,710
I don't want to wear the hospital gown.

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,850
So let me wear your clothes.

99
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,230
What?

100
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,090
Are you serious?

101
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,710
That's all I have.

102
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,350
Put on your own clothes if you don't want it.

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Alright.

104
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Are you happy now?

105
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,450
Yes.

106
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,460
Brother Mon.

107
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,450
What's wrong?

108
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,460
Did some strange people approach you recently?

109
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,000
Strange?

110
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,659
What do you mean by strange?

111
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,570
Just...

112
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,530
Is anyone pursuing you or approaching you on purpose?

113
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,039
Hmm...

114
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,310
I haven't met someone like that in years.

115
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,000
I only talk to clients.

116
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,370
Why did you ask?

117
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,780
There's a jerk who loves to steal my lover.

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,220
I thought he might come after you.

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,080
Someone who loves to steal your lover?

120
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,510
Yes. Forget about it.

121
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,850
-So there's none, right?
-No.

122
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,220
But you're saying that he's been stealing your lover.

123
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,940
So you're afraid that he'll pursue me?

124
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,710
Yes, something like that.

125
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,020
Then you can rest assured.

126
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,810
Because there's nothing between us.

127
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,040
Well, you're right.

128
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,240
What are you wearing?

129
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,840
My stomach hurts!

130
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm dying.

131
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
My stomach hurts, Brother Mon!

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Look at his outfit.

133
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,070
He’s got tears in his eyes.

134
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,990
Mr. House Spirit!

135
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,110
I'm sorry. Please let me in.

136
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,520
Please let me in. I'm sorry.

137
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,190
I told you, didn't I?

138
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,960
I can't help it.

139
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm really sorry.

140
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,610
Please.

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
You’re on your own.

142
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,230
Please,

143
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,640
Mr. House Spirit.

144
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,150
Brother Mon!

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,150
Well,

146
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,440
didn't you say you wouldn't do anything about his outfits?

147
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,760
Actually, I agree with you.

148
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,490
But I didn't have a chance before.

149
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,910
Now, I have the chance

150
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,640
to buy him some clothes.

151
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,150
Even if he doesn't look better,

152
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,910
at least he will have more clothes to mix and match.

153
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,570
Right.

154
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,690
You're so kind.

155
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,950
I really like you.

156
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,950
Oh, I mean,

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,800
I like your kindness.

158
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,110
Fine.

159
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,720
If I'm not kind,

160
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,530
I wouldn't have taken you in.

161
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
What if you didn't?

162
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,110
Okay, you can continue.

163
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,600
Wow.

164
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,110
It looks delicious.

165
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,080
If you allow me to eat ice cream, can I eat it?

166
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,030
Okay.

167
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,730
Try it. I allow it.

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,760
Hey.

169
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,270
Awesome.

170
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,120
Eat up. Eat up.

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,690
It's tasteless.

172
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,150
That means you're still alive.

173
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,190
Normally,

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,030
when people send food to the dead,

175
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,110
the dead can taste it.

176
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
How did you know?

177
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,560
I asked about it.

178
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,110
-Have you died before?
-I asked the dead.

179
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,610
Oh.

180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,400
You scared me.

181
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,410
Pay attention. Listen carefully.

182
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm not eating it.

183
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Don't waste food. Just eat it.

184
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,910
I'll watch you eat instead.

185
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,990
Eat up.

186
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,370
It feels weird to have someone watching you while eating.

187
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,450
Just eat it.

188
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,150
Your ice cream is melting.

189
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,990
-I'll watch you eat.
-Goodness.

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,870
It's all over your mouth. You eat like a child.

191
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,870
You can come in now.

192
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,150
Right.

193
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,110
Thames.

194
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,070
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,810
It's okay.

196
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,640
I know I'm not much of a dresser.

197
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,800
Don't say that, Mr. House Spirit.

198
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,040
Everyone goes through a phase where they're not good at dressing up.

199
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,730
Look.

200
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,910
We bought these for you.

201
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,910
I just learned that you can do this to a house spirit.

202
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,560
I just learned that too.

203
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,200
Thank you to both of you.

204
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,910
I'll dress you up when I'm free.

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,950
But aren't you always free?

206
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,530
Right.

207
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
So handsome.

208
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,810
Oppa, I love you.

209
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,270
Oppa House Spirit!

210
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,400
Wow, it looks delicious.

211
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,200
What a pity. I made it for you.

212
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,690
But you can't taste it.

213
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,370
That's right.

214
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,560
But since you're so good at cooking,

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,270
you should cook more often.

216
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,880
You shouldn't eat only chocolate.

217
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,870
It's not chocolate.

218
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,950
It's a mixture of hazelnut and cocoa.

219
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,950
Just kidding.

220
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,870
I would like to cook too, If I have time.

221
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,230
But I'm lazy to wash the dishes after cooking.

222
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,320
And eventually, I don't cook that much.

223
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,190
Do you want to try it?

224
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,840
You know that I can't taste it.

225
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,870
Just try it.

226
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,840
Just pretend that you're enjoying it. I made it for you.

227
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,310
Sure.

228
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,570
-Brother Mon, I can taste it!
-What?

229
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,190
You're good at acting, you really fit your job.

230
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,870
-As expected from a celebrity.
-No, it's true!

231
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,870
I can really taste it.

232
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,030
Okay, you can have it.

233
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,570
It's so good.

234
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,600
You're overacting, I can't tell if you're serious or not.

235
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,110
It's true!

236
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Wait.

237
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Why couldn't I taste the ice cream at the mall?

238
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,600
Hmm.

239
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,680
I don't know either.

240
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,480
I'll ask the Master when I visit him.

241
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,280
It's so delicious.

242
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,770
Eat up. Eat up.

243
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,800
-Can I trust you or not?
-It's so delicious.

244
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,520
I can really taste it.

245
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,880
-What do you think?
-Very cool.

246
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,200
My nephew bought it for me.

247
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,069
Uncle.

248
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,599
Brother Mon asked me to bring you some cabbage porridge.

249
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,440
Ooh, thank you.

250
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,190
-I'll get going, then.
-Wait.

251
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,640
How’s your accident investigation?

252
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,560
It's going nowhere.

253
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,230
What about the person you suspect?

254
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,600
It's still the same.

255
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,990
I still can't remember anything.

256
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,230
When a soul can't recall the past,

257
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,600
it's partly because the soul refuses to recall it.

258
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,530
It refuses to accept the fact that something has happened.

259
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Then what should I do?

260
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
Try to lie down and focus.

261
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
Think of the event on that night.

262
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,310
It might not help much,

263
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,190
but it should help you remember something.

264
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,150
Okay, uncle. I'll try.

265
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,400
Bon appetit.

266
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,600
Thank you.

267
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,450
Wow. Is it that good?

268
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,680
Ah!

269
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,520
It's the best food I've ever had in my life.

270
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,120
Is it really that delicious or is it because you haven't eaten for days?

271
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,360
If you want to find out, then...

272
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
Then you should cook more for me.

273
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,450
I guess I can’t ask you to do the dishes.

274
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,570
I'll do it when I recovered.

275
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay.

276
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,040
-Brother Mon.
-What?

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,870
I had so much fun today.

278
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,120
Because you could go out and have fun?

279
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,160
Yes, but...

280
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,770
Normally, I don't have many friends.

281
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,490
And I'm a celebrity.

282
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,270
No matter where I go and what I do,

283
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,400
I have to rush and be careful.

284
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,200
If I do what I did today,

285
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,400
there would've been rumors spreading tomorrow.

286
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,720
I guess so.

287
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,200
If my elder brother is with me, I'm sure he'll do the same.

288
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,080
Do you have a brother?

289
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840
Used to.

290
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
A half-brother.

291
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,640
Used to? Where is he now?

292
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,680
He passed away a long time ago.

293
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,190
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

294
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,480
It's been a long time.

295
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,650
I can't even remember his face.

296
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,150
But now I have you.

297
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,810
But I don't want a younger brother like you at all.

298
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,480
That hurts.

299
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,680
If you don't want me to be your brother,

300
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,960
what do you want me to be?

301
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,310
Well,

302
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,990
I want you to be strong.

303
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,760
So that you could wake up, and don't have to face the rumors.

304
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,070
And no one will do anything bad to you.

305
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,720
Also,

306
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,950
you can live the life you want.

307
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,850
That's all, I guess.

308
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,560
Thank you.

309
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,150
[No one can compare to Thames.]

310
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,080
[International Superstar]

311
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,840
-[Then how about you?]
-[Help!]

312
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,400
[I just pity you.]

313
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,990
-[Help!]
-[Take care of yourself.]

314
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,440
-[I like you, senior.]
-[Mark, what you’re doing]

315
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,110
-[is the reason why you’ll never be like Thames.]
-[You really don't know anything.]

316
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,850
Thank you for bringing me here.

317
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,910
If I don't bring you here, you'll keep bothering me.

318
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,680
Why do you act like you don't want me here?

319
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,080
Well, since I brought you here, you must keep your promise.

320
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,680
Stay quiet.

321
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,520
I don't want people to think I'm crazy.

322
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,160
Okay.

323
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,600
Where's your desk?

324
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,240
Over there.

325
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,440
-Hello, Mr. Mon.
-Hello, Mr. Ton.

326
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,360
You're early.

327
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Do you understand how it feels when someone steals something you love?

328
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,640
Your ex-girlfriend, who just dumped you,

329
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,870
-is awesome.
-Ton, you jerk!

330
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,840
But no matter what,

331
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,030
I was just playing around.

332
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,720
Thames.

333
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,950
I like you, senior.

334
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,520
Brother Ton. Brother Ton.

335
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,200
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr Ton.

336
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,190
-You're early today.
-There wasn't much traffic today.

337
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,150
I was in a hurry too.

338
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,110
I want to hear the summary ASAP.

339
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,990
I'll get ready, then.

340
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,960
I'll see you in the meeting room.

341
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,760
Don't worry, Mr. Mon. I can wait.

342
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,870
Please come this way.

343
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,370
Go get ready.

344
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,950
What's wrong? Tell me.

345
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,490
How do you know Ton?

346
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,440
He's my client.

347
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,490
How long has he been your client?

348
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,950
It's been a while.

349
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,200
-How long has he been pursuing you?
-Pursue?

350
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
Mr Ton? Pursue me?

351
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,030
Didn't I tell you? He's my client.

352
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,480
But you can choose not to work for him.

353
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,960
Thames, you're being unreasonable.

354
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,110
I'm serious.

355
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,000
You can work with him,

356
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,190
but you have to keep your distance from him.

357
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,440
He's dangerous.

358
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,800
Do you understand?

359
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,320
What?

360
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,950
I can actually touch you.

361
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
And I can hold your hand too.

362
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,720
I can really touch you.

363
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,960
Why are you touching yourself?

364
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,610
How is that possible?

365
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,950
That's cool!

366
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,290
How do you feel?

367
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,960
We’re touching each other's hands for real.

368
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,070
I feel the same.

369
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,610
Did you know you could touch a soul before?

370
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,650
I tried it when I was young.

371
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
But it was like touching the air.

372
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,870
It didn't feel as real as this.

373
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,360
How is that possible?

374
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,880
I don't know either.

375
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,520
That's great.

376
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,720
Only you and I can do it.

377
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,270
What are you trying to do?

378
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm helping you to get rid of the flies.

379
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,920
Try harder next time.

380
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,310
Do you know that this is my grandma's favorite?

381
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,360
It seems that your whole family likes it.

382
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,680
Why don't you cook it for my grandma too?

383
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,080
She's going to love you for it.

384
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,720
-You've gone too far.
-It's true.

385
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,650
Then can you tell me

386
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,310
what happened when we were at the office?

387
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,990
Oh.

388
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,770
Do you remember that guy who steals my lovers as a hobby?

389
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,560
Yes.

390
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,730
It's Ton.

391
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,070
The relative that you both don't like each other?

392
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,110
No.

393
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,650
To be precise, we loathe each other.

394
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,270
If there's someone in this world who wants to hurt me,

395
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,530
it's probably him.

396
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,190
So my accident

397
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,800
might be caused by him.

398
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,910
Let's eat.

399
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,520
Thank you. How did you know I like Kaeng Hang Le?

400
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,810
Thames told me before

401
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,120
that his family likes it.

402
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,880
So I made this dish for you, Grandma.

403
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,150
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

404
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,610
How is Thames now?

405
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,230
It's still the same.

406
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,310
Nothing was found in the test.

407
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,270
But he's still unconscious. It's like he's asleep.

408
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,870
Have a bite, Grandma.

409
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,990
-A big one for you.
-Wow.

410
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,840
-It looks appetizing.
-Thank you.

411
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,560
It looks delicious.

412
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,310
Your cooking is really good.

413
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,190
Thank you, Grandma.

414
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,680
But Sister Bua told me that you don't eat much lately.

415
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,990
I have no appetite.

416
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,640
But forget it. Don't talk about that.

417
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,120
If Thames hears this, he's going to overthink.

418
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,480
If you like it,

419
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,040
I'll cook it for you often.

420
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,150
But...

421
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,480
But you have to promise me that you’ll eat your meals regularly.

422
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
Deal?

423
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,110
You shouldn't force the elderly like this, kid.

424
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,610
Let's say I'm doing this for Thames.

425
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,870
So when he wakes up, he'll get to see you healthy.

426
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,120
Promise?

427
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,120
Okay.

428
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,540
Let's eat.

429
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,500
It's really good.

430
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,310
I can eat it at every meal.

431
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,860
Mon.

432
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,270
-Yes?
-I want to wake up.

433
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,030
Can we go find the Master now?

434
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,960
Calm down.

435
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,310
I just called him.

436
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,960
Master will be back in two weeks.

437
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,560
Did you book the tickets?

438
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,840
Yes, but only one ticket.

439
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,230
What about me?

440
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,410
You don't need a ticket.

441
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,640
Oh, right.

442
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,760
-Right?
-This is nice.

443
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,440
It's a free flight.

444
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,950
It saves a lot.

445
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,280
Not bad.

446
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,280
According to my investigation,

447
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,360
I think Ton is innocent.

448
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,370
Who would leave the evidence online?

449
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,840
Who knows?

450
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,650
But we can't eliminate him yet.

451
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,110
Then

452
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,650
besides Mr. Ton, who else is a suspect?

453
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,230
Oh.

454
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,760
I've been focused on recalling the memories as Mr. House Spirit told me to.

455
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,870
-And then?
-I remembered something else.

456
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,489
What is it?

457
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,520
I got into a fight with an actor friend that day.

458
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,840
-Let's have a toast!
-Cheers!

459
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,520
Cheers!

460
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,600
That was strong.

461
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,870
Thank you for coming today.

462
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,949
Especially you.

463
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,230
My name is Thames, brother.

464
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,520
Thames.

465
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,770
Sorry, I'm drunk.

466
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,489
I'm sorry. Make yourselves at home, guys.

467
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,760
-You guys talk. I'm going to flirt with the girls.
-I knew it.

468
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,400
Move, I want to sit here too.

469
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,040
Are you good?

470
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,480
-Cheers.
-Okay, let's do that.

471
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,690
Aren't you drinking, Thames?

472
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,030
No, I'm trying to control my weight.

473
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,240
Why are you so serious? It's just a sip.

474
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,650
You won't gain weight.

475
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
You should drink less.

476
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,910
Don't you have a show tomorrow morning?

477
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,560
You're right.

478
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,440
But I've tried my best.

479
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,880
Because I won't be as good as you.

480
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,200
Why should I be worried?

481
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,520
Hey.

482
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,070
Why did you say that?

483
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,160
Mark, what you're doing now is the reason why you'll never be like Thames.

484
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,120
Ai, what did you say?

485
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,680
It's because you are such a person,

486
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,560
that's why you're no match for Thames.

487
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,400
Who could be on Thames's level?

488
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,490
He's an international superstar.

489
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,840
Calm down.

490
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,910
I'm calm.

491
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,000
But I just pity you.

492
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,530
You don't know anything.

493
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,640
What do I not know?

494
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,280
What is it?

495
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,440
You're not who you are now only because of your ability,

496
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,200
but because you have more people who like you than I do.

497
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,600
So...

498
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,150
Except for Ton, Mark is also a suspect, right?

499
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,560
Mark and Ai are the same.

500
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,680
Wait, what does it have to do with Ai?

501
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,320
It's normal for people in the entertainment industry to be jealous of each other.

502
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,490
Yes.

503
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,680
That's how it works. I see.

504
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,230
Then,

505
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,080
what are you going to do next?

506
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,030
Nothing.

507
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,230
I'll keep investigating

508
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,230
to find the person who did the bad thing to you.

509
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,190
Cool.

510
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,910
I'm not used to this.

511
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,650
You'll get used to it soon. What are you looking at?

512
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,110
According to the information I found,

513
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,870
there are only receipts. Nothing special.

514
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,830
But I found this video.

515
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,910
Ai, can I ask you something?

516
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,270
What?

517
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,430
The night I quarrelled with Thames,

518
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,730
you didn't rush back just because you were tired, right?

519
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,720
Mark, what are you trying to find out?

520
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,490
Ai, what are you doing here?

521
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,860
Mark.

522
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,670
I should be the one asking, what are you doing here?

523
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,510
Why are you following me?

524
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,850
Are you a stalker?

525
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,050
Ai.

526
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,720
Didn't you promise that you won't do it again?

527
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,770
Can you stay out of this?

528
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,520
Who are you talking to? Why are you smiling so happily?

529
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,710
Nothing.

530
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,030
Brother Mon.

531
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,430
Do you think I'm able to use my phone?

532
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,830
Stop.

533
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,350
What do you want to do? Are you going to post "Hello from a Soul"?

534
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,240
No.

535
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,580
Where is my phone?

536
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,040
Sister Bua said that it is with the police.

537
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,470
I'm going to bed.

538
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,390
[In the next episode]

539
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,230
Mr. Mon, can you come with me to this room?

540
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,170
Okay.

541
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,610
I'm sorry.

542
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,910
Can we talk?

543
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Brother Mon!
