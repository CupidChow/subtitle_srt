[Previously]

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,710
Well,

5
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,690
if you're scared of something,

6
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,890
but you have to do it

7
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,259
for the sake of helping another person,

8
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,590
will you do it?

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,520
What will happen if you don't help him?

10
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,580
He might die.

11
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,590
Then you should ask yourself which one you're more afraid of.

12
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,930
Ai, I passed the casting!

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
-Wow. -I'm happy for you too.

14
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,450
Look, here’s my name!

15
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,160
Ai.

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,290
Let me ask you something.

17
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Would you still ask me out like this

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,510
if Thames weren’t in a coma?

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,900
That’s a funny question.

20
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,780
Why wouldn’t I?

21
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,790
We are friends.

22
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,710
Hmm, right.

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,710
You saw it too, right?

24
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,720
Thames wasn’t the only one 
who left the party that night.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,160
Where is Ai?

26
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,390
Ai just went to meet a major client.

27
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,990
He’s tired.

28
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,240
So I asked him to go back and rest.

29
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,670
What about you? Where did you go?

30
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,900
You didn’t send Ai home.

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,290
That day,

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,360
I just had a bad headache.

33
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,510
So I called a taxi for Ai.

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,670
I suspect that someone framed Thames.

35
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,430
This person could be the one
behind Thames’s accident.

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,010
Therefore, the most likely suspects

37
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,550
are you and Ai.

38
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,150
Brother, stay strong. Take a deep breath.

39
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,610
Your body is a servant of your mind.

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,170
If you're scared,

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,970
hold my hand.

42
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,750
Can we talk first?

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,340
What do you offer?

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,190
I'll make merits for you.

45
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
I will do good deeds for all of you.

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,060
Why should we believe you?

47
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,170
I won't put myself at risk.

48
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,800
If…

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,430
You didn't stop just now,

50
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,750
I'm afraid I wouldn't be standing here.

51
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,860
I know

52
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,690
that you want to leave here
according to your time.

53
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,620
What do you want to know?

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,290
Last month,

55
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,130
an accident happened here.

56
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,830
There are often accidents here.

57
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,320
Who would remember?

58
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,180
It was a white car
with the plate number 3KY4544.

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,650
Is it his?

60
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,560
I remember.

61
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,630
He’s so handsome. I remember it very well.

62
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,160
So you're still alive?

63
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,170
It's a pity that you can't be with us.

64
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,830
He's a celebrity.

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,890
Haven't you watched his drama?

66
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,230
That’s even more of a pity.

67
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,760
Does anyone remember
the day of the accident?

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,380
I think there was a car tailing him, right?

69
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,610
I think so.

70
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,000
There was a black car behind him.

71
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,420
It seemed like they were chasing each other.

72
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,450
When the white car lost balance,

73
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,340
the black car stopped.

74
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,840
And someone got off.

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,640
Oh, I remember.

76
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,510
Someone got out of the car,
hit the white car’s driver with a rock

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,270
and poured the alcohol on him.

78
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,110
How cruel.

79
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,260
Does anyone remember his face?

80
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,930
No.

81
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,790
I only remember that the black car’s driver
tried to do something after that.

82
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,960
But someone drove over,

83
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,730
so he got in the car and ran away.

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
Are you okay?

85
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,470
Brother Mon.

86
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,110
I remember it now.

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,100
Do you?

88
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,090
Do you remember who the perpetrator is?

89
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,290
I didn't see his face.

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,530
But I remember it was a man.

91
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,330
Was it a man?

92
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,220
There's Mr Tek's warehouse over there.

93
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,210
I’m not sure if there’s a CCTV.

94
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,500
If there is one,
it must have captured something.

95
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,080
Let's try and ask.

96
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Thank you, everyone.

97
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,560
Thank you.

98
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,440
Thank you very much.

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
We’ll get going.

100
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,210
-Mon. -Hello.

101
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,950
Hello.

102
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,100
Your order hasn't arrived yet.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,040
Uh, I’m not here for that.

104
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,170
I just remembered that your shop
is across the "100-Death Curve”.

105
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,810
My shop is across the "100-Death Curve",
and what’s about it?

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
Well,

107
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
I...

108
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,860
I'd like to check the CCTV footage
in your store.

109
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,200
-You want to check the CCTV footage?
-Yes.

110
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, no problem. Follow me.

111
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,730
That's all we have, Mon.

112
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,620
There’s no footage
for the other side of the road?

113
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,640
Of course not.

114
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,630
It's illegal to have
the camera pointing at that side.

115
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,360
Actually, I used to
put a camera there before.

116
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,550
But my worker said they often saw
a women in white standing across the road.

117
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,350
So I removed the camera.

118
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,240
Then...

119
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,610
That's all we have, I guess.
Thank you very much.

120
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,980
Hey, wait.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,070
Aren't you going to tell me what happened?

122
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,580
Was it the accident of that famous celebrity?

123
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,220
Yes, it’s about that case.

124
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,360
-Do you know him? -Well...

125
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,850
We chatted before.

126
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,770
It is a strange case.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,630
The police said it was an accident,

128
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,940
but people keep asking me
to check the CCTV footage.

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
Did anyone ask you
for the CCTV footage before me?

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,730
Yes.

131
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,080
If that's the case,

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
can I see the CCTV footage
of the day they came?

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,090
Sure. Here.

134
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,650
This one.

135
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,030
I can't see his face.

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,510
But I remember it was a man.

137
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,300
Brother Mon.

138
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,460
I want to see the CCTV footage from the parking lot.

139
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,260
-Brother Tek. -Yes?

140
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,410
Can I look at the CCTV footage
of the parking lot?

141
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,910
Sure.

142
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,470
Here it is.

143
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,490
-Hello? -Mark.

144
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,740
What's wrong, Ai?

145
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,850
I forgot to thank you
when I was at the shop.

146
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,430
Thank you?

147
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,490
For keeping that a secret.

148
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,180
But you already thanked me once.

149
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,680
Really?

150
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,270
Maybe I’m confused.

151
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,210
But I really want to thank you.

152
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,710
It’s nothing, Ai.

153
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,640
I will keep it a secret.

154
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,600
Except when you're drunk, right?

155
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,530
Drunk? You're the one who's getting drunk.

156
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,450
After I got drunk
and caused a scene that day,

157
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,300
I decided not to get drunk again.

158
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,140
But I want to apologize to you.

159
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,070
The night I was drunk,

160
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,320
-I'm sorry.
-Isn't it too late to apologize now?

161
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,280
That's because I’ve only got the courage
to tell you now.

162
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,930
Actually, I want to apologize to you too.

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,540
I used to be rude to you.

164
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,400
Shall we start over?

165
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,650
Let's meet more often.

166
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,970
Just like when we were young.

167
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,460
Sure.

168
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,090
Brother Mon!

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,410
I remember what happened that night.

170
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
That night?

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,250
But I only remember
what happened at the party.

172
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,090
And I'm not sure if I remember everything.

173
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,100
Come on, try and tell me.

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,880
I quarreled with Mark that night.

175
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,260
And Ai.

176
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,400
Okay, cheers! Cheers.

177
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,520
Aren't you going to drink, Thames?

178
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,180
No, I need to control my weight.

179
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
Why are you so serious? Just have a little.

180
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,710
You won't gain weight.

181
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,520
You’re the one who should chill down.

182
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,850
Don't you have a TV show tomorrow morning?

183
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,460
Right.

184
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,360
But I've tried my best.

185
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,760
And I’ll never be as good as you.

186
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,830
Why should I care?

187
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,480
Hey?

188
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,830
Why did you say that?

189
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,040
That's why you'll never be like Thames.

190
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,740
Ai, what did you just say?

191
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,500
Mark, what you’re doing now

192
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,340
is the reason
why you can never compare to Thames.

193
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,310
No one can compare to Thames.

194
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,300
He’s an international superstar.

195
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,540
Calm down.

196
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,770
I'm not hot-headed at all!

197
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,910
But I just pity you.

198
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,690
You don't know anything.

199
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,510
What do I not know?

200
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
What is it?

201
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,430
You’re who you are today
not just because you're good.

202
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,370
But also because you have more people
who love you than I do.

203
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
Eat up, Grandma.

204
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,870
I can't eat.

205
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,640
Please eat some more.

206
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,940
Grandma.

207
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
Grandma!

208
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,570
Grandma! Help!

209
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,390
Grandma!

210
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
Help!

211
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,760
Grandma! Grandma!

212
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,280
Grandma!

213
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,080
Sister Bua, what's wrong?

214
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,780
Grandma!

215
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
I'll be right there.

216
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
What happened to Grandma, Brother Mon?

217
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,780
-She fainted. -What?

218
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,359
She refused to eat anything.

219
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,960
She won’t listen to me. That’s why she fainted.

220
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,140
Stop complaining, Bua.

221
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,170
I can't eat anything.

222
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,360
Then you have to try
and eat more today, Grandma.

223
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,250
I bought you a lot of Northen food.

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,410
Didn't you make it yourself?

225
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,010
I was in a hurry,
so I couldn't make it myself.

226
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,410
I want to eat something delicious.

227
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,020
I miss Thames too.

228
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,740
I hope he’s here to eat with me.

229
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,460
But seeing him lying still,
I can't eat anything.

230
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,010
I don’t want to eat even more.

231
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,690
Grandma, I'll wake up
and join you soon.

232
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,840
Please take good care of yourself, Grandma.

233
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,170
Because...

234
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,670
Just wait a little longer,
Thames will wake up soon.

235
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,790
It's been too long.

236
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,630
I've always thought like you.

237
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,070
But I didn't see him wake up.

238
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,460
We’re almost there, Grandma.

239
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,190
Trust me.

240
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,290
This footage

241
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,460
is from the warehouse
across the “100-Death Curve”.

242
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,610
The place where Thames’s accident happened.

243
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,080
And this.

244
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,570
This is Ai's car.

245
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,080
I think

246
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,750
Ai must know something.

247
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,800
Wait.

248
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,340
How do you know Ai?

249
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,120
How do you know it's Ai's car?

250
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,330
Because I...

251
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,470
I did some research.

252
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,710
-I told you, didn’t I?
-Just for a while, Sister Bua.

253
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,700
I know you're worried about me.

254
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,990
But

255
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,640
I won't do anything stupid.

256
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,960
What do you want me to do?

257
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,900
Can you help me

258
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,610
to ask Ai out?

259
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,860
Is that all?

260
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,370
Yes, that’s all.

261
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,380
Mark.

262
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,830
Hello, Sister Bua.

263
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,810
What brings you here?

264
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,620
Is Thames still unconscious?

265
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,050
That's a weird question.
Don’t you see him lying here too?

266
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,380
How could he wake up?

267
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,650
Where is his phone?

268
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,530
It’s with me.

269
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,810
Can I have a look?

270
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,070
Wait, calm down.

271
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,870
Talk to me. Tell me what happened.

272
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,020
I received this email last night.

273
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,210
But I didn't see anything on the phone.

274
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,840
I still don’t believe
that Ai is the one who did it.

275
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Then don't. We haven't concluded it yet.

276
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,490
Right.

277
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,220
Is there anything else
that stimulated your memory?

278
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
Do you remember anything else?

279
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,160
If not, we can only investigate
what we have now.

280
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:47,290
Can you think of any reason
why Ai would hurt you?

281
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,340
If you don’t count
what I told Ai a few years ago,

282
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,720
then I really can’t think of any reason.

283
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,570
Yes, Sister Bua.

284
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,790
[I’ve helped you ask Ai out.
Meet him around where he works tonight.]

285
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,580
[I'll send you the location later.]

286
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,590
Thank you, Sister Bua.

287
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,020
-Was it Sister Bua? -Yes.

288
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,120
She said she made an appointment with Ai.

289
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,380
Really?

290
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,320
Brother Thanit, did Sister Bua tell you
why she’s asking me out?

291
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,780
She said she just wants to talk to you.

292
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,500
And asked you out for dinner.

293
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,860
Why didn't you ask her what this is for?

294
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,210
Huh? Why? Either way,

295
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,490
you still have to eat, right?

296
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,380
Or do you not want to talk to her?

297
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,870
No, I just want to know why.

298
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,610
What's wrong, Mark?

299
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,450
[Are you at the restaurant?]

300
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,730
Yes.

301
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,050
How did you know?

302
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,470
[Come out and talk to me outside.]

303
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,210
[Don't tell Brother Thanit.]

304
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,530
Okay.

305
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,310
What's up, Mark?

306
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,570
[Thames sent me an email yesterday.]

307
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,030
Am email from Thames?

308
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
I don't understand.

309
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,070
[I'll forward it to you later.]

310
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,080
That's all for now.

311
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,640
Mr. Ai.

312
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,110
Brother Mon.

313
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,660
Where is Sister Bua?

314
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,720
It's not Sister Bua
who wants to talk to you.

315
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,110
It's me.

316
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,930
What do you want to talk about?

317
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,620
I went to look for some information
regarding Thames’s accident.

318
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,510
Then I discovered

319
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,950
that you went to get the CCTV footage
around there too.

320
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,790
Why would you need the CCTV footage?

321
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,310
I just want to know what happened.

322
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,550
Is that all?

323
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,830
Yes.

324
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,810
Then you fought with Thames at the party

325
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,100
and disappeared.

326
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,100
There was no evidence
to prove where you were.

327
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,350
Then you asked for the CCTV footage
from the warehouse.

328
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,380
What would I think?

329
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,120
You must have something to do
with this case.

330
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,250
Mr. Ai,

331
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,060
listen to me.

332
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,670
Are you willing to tell me everything now?

333
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,960
Or do you want me
to give the evidence to the police,

334
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,670
and let them talk to you?

335
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,290
I just want to find out
what happened that day.

336
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,410
The same reason as yours.

337
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,210
Do you suspect

338
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,100
that I framed Thames?

339
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,690
Yes.

340
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,520
Then you have got the wrong person.

341
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,700
Because I will never hurt Themes.

342
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,820
Why are you so confident?

343
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,490
I'm not the one you should suspect.

344
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,700
What is this?

345
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,180
I think I'm quitting, Brother Thanit.

346
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,070
You've always been like this.

347
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,710
Why did you suddenly turn over a new leaf?

348
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,630
I'm not turning over a new leaf.

349
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,000
I just think that it's unnecessary.

350
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,160
Unnecessary?

351
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,620
How is it unnecessary?

352
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,740
You’re still falling behind your friend,

353
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,040
Thames and Mark.

354
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,540
You’re nowhere close to them.

355
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,140
From now on, I’ll work hard
to catch up on my own.

356
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,450
Work hard?

357
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,590
So this is all your hard work can get you?

358
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,500
That's why you can only
get to where you are today.

359
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,370
So you asked me to raise you up in this way.

360
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,620
You don't have to make yourself
sound like a good guy.

361
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,710
Are you doing this
for the sake of your artists?

362
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,910
Aren’t you doing it for your own gain?

363
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,510
I

364
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,210
gain from it,

365
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,440
and you gain from it, too.

366
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,020
Isn't it a win-win situation?

367
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,750
I'm done. I quit.

368
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,560
If you stop, I'll expose you!

369
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,380
If you do, things won’t end well for you!

370
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,880
If I could build you up 
to where you are today,

371
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,720
I could bury you deep down the ground as well.
You ungrateful brat!

372
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,890
Are you sure you’re building me,
but not abusing me?

373
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,040
Then do you think this will end well?

374
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,220
A rising star is being someone’s sugar baby,

375
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,640
in the hope of making himself famous.

376
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,260
Well, you can tell others
that you were forced by me.

377
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,850
But the truth is, you came begging me
because you wanted to be famous!

378
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,120
Let's see if the reporters
calls me out or you.

379
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,820
Screw you, Thanit!

380
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,850
I've arranged for you to meet
a sugar daddy at the hotel tonight.

381
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,800
Don’t forget that.

382
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,060
Brother!

383
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,590
As for your work schedule for this month,

384
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,160
we'll talk about it later.

385
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,240
Both your actual jobs
and your other “jobs”.

386
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,380
-Hey! Who is it? -Damn it!

387
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,360
Mark called and told me

388
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,090
that this document was sent from a cloud storage.

389
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,850
Thames probably tried
to send the email that day.

390
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,890
But it was not sent.

391
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,910
But yesterday,

392
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,100
Thames's phone was fixed,

393
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,350
so the file was sent to Mark.

394
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,010
Then Mark sent it to me.

395
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,500
Brother Mon.

396
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,390
I remember it now.

397
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,680
The one who hurt me is...

398
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,630
Thanit.

399
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,699
[I already heard about it from Bua.]

400
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,420
[You’re okay, right?]

401
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,600
I'm fine, Brother Sing. Don't worry.

402
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,050
[Didn’t you promise
that you wouldn't put yourself at risk?]

403
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,889
But it turned out well, right?

404
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,770
[Don’t do that again.
If not, I'll ask mom to talk to you instead.]

405
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,550
Please don’t.

406
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,909
[Does that mean you’ll do it again?]

407
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,350
No, no.

408
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,870
Just in case.

409
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,370
[So, what happened to that bad manager?]

410
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,699
It’s okay now.

411
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,110
The police have taken care of it.

412
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,600
There will be news soon.

413
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,840
[I'm really tired for you.]

414
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,960
Were you nagged?

415
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,450
Of course.

416
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,250
Hmm.

417
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:28,240
[The police have received an important clue
about the case of the famous young actor,]

418
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,990
[Thames Tinnaphat.]

419
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,930
[They’re interrogating the famous producer
and artist manager, Thanit,]

420
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,370
[who is suspected to be
directly involved with this case.]

421
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,830
Ai, stop.

422
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,260
Why didn't you tell me that you didn't want
to do it from the beginning?

423
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,310
But I couldn't turn Thanit down.

424
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Because it's not that simple, Mark.

425
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,560
What's so difficult, Ai?

426
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,550
Because I was willing to do it when Thanit

427
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,710
first proposed to me.

428
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,100
-Why?
-Because I'm not as talented as you and Thames.

429
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,320
I’m not as good-looking as you two.

430
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:55,960
To be honest,

431
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,560
if no one pushes me,

432
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,000
how am I going to find myself a place
in the entertainment industry?

433
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,980
If that's the case,
then why are you quitting now?

434
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,440
Because I can't take it anymore.

435
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,120
You can't take it anymore

436
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,210
because you know it's not right.

437
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,950
And that's not something you would do.

438
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,270
So what?

439
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,930
You’re just trying to make me feel better

440
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,340
for thinking of quitting it.

441
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,070
Even though I just did something like that
last night.

442
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm such a hypocrite.

443
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,850
Then what right do I have to say
that Thanit's a bad guy?

444
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,760
I won't judge you.

445
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,750
And I don't care

446
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,830
whether you are good or bad.

447
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,040
Because as long as you’re with me,

448
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,970
you'll always be safe.

449
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,600
Is it really over?

450
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,180
Yeah.

451
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,590
We can catch the bad guy

452
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
and change your fate.

453
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,870
You should be back to your body

454
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,630
on your birthday.

455
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,320
But I feel a little sad.

456
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,020
Why?

457
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,880
I don't know.

458
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,070
I never thought that it was going
to end this easily.

459
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,930
Don't you want to go back to your body?

460
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,270
Do you enjoy being a wandering soul?

461
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,760
I want to go back.

462
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,510
But I'm scared.

463
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,830
What if we can't be together like now,
once my soul returns?

464
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,940
You couldn't remember anything

465
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,120
when your soul left your body, right?

466
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,660
Yes, I only had vague

467
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,350
and incoherent memories.

468
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,760
It's like a dream.

469
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,050
If so,

470
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,480
can you promise me

471
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,160
that

472
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,490
you'll do anything to make me remember you?

473
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,330
What if you don't want to see me?

474
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,120
What should I do?

475
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,220
No way.

476
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,250
Things are so beautiful when I am with you.

477
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,080
That's why I don't want it to end.

478
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,570
♫You turn every gloomy day into a bright day♫

479
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,840
You haven’t promised me yet.

480
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,690
♫Your voice is like a song echoing in my heart♫

481
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:28,870

♫You make the whole world smile♫

486
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,260
Alright, Mon. Don't worry.

487
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,860
Yes. I've taken Grandma to a hotel nearby.

488
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,140
Then she won't have to travel that far.

489
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,760
I'll sleep here too.

490
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,690
Okay.

491
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,510
Okay, see you later.

492
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,960
Stroke.

493
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,810
Facial paralysis, difficulty speaking,

494
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,730
and limbs weakness.

495
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,130
Call 1609.

496
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,220
Chularat 3 Cerebrovascular Disease Center.

497
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,830
Grandma.

498
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,940
Grandma!

499
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,500
Grandma, what's wrong?

500
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,260
Grandma!

501
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,660
Grandma, are you okay?

502
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,820
Grandma! Grandma!

503
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,760
Grandma, I'm going in.

504
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,210
Grandma.

505
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,460
Grandma, what's wrong?

506
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,800
Grandma!

507
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,430
Grandma.

508
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,870
Is it a stroke?

509
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,320
Grandma!

510
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,720
Hello. Is this Chularat 3 Stroke Center?

511
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,390
I think Grandma is having a stroke.

512
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:55,330
Can you send an ambulance to pick her up?

513
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,940
Her name is Wimon Thanatikarn.

514
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,220
She’s registered.

515
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,450
We’re at…

516
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,900
The hotel across the hospital.

517
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,120
Please hurry.

518
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,910
Okay.

519
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,820
Okay, thank you.

520
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,700
Grandma! Grandma!

521
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,940
Grandma.

522
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,540
-Hello, Doctor. -Hello.

523
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,220
How is the patient?

524
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,900
Grandma just suddenly collapsed.

525
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,480
Her body is stiff and her eyes are yellow.

526
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,450
Let me have a test on her first.

527
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,750
Hello, what's your name?

528
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,310
It's okay. Can you please raise your left arm?

529
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,160
-Raise your left arm.
-Can you do it, Grandma?

530
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,560
Yes, keep it up.

531
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,130
Good. Can you please raise your right arm?

532
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,460
Not on the right side.
Please raise your left foot and show it to me.

533
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,250
Raise it high and keep it up.

534
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,320
Okay. Can you please raise your right foot?

535
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,700
She can’t move her right leg.

536
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,600
I suspect
that it’s a cerebrovascular-related disease.

537
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,130
Next, we'll send the patient
to undergo the MRI brain scan.

538
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:52,910
Okay.

539
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,380
Please take the patient to her room.

540
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,670
The patient has an ischemic stroke.

541
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,850
We've treated the blood clots.

542
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,780
The patient is safe now.

543
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,040
Thank you so much, Doctor.

544
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,330
Don't worry.

545
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,920
[In the next episode]

546
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,540
I think I saw something.

547
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,140
What?

548
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:45,920
Brother Mon.

549
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,950
There’s a car in front of my house.

550
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,120
My dad will help you flee the country.

551
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,350
Meet me at the pier tomorrow.

552
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,000
You want Mon
to be the bait instead of Ai, right?

553
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
-What? -Hey!

554
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,120
-Brother Mon! -Agh!
