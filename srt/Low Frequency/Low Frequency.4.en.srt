[Low Frequency]

3
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,690
-Wait.
-Okay.

4
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,060
Are you really going to eat with Ton?

5
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,430
Yes.

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,810
I'm confused. What's going on?

7
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,289
He just wanted to treat me to a meal to show his gratitude.

8
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,960
Why would he treat you to dinner when the job is not even done?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
And you agreed?

10
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,880
Yeah, this is a rare opportunity.

11
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,260
Then how are you going to investigate?

12
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,640
Are you going to search his bag or steal his phone?

13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,920
Well, I haven't told you where he asked me out for dinner.

14
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,960
Where?

15
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,270
Excuse me.

16
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,410
Excuse me.

17
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,579
Come in.

18
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,530
Wait over there, Mr. Mon.

19
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll make you something delicious.

20
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,880
Okay, Mr. Ton.

21
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,430
We took this photo when we were still close.

22
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,530
I don't think this is going to work.

23
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,020
I can't find anything.

24
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,130
I don't understand what you're looking for.

25
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm looking for receipts, photos

26
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,190
or any other evidence that can prove

27
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,920
that he was close to the crime scene that day.

28
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,060
But we all keep our photos on the phone now.

29
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,080
I searched online, but I couldn't find anything.

30
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,170
So I think it should be with him.

31
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't think it'll work.

32
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,320
Let's go home, you don’t need to eat with him.

33
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,960
What if he poisoned the food?

34
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,390
Are you worried or jealous?

35
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,630
Well...

36
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,250
It’s both.

37
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,270
Don't worry. I'm leaving soon. Just for a moment.

38
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,030
Are you leaving, Mr. Mon?

39
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,470
Oh.

40
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,170
It's okay. I’m about to have a meeting.

41
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
But it’ll be a while.

42
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,230
The dishes are ready.

43
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,560
Have a taste.

44
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,540
Okay.

45
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,970
Ai, what are you doing here?

46
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,500
Mark.

47
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,800
I should be the one asking you.

48
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,290
What are you doing here?

49
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,190
Why are you following me?

50
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,950
Are you a stalker?

51
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,300
Ai, didn’t you promise me you wouldn't do it again?

52
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,260
Can you stay out of this?

53
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,590
Sorry, Mr. Mark.

54
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,970
Ai has something to do.

55
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,230
We'll get going.

56
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,940
-Thank you for the food.
-Let's eat.

57
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,540
It's delicious.

58
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,320
-Try some more.
-I want some tomatoes.

59
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,360
How is it? Is it good?

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,270
It's so good.

61
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,190
Tell me if that’s not enough.

62
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,010
I've cooked a lot for you.

63
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,220
Actually, it’s already an honor that I get to taste the food

64
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,140
cooked by a top global chef like Mr. Ton.

65
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
What are you talking about? That’s nothing.

66
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,450
I offered to treat you as a “thank you” myself.

67
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,250
I have something to ask you too.

68
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,500
You said you'd buy me a meal to thank me.

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,730
The renovation of your house hasn't finished yet.

70
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,159
What do you want to thank me for?

71
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,530
Well,

72
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,010
I have a favor to ask you.

73
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,310
Can you come into this room with me?

74
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,190
Okay.

75
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,690
Come in, Mr. Mon.

76
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay.

77
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,860
Do you remember this room?

78
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,310
Yes.

79
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,710
It’s the second bedroom that you wanted to make the guest room.

80
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,180
Yes, but actually,

81
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,470
I didn't mean to leave this room to the guests.

82
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,570
I’m going to make it…

83
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,510
My daughter's bedroom.

84
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,630
-Your daughter's room?
-Yes.

85
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,260
But I can't tell you this in the office.

86
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,590
Why?

87
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,730
Because Mr. Yak knows my family.

88
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,350
I've been secretly married in Italy for a while.

89
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,370
But I didn't dare to tell my family.

90
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,030
This is beyond my expectation.

91
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,950
What do you mean?

92
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,180
I mean...

93
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,840
I didn't expect someone like Mr. Ton to hide something.

94
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,460
My family has planned it for me. After I graduate,

95
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,050
I'm supposed to marry someone

96
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,990
from a family that my mother knows.

97
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,020
But now that things have already happened,

98
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,700
I don't know how to tell my family about them.

99
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,750
Only a few family members know

100
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,980
that I’m back in Thailand.

101
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,500
If that's the case,

102
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,110
why are you telling me this?

103
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,060
You know that I know Thames

104
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,580
and also your relatives.

105
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,190
I really like your work.

106
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,220
And I think that one day,

107
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,520
I have to tell everyone about this.

108
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,160
I just don't know how to say it.

109
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,360
I think today is a good opportunity.

110
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,650
So I'll start by telling you.

111
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,250
Aren't you afraid I'll tell this to your family?

112
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,380
I have come to this stage.

113
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,420
What will happen will happen.

114
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
If that’s the case,

115
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,680
you can rest assured.

116
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,420
I won't tell anyone.

117
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,770
Thank you very much.

118
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,960
I'll design this room beautifully.

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you for everything.

120
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,120
It’s my pleasure.

121
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,690
Mr. Mon, wait!

122
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,820
I'll wait for you outside.

123
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,380
Thames.

124
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,250
What?

125
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,560
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,930
I won't forgive you.

127
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
I know you don't want to see me.

128
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,580
But you still showed up anyway.

129
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,290
But I really don't understand

130
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,350
why I did so many bad things to you at that time.

131
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,020
To be honest,

132
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,080
I wanted to apologize and talk to you about this.

133
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,160
But when I saw you at the mall that day,

134
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,520
I couldn't say it.

135
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,100
When I want to tell you now,

136
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,630
you are unconscious and lying here quietly.

137
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm such a coward.

138
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,620
When you wake up,

139
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,180
I’ll come to apologize to you again.

140
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,880
But you have to wake up first.

141
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,630
Okay?

142
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,340
Thames.

143
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,130
Do you remember?

144
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,320
I almost burned the kitchen

145
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,600
when we cooked at our aunt’s house.

146
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,080
Who would have thought I'd become a chef now?

147
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,900
When you wake up, you must try my dishes.

148
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,150
Even if you're still angry at me or hate me. Even if you won't forgive me,

149
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,860
you have to wake up.

150
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,580
I’ll treat you.

151
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,790
I'm leaving.

152
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,070
Okay.

153
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,670
I'll definitely go!

154
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,990
I'm going to eat up your restaurant, you jerk!

155
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,980
Screw you, Ton.

156
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,930
I don't think Mr. Ton is a bad guy.

157
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,010
Why are you so sure about it?

158
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,860
I felt it.

159
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,790
How could you just leave him alone in the room with me? What if he chokes me?

160
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,190
I was watching.

161
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,740
So you saw...

162
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,670
I saw everything.

163
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,930
The reconciliation of two cousins.

164
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,500
Gosh, this is so awkward.

165
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,260
I think Mr. Ton should be the one saying this.

166
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,710
Yes, you saw how awkward I was too.

167
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,360
So the brother you told me about is not Mr. Ton, right?

168
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,810
How could it be him?

169
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,940
I told you, my brother is dead.

170
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,050
Yes.

171
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,580
I thought you meant that he had been erased from your life.

172
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,470
My half-brother actually died.

173
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,500
Ton is my cousin.

174
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,200
That's great.

175
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm glad that this accident was not caused by the hurt between your family.

176
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,570
-What are you looking at?
-The date.

177
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,890
On the day of your accident,

178
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,710
Mr. Ton wasn't in Thailand.

179
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,850
Is this an old photo?

180
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,610
I've confirmed with Mr. Yak.

181
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,930
He really flew there once

182
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,440
and came back for a meeting.

183
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,520
Then maybe it's really not him.

184
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,460
Mark and Ai are the only ones left.

185
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,020
Hi.

186
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,930
What have you got?

187
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,579
Calm down, Mon.

188
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,660
I have a lot of news, my friend.

189
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,540
What is it?

190
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,930
Mark went to see an actor named Ai a few days ago.

191
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,440
They were in front of the hotel in the city center.

192
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,690
What were they doing there?

193
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,930
I don't know either.

194
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,840
I saw them part after saying goodbye.

195
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,760
What's next?

196
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,140
Nothing happened that day.

197
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,320
-Mark went home to sleep.
-What?

198
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,940
You said you had a lot of news. That’s all you got?

199
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,740
Mon, the important part is what happened after that.

200
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,140
When Mark doesn't have a job,

201
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,570
he likes to sleep at 4 a.m. and gets up at 10 a.m.

202
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,050
He doesn't like to take a shower before going to bed.

203
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,950
And he always brings liquor home.

204
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,440
If you dig into his trash can, you'll find that he likes instant food.

205
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,650
He doesn't have a water filter at home.

206
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,880
And he likes to buy many bottles of water at once.

207
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,790
Usually, he doesn't wear clothes according to the lucky color.

208
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,570
And every time he goes out,

209
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,830
-he likes to drive the car with the number…
-Wait.

210
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,890
-What did you look into?
-How was it?

211
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,240
It's so detailed.

212
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,120
I haven't mentioned his favorite water brand and his favorite food yet.

213
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,340
Were you there to investigate or to be a stalker? You know him so well.

214
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,190
That's because you told me to investigate it thoroughly.

215
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,700
I asked my dad's subordinate to watch his house

216
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,930
and followed him 24 hours a day.

217
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,960
It's too detailed.

218
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,570
But I don't need it at all.

219
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,260
Were you expecting me to break into his house? That's all I got.

220
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,670
By the way, Mon.

221
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,730
Perhaps the secret is in his house?

222
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,950
-Should I get inside?
-Uh.

223
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm just kidding.

224
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,180
Don't do that.

225
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,140
I don't want you to get famous for breaking into a celebrity’s house.

226
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,270
Mon, trust me. I think we should get inside.

227
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,570
No, please.

228
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,120
Where did you get my number?

229
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,870
Well...

230
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,560
Thames gave it to me before the accident.

231
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,280
Thames?

232
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,830
Forget it.

233
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,360
So what do you want to talk about?

234
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,590
Well...

235
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
I’m working with Thames’s manager.

236
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,320
I want to talk to you

237
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,630
about the night of Thames’s accident.

238
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,860
But the police said it was an accident.

239
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,700
But maybe that's not the truth.

240
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,240
Are you suspecting that someone staged the accident

241
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
and framed Thames?

242
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,460
This is real life, not a movie.

243
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm not sure

244
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,910
about that accident.

245
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,850
But

246
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,540
I believe that someone

247
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,700
must have framed him.

248
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Let me put it this way.

249
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,460
I’ve got some evidence.

250
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,620
What do you want from me?

251
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,970
I just want to know what happened

252
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,990
after you quarrelled with Thames that night.

253
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,670
You're not suspecting

254
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,170
that I was the one behind it, right?

255
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,980
That depends on your answer.

256
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,330
After I quarrelled with Thames that night,

257
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,570
he left.

258
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,100
So did Ai.

259
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,400
I was extremely drunk.

260
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,820
When I woke up again, I was already at home.

261
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,010
That's all.

262
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,550
Well,

263
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,490
can I ask you something?

264
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,100
What were you arguing about with Thames?

265
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,570
Are you a detective or what?

266
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,960
I just want to know.

267
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,240
It's about the terrible things he did to me.

268
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,000
What was it?

269
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,000
You don’t need to know.

270
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,400
You just need to know that he's a jerk.

271
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,810
To be honest, I don't want him to wake up.

272
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,530
Is that all?

273
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,240
I'll get back to work.

274
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,760
Uh, okay.

275
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,290
I don't understand.

276
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,930
What have I done to him that he hates me so much?

277
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,450
Sometimes, we hate each other

278
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,980
because of those trivial things we’ve overlooked.

279
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,010
Try to think about it.

280
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,540
But to me,

281
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,450
he's my most trusted friend.

282
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,310
But I don't think we can exclude him from the list of suspects yet.

283
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,500
He had a motive.

284
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,560
But he proved that

285
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,220
Mark was drunk that night,

286
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,070
and he fell asleep on the table.

287
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,200
Many people saw him.

288
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,280
There is evidence and witnesses.

289
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,350
Is it possible that he didn't act alone?

290
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,660
That's what I'm thinking.

291
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,930
Now, only Ai is left.

292
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,670
If Mark teamed up with others to hurt me,

293
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,490
it couldn't be Ai, no matter what.

294
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,330
Why are you so sure?

295
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,190
Because I know

296
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,720
that Ai is not like that.

297
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,460
Ai, can I ask you something?

298
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,620
What?

299
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,890
You didn't go home right away after my quarrel

300
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,880
with Thames just because you were tired, right?

301
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,800
Mark, what are you trying to find out?

302
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,140
Someone sent by Thames's manager, Bua, came to me today.

303
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,340
He suspected

304
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,120
that Thames’s accident might not be an accident.

305
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,730
So you think I did it?

306
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,870
Mark.

307
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,580
Me? Hurting Thames?

308
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,220
No way.

309
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,290
Mark.

310
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,620
Please.

311
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,150
Please do this for the sake of Thames and me.

312
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,890
But...

313
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
You want me to give up the leading role to Thames?

314
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,960
Ai.

315
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,720
This is not a small matter.

316
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,940
But you already have lots of fans.

317
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,170
Thames has to go for casting after casting.

318
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,100
He hasn't even debuted yet.

319
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,360
But he should fight for it through his ability.

320
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,720
What about our promise

321
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,340
to get into the entertainment industry together?

322
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,530
But things don’t work like that, Ai.

323
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,900
Did Thames ask you to do that?

324
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,830
Why will there always be someone telling me what to do

325
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,560
when I’m trying to do something?

326
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,970
Think about it.

327
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,350
Maybe I made the decision myself.

328
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,740
Because the Ai I know

329
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,920
won’t tell me to give up my dream for others.

330
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,800
Right.

331
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,620
You will never hurt him.

332
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,500
Then why do you look so nervous?

333
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,350
I’m not.

334
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,470
You’re overthinking.

335
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,660
You can't hide it from me.

336
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,930
You know it too, don't you?

337
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,680
I know everything about you.

338
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,310
But I can't get rid of the suspicion either.

339
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,300
Could it be that I was so drunk that day

340
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,680
that I did all that to him?

341
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,620
When you were that drunk? No way.

342
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,440
Come here.

343
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,110
Why didn't you think about it before doing it?

344
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,870
What if you’re caught?

345
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,260
Then I’ll have my dad handle it.

346
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,000
Keep your voice down.

347
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,720
Stop with these “my dad” jokes.

348
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,200
Who is your dad? The prime minister?

349
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,500
Haven’t I told you that my dad is a mob boss?

350
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,310
If I call him,

351
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,800
the whole department will have to worship my dad with hampers.

352
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,470
Forget it.

353
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,170
Stop bragging.

354
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,630
Don't do it again.

355
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,620
About my dad?

356
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,490
I meant sending someone to break into others’ houses.

357
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,340
Okay.

358
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,010
Are you going to stand there and criticize me?

359
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,030
Or do you want to know what I got from Mark's house?

360
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,460
What is it?

361
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,800
Their shocking couple photos.

362
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,150
So what?

363
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,550
Aren’t you suspicious?

364
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,990
Why are there only photos of Mark and Ai

365
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,830
but no photos of Thames?

366
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,030
Not to mention that the three of them are good friends.

367
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,710
I investigated

368
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,150
and found out that Mark doesn't like Thames at all.

369
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,300
I know that.

370
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,180
Then do you know why he doesn't like him?

371
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,680
Why?

372
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,730
Brother Mon.

373
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,449
Brother Mon!

374
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,969
What's wrong?

375
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,179
Thames.

376
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,449
What’s wrong?

377
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,429
About the accident.

378
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,710
you said you’ve told me everything, right?

379
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,860
Yes.

380
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,699
What about your relationship with Ai?

381
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,350
Uh.

382
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,040
Well...

383
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,100
I didn't tell you because I didn’t think it was important.

384
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,280
Do you understand what “everything” means?

385
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,000
Everything means all of it.

386
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,140
If you don't tell me everything, how can I help you?

387
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,570
I'm sorry.

388
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Brother Mon!

389
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,160
Brother Mon!

390
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,760
Brother Mon.

391
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,930
Brother Mon!

392
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,630
Brother Mon!

393
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,250
Brother Mon, talk to me.

394
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,760
Brother Mon!

395
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,130
Brother Mon!

396
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,600
No, I won’t!

397
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,750
Brother Mon.

398
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,180
Can we please talk?

399
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,690
Brother Mon.

400
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,410
Why didn't you tell him from the start?

401
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,460
I didn't know how to tell him, uncle.

402
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,940
And if I did, I wasn’t sure if things would get worse.

403
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,020
That’s why you’re having a problem now because you didn't tell him.

404
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,210
Uncle.

405
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,730
Have you ever pissed him off?

406
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,380
I would never.

407
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,900
We only started to talk more after you were here.

408
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,460
How should I coax him?

409
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,180
I'm not eating.

410
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,020
Mon, are you okay?

411
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,880
Yes, I'm fine.

412
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,490
What's wrong? Did anything happen?

413
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,220
You left the office in a hurry. I thought something happened to you.

414
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,150
Oh, I'm fine.

415
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,430
Okay, then.

416
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm glad you're okay. I’m hanging up.

417
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,670
Hey, wait.

418
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,320
What is it?

419
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,990
If I’m angry

420
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,080
because I found out

421
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,870
the person who has nothing to do with me didn't tell me about his ex,

422
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,250
what does that mean?

423
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,100
What's going on?

424
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,420
Who made my Brother Mon’s heart flutter like that?

425
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,330
Hey!

426
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,580
I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

427
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,240
So am I. You care about him.

428
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,390
But it doesn't make sense.

429
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,670
Why would I care about him?

430
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,200
Because he's not just anyone to you.

431
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,160
Really?

432
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,650
If you don't think anything of him,

433
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,540
why would you be so concerned and angry at him?

434
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,110
I think I know why you left in such a hurry.

435
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,850
You're good at guessing.

436
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:27,630
Yeah, my friend. I hope that guy wakes up soon.

437
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,310
Okay.

438
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,070
Is that what I’m thinking?

439
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,440
Are you asleep?

440
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,700
Hey, uncle.

441
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,760
What are you doing here?

442
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,450
To accompany you.

443
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,920
Accompany me?

444
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,910
Why would you?

445
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:14,750
You said you’re afraid of ghosts when you’re alone.

446
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,580
Oh, thank you, uncle.

447
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,250
Just a thank you is not enough.

448
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,230
You have to give me some offerings.

449
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,750
I'm a soul. What can I give you?

450
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,910
Let's wait until you wake up.

451
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,660
Fine. What do you want?

452
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,270
Hmm.

453
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,350
Chicken

454
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,670
and...

455
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,240
I'm tired of chicken and pork.

456
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,880
How about a hot pot?

457
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,180
-Hot pot?
-Yes.

458
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,570
-Do you want a pot with four sections?
-Give me a large portion.

459
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,930
Sure, but you have to give something in exchange.

460
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,290
What?

461
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,980
Once I wake up,

462
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,270
I want some lottery numbers.

463
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,720
Are you crazy? This kid.

464
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,600
A large portion of hot pot isn't cheap, uncle.

465
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,940
I’m just asking for the last two numbers. You can't even give me that?

466
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,080
Fine.

467
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,190
Deal.

468
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,310
Deal?

469
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,680
What is a deal?

470
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,230
A deal means a consensus.

471
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,280
If you agree,

472
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,870
bump my fist with your fist.

473
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,120
That’s right.

474
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,640
-Like this?
-Deal.

475
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,980
Deal.

476
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,630
That's it.

477
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,040
Can we talk about

478
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,140
the last two numbers first?

479
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,860
Are you not angry at me anymore?

480
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,140
Wait!

481
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,890
Brother Mon!

482
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,510
-Brother Mon!
-Yeah?

483
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,780
How many days are we spending in Chiang Mai?

484
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,390
Two days. The 15th and the 16th.

485
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,810
Just two days?

486
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,520
Yes, that's all the days off I can take.

487
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,630
Are you confident that the Venerable Grand Father will help me?

488
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,930
Yes.

489
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,460
I'm quite confident.

490
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,400
The Venerable Grand Father once helped someone like you.

491
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,540
Someone like me?

492
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,030
Yes, it was me.

493
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,810
Eighteen years ago.

494
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,950
So this time,

495
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,350
he will definitely help you.

496
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,440
Think about

497
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,050
what to do when you wake up.

498
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,610
If I wake up…

499
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,100
I might

500
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,390
want to be with you.

501
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,200
As if you're not with me right now.

502
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,520
No, I don’t want to be with you as a soul. I want to actually live with you.

503
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,650
Do you know that you're cheesy?

504
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,570
Do you know that you're tight-lipped?

505
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,110
How am I tight-lipped?

506
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,730
You were mad at me about Ai that day because you got jealous, right?

507
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,390
What do you mean?

508
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,170
Do you want me to get mad again?

509
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,410
I won't make you angry again.

510
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,250
Because I won't make you feel jealous again.

511
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,290
How?

512
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,210
Well,

513
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,800
I want you to believe that I no longer have feelings for Ai.

The accident should be solved where it happened.

537
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,850
Once everything fulfils the condition to end the cycle of Karma, it could be solved.

538
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,990
What will happen if you don't help him?

539
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,060
He could die.

540
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,270
Mon!

541
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,170
Are you really going to open your third eye?

542
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,000
