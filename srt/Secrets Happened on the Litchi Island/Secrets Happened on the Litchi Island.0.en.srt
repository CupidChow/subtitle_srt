00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:11,375
"Secrets Happened on the Litchi Island"

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello bro.
Have you arrived?

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
I'll ask Chen Li to pick you up.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,391
I am...

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,895
Listen to me!

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,335
One Le coin is equal to 10 yuan.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,320
Don't rob!

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Mr. Dandan, take the children slowly.

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,280
I forgot about my brother.

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,626
Xiao Zhi!

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,920
It's okay, I'll buy you a new one.

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,040
Let's go!

13
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,853
Then pay for it.

14
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,450
What's it to me?

15
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:55,988
I was just about to call you

16
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,595
when Chen Li shone a flashlight in my face.

17
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:04,659
And as my hand slipped,

18
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:05,920
the phone dropped and got smashed.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,240
Isn't it Chen Li's fault?

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Bro.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
How long have I been on the phone with you?

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,695
Your bro has already forgotten about you.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,712
Chen Li!

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
Count the thing
about the mobile phone on me.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,579
As for the rest,
you can figure it out by yourselves.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
Nie Xiaolong!

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,840
It was you who asked me to come
to summer camp as a teaching assistant.

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,520
It's really not my idea.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,477
Chen Li!

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,704
Count this on me too.

31
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,520
Drink more?
No.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,566
Those teaching assistants
who came last year can't come

33
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,706
because examinations for schools.

34
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,563
So I thought of Xiao Zhi.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,215
Hey, Xiaozhi.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Hungry?

37
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,400
Let me make something delicious for you.

38
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:46,117
Okay.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,204
Chen Li!

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,438
Why don't you usually
try to court my favor?

41
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,680
You don't call me brother either.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Xiaodu Mom.
Don't worry.

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,070
He gets along well with his classmates.

44
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,175
Do you live with your brother?

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I don't live with him.
He snores and grinds his teeth
while sleeping.

46
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,680
Nie Xiaozhi!

47
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,403
Hurry up!

48
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,880
Teacher Daxiong.

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,960
My brother has arrived.

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,160
Zhang Chu Mom, don't worry.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Teacher Dandan has received him.

52
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,689
It's starting again.

53
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:45,118
I'm going to check the dormitory.

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,840
What's up?

55
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm applying a facial mask.

56
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,106
My brother is an actor.

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
So I'm borrowing his mask for a while,
do you need it?

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,480
No, thank you.

59
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,528
What's his name?

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,184
Do you remember?

61
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,965
Come in and wash up!

62
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,360
Towel!

63
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,348
Nie Xiaozhi, go downstairs
to have breakfast.

64
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,286
Morning.
Morning.

65
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
Breakfast is ready.
Okay.

66
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,640
You won't get lost during the day,
will you?

67
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Not sure.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Let me go with you.

69
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,050
It's mine.

70
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,680
Don't snatch, okay?

71
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,960
Don't snatch!

72
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,989
Here's more.
Don't snatch!

73
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
I'm going crazy.

74
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
It's too noisy inside.

75
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,411
Eat here.

76
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Is one cup enough?
That's enough!

77
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
Don't want this.

78
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,560
Don't you like children?

79
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't like them, too noisy.

80
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,567
I like mature ones.

81
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,450
Then you should have an older brother
instead of a younger brother.

82
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,850
Teacher Yue, do you need my help?

83
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,235
Take a hike!

84
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:32,872
Is Xiaozhi your biological younger brother?

85
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, but I always suspect that
he was piked up by my mother.

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
My mom doesn't admit it.

87
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,739
He's much better-behaved than you.

88
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,280
Really?

89
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,887
Xiaozhi, go and help pick
some wax apples back later.

90
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,146
Okay.

91
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
I'll go with you.

92
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,575
Oh.

93
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
It has no taste when eaten directly.

94
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Wait for me to make
licorice wax apples for you.

95
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:17,720
Chen Li.

96
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
Do you think my brother
hasn't been quite right recently?

97
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,156
It's a bit off.

98
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,482
Is Teacher Yue from your school?

99
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,960
No, she is Teacher
Ziqin's teaching assistant.

100
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,938
She seems older than my brother.

101
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:33,563
Exactly.

102
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,942
It really seems that my bro
likes elder brothers and sisters.

103
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:39,105
Elder brother?

104
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
I mean to say

105
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
my brother likes to get along
with older people.

106
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,889
That's why he doesn't like me.

107
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,840
The wax apple?

108
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Here it is.

109
00:09:57,552 --> 00:09:58,403
Let me do it.

110
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,841
Let's go.

111
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,075
Whoever grabs it again
will have Le coins deducted!

112
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:13,434
Is it right this time?

113
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,872
Kids, come here to get your name tags.

114
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,864
Wait. I'm going to
show off my cooking skills.

115
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,455
Xiaozhi, which school did you graduate from?

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Primary School No.1.

117
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,200
Xiaozhi is from the same school as me.

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,960
You too?
Right!

119
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,286
Children, come and get the Le coins.

120
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,840
Let me apply it for you.

121
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,638
Here?

122
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,310
Is anywhere else itchy?

123
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,480
Tom for the Group three and group four.

124
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,160
Get ready to start!

125
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:34,080
Get ready!

126
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
The large-scale hide-and-seek
competition on Litchi Island starts now!

127
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:37,665
Start!

128
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,160
Hurry up!

129
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,161
Xiaozhi, I'm nervous.

130
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,270
We should hide separately
and not stay together.

131
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,864
Don't catch me!

132
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,036
I got one!

133
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,106
It's raining, let's go!

134
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,280
Let me.

135
00:12:58,958 --> 00:12:59,680
Come on.

136
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,280
The weather!

137
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,527
We can't stop it, let's run!

138
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:28,497
I'll still get soaked
even if we run over there.

139
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,887
Come on.

140
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,825
Chen Li, who are you trying to seduce
with your swimming trunks on?

141
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,680
Scram!

142
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,403
Hurry up! Don't let my younger brother
catch a cold.

143
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,203
Take a seat!

144
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,130
Xiaozhi, girls would do that.

145
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,512
- Nie Xiaolong!
- Bro!

146
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,942
The sound was right here just now.

147
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you afraid of the dark?

148
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,075
A little bit.

149
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:42,161
Let's go.

150
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,147
Why are we hiding?

151
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,044
If we don't hide now,
we won't be able to explain it clearly.

152
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,403
Go.

153
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:57,833
Play pranks on them.

154
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,090
It seems that it's going to rain.

155
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:13,536
Shall we go back?

156
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,364
Where have you been?

157
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,520
I went out for a stroll.

158
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,680
Just met Xiaolong.

159
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:36,338
Took a stroll together, right?

160
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:40,377
I'm going back first.

161
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,302
Hey.

162
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:48,440
Did you record it?
Yeah!

163
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:52,965
Send me.

164
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,340
I just felt that there was
something wrong with him.

165
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:30,507
Xiaozhi!

166
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,018
Xiaozhi!

167
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,480
The lychee trees hardly bore
any fruit this year.

168
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:49,975
Mmm.

169
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,606
The island owner said that
the trees didn't bloom in spring.

170
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,680
Let me.

171
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
Let me, let me look for it.

172
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,240
Is there any?

173
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,606
Let me see.

174
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,957
There isn't even a single lychee.

175
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:58,067
Really not.

176
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,596
People who have never eaten
freshly picked lychees

177
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:03,309
really can't understand
how delicious they are.

178
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,720
Then shall we check another tree?

179
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,544
Let's go!

180
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,833
Look at this.

181
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,333
Twins?

182
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,942
Don't eat it.

183
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:37,491
No!

184
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,480
I only eat freshly picked ones.

185
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,162
One!

186
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,364
For you.

187
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:30,966
Cheers.

188
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,920
David Hockney?

189
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
You know?

190
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,760
I've seen some.

191
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,320
His painting style is very vivid.

192
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,800
The most famous one is the swimming pool.

193
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:10,335
He painted a lot of swimming pools.

194
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,680
I can't describe his paintings.

195
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,960
Brilliant, vivid, enthusiastic.

196
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,606
No matter what words are used to describe
his paintings, they are not accurate.

197
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,489
There's no need to pursue accuracy.

198
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,410
Nor should you mind inaccuracy.

199
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:52,682
Nature endows us
with the diversity of genes.

200
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,840
We should respect these diverse
and uncertain factors.

201
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,177
For example, every time I enter the water

202
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:01,653
I'm not sure how much splash will be made.

203
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:03,848
It's also beyond my control.

204
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,206
But it can be captured.

205
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:06,680
The moment you draw it

206
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,080
whether it's accurate or not,

207
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,320
it already exists.

208
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,872
They are too noisy on rainy days.

209
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,817
Grilling chicken with lychee wood.

210
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,280
The chicken will have the aroma of lychee.

211
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,450
My bro said that

212
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,270
the island owner's roast chicken can make
vegetarians break their abstinence.

213
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,775
I can already imagine
how delicious it will be later.

214
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,825
It's in the pot.

215
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,280
This fire is beautiful.

216
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,040
I told you so.

217
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,080
No one gave me a seat.

218
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Nobody want to drink anymore?

219
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:36,372
I don't want it.

220
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,200
Here's a seat for you.

221
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,380
Leave it here.

222
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,989
Be careful.

223
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:43,591
Be careful.

224
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,528
Here you go.

225
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,645
Is there no bowls?

226
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Here you go.

227
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,880
Coming!

228
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,973
Here comes the roast chicken.

229
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:55,080
I'm going to start.

230
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,825
Start!

231
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,130
I want to eat chicken legs.

232
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,320
You want to eat chicken legs?

233
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:03,840
I want it, I want it too.

234
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:08,760
You are smart, you are the smartest.

235
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:11,958
You are the smartest.

236
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,000
I was so tired yesterday.

237
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,240
I fell asleep as soon as
my head hit the pillow.

238
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,724
I didn't even notice you weren't in the room.

239
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,215
I had so much fun painting last night.

240
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,800
Can you give me this painting?

241
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,247
If I painted the walls red.

242
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,538
And hang it up...

243
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,560
It can be called Night Fire.

244
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
If the wall is painted blue,

245
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,520
it can be called Deep Sea.

246
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,920
You got it?

247
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,800
Is that hard to understand?

248
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,169
You can have it.

249
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,080
I shouldn't define it though.

250
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
Like the roast chicken last night.

251
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:02,707
Put it there,

252
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
and it's a stove.

253
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:29,122
Wow.

254
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,720
It's too high. We can't reach it.

255
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,400
Our dinner was too greasy last night.

256
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,919
In fact, lemons can also relieve the greasiness.

257
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:49,116
I just want to hit them.

258
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:11,205
Try it, it's delicious.

259
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,026
Xiaozhi.

260
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,120
What's up?

261
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm fine.

262
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,635
What you said the other day,

263
00:31:50,412 --> 00:31:51,652
I thought about it.

264
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,760
Everyone says that
whatever exists is reasonable.

265
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,362
Then as you said,

266
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,338
that's a false proposition.

267
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,229
Xiaozhi, are you listening?

268
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

269
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:28,657
If existence needs to be explained
by whether it is reasonable or not,

270
00:32:30,268 --> 00:32:31,668
then it is not existence anymore.

271
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,620
Just like the birds outside the window.

272
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,174
They chirp outside the window.

273
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,885
We hear their sounds in one way.

274
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,960
But when they hear their own sounds,
it's another way.

275
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,120
However, their sounds never change
just because of who is listening.

276
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,880
Xiao Long, there is not enough butter.

277
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,854
I'll call the courier.

278
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,880
It will take at least forty minutes
for the courier to arrive.

279
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,377
It's better to go out and buy it instead.

280
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,042
There's a restaurant near here,

281
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:55,095
twenty minutes will be enough
for a round trip.

282
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,240
The butter is good.

283
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,175
I also know the boss.
Then I'll ask Chen Li to go.

284
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
You seem to like ordering him around a lot.

285
00:34:01,557 --> 00:34:02,850
He's easy to talk to.

286
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,831
OK.

287
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,198
Let me.

288
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,065
Let's go.

289
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,280
Hello.

290
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,800
Yue Tingting has already told you.

291
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,600
We've come to pick up the butter.

292
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,280
This restaurant is so beautiful!

293
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,920
First time here?
Yeah.

294
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,605
My brother likes to go back
to the countryside.

295
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,790
He doesn't like this kind of place.

296
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,880
OK.
Thanks.

297
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,534
What would you like to have?

298
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,799
This one.

299
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:28,573
Hello, a watermelon iced tea, please.

300
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Assistant Yue!
You've all started eating already!

301
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,289
Look who is back!

302
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,300
You two are slower than the courier.

303
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:35,693
What would you like to eat?

304
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,703
I've blocked my brother.

305
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,680
Liu Bang, pass me on!

306
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,720
Give treatment!

307
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,000
Don't be impatient.

308
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,187
Nie Xiaozhi, where the hell have you been?

309
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:02,046
I've never won playing with you.

310
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,775
You really screwed me over, okay?

311
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,882
Uninstall！.

312
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,718
Whoever doesn't uninstall it is a bastard.

313
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:12,160
Childish！.

314
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,273
Go take a shower,
I'm going to check the dormitory.

315
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
Wake up.

316
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,703
Go and sleep over there.

317
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:27,680
Xiaozhi.

318
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:33,535
Come on,
I'll take you to watch the sunrise.

319
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,695
Can we watch the sunset?

320
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,528
Oh, come on, let's go!

321
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,539
Are you awake?

322
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,859
You'll wake up after watching the sunrise.

323
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,240
Chen Li,

324
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
why did you bring me to watch the sunrise?

325
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,920
Because beautiful things are worth sharing.

326
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, if you shared a room with my brother,

327
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,539
would you have taken him here?

328
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,680
Yes.

329
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,476
The prerequisite is that
he's willing to come.

330
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,867
So comfortable!

331
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:23,476
You two didn't go to bed
but ran to watch the sunrise.

332
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,040
Get out of the way.

333
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:30,524
Here you go.

334
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:35,014
It's all my fault.

335
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,444
Don't like this taste?

336
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:43,782
Wait, brother will buy you medicine.

337
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,320
Come on!

338
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,719
Don't call yourself "brother".

339
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,281
Occupy another's place by force.

340
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,812
Eat it!

341
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:01,797
What are you waiting for?

342
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:05,820
What about Chen Li?

343
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:08,403
He can't come back.

344
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,484
- What's there to see?
- Come here.

345
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,350
Come here!
What is this?

346
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,234
You come here!

347
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:24,680
Hello!

348
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:25,990
Xiaozhi, shall we meet next month?

349
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,215
Ah, it should be okay.

350
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,461
Make an appointment then.

351
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,476
That summer,

352
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:33,883
the island covered with lychee trees
is as lively as a child.

353
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:37,156
I found more than a little happiness
on the island.

354
00:45:37,594 --> 00:45:39,280
It has the flavor of lychee ice honey.

355
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,120
It has the aroma of fruit-wood
roasted chicken.

356
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,440
It also has the sweet and astringent taste
that belongs to youth.

357
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,001
The only pity is that

358
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,120
the lychee trees didn't bloom that year.

359
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:51,644
Let alone bear fruit.

360
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:20,205
Xiaozhi, your phone is ringing.

361
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,000
Hello.

362
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,372
The car will pick you up at the school gate
at 4 pm tomorrow.

363
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:26,237
Oh, got it.

364
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,120
Who was it?

365
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:35,977
My brother, he asked me to do him a favor.

366
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:37,767
It seems that you are not too willing.

367
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:38,836
It's so annoying.

368
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:40,541
I helped him, but I would still get scolded
even if I didn't do it well.

369
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:42,425
Typical straight male.

370
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:44,093
Nie Xiaozhi！.
Who are you looking at?

371
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,808
The eyes are on my face.
I can look at whatever I want to.

372
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,628
Hey, enough!

373
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:49,960
Faggot!

374
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:51,144
Who are you scolding?

375
00:46:58,364 --> 00:46:59,097
Xiaozhi!
Chen Li!

376
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:10,605
What's wrong, are you not happy?

377
00:47:10,846 --> 00:47:12,446
It's nothing, Chen Li.

378
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:13,836
It's been a long time.

379
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,206
It's only been a year, not long.

380
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:20,026
I went out to buy medicine that day
and couldn't make it back in time.

381
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,870
Were you disappointed with me?

382
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:23,805
Nope.

383
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:26,414
My brother should have gone
to buy the medicine in the first place.

384
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:28,164
I'm your brother too.

385
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:34,276
Tell me if you encounter
any trouble in the future.

386
00:47:34,694 --> 00:47:35,774
I'm more reliable than your brother.

387
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,060
Why is there no liquor?

388
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:26,162
Xiaozhan went to pick it up.

389
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,440
Pick it up?
That's right.

390
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,349
Come on, bring the liquor！.

391
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,965
Cheers! Come on！.

392
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:42,520
Don't some people regret
getting married nowadays?

393
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,843
How could there be no one who regrets it?

394
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:45,228
Have you seen the latest movie?

395
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,482
Which one, the Laughing Room?

396
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,302
One has to get divorced
after getting married.

397
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,200
Go on!
What?

398
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,040
We can't see these things online either.

399
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,200
It's all about having a happy family.

400
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,040
I'm not playing. I'm tired.

401
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
I don't think it's interesting at all.

402
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,600
It's all blocked.

403
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,855
This is not allowed to be on broadcast.

404
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,920
You know?

405
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,338
I told you I don't drink alcohol.

406
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:16,068
Pay attention to safety.

407
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:18,076
See you.

408
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:18,781
Xiaozhi!

409
00:49:19,435 --> 00:49:20,235
See you!

410
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:23,612
Let me do it!

411
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,134
Why am I gay? Why is he not gay?

412
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,030
I thought we could be the same as we were
when we met again.

413
00:49:56,446 --> 00:49:58,246
I'm such a loser.

414
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:02,526
I can't even look at him.

415
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,732
When did it start?

416
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:18,246
It didn't start.

417
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,579
Xiaozhi.

418
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,680
Xiaozhi.

419
00:50:27,338 --> 00:50:28,458
He has a girlfriend.

420
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,826
He has a girlfriend.

421
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:41,388
Stop drinking.

422
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,960
Nie Xiaolong!

423
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,880
So you deliberately
asked him to pick me up.

424
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,040
You just made me look bad in front of him
on purpose, didn't you?

425
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,904
Who made a fool of you?

426
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,326
Nie Xiaozhi!

427
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,527
You can't do it yourself,
why are you blaming others?

428
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,168
I'm blaming me!

429
00:51:01,987 --> 00:51:04,095
I blame me! I'm a piece of trash!

430
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,949
I am useless!

431
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:13,895
It's all my fault!

432
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,980
Xiaozhi.

433
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,613
Xiaozhi!

434
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,880
Chen Li is a good person.

435
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,480
He is also a great brother.

436
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,160
But let me tell you,

437
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,640
he can only be your brother.

438
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,375
If you won't stop thinking about this stupid thing,

439
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,120
you are a fucking fool!

440
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:32,676
Let's go!

441
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:42,320
Bro!

442
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,707
Let's go home, okay?

443
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,496
Let me carry you on my back.

444
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,240
(My high school classmate Nie Xiaolong)

445
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,808
(Could you please pick up my younger brother
on the way tomorrow afternoon?)

446
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:54,016
(Just wait at the west gate
of Nanfang University at four o'clock.)

447
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,707
(Why did you say I have a girlfriend?)

448
00:52:58,732 --> 00:53:00,222
(Don't you have one?)

449
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:03,620
(I remember you were in a relationship with
a girl during your junior year in college.)

450
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:04,975
(I even met her.)

451
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,040
(We broke up a long time ago.
I don't have a girlfriend now.)

452
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:16,019
(So you didn't have a girlfriend
during the summer camp either?)

453
00:53:16,044 --> 00:53:17,816
(No, I didn't.)

454
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,769
(If you had a girlfriend,
why would you pick up my younger brother?)

455
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,960
(Forget it. Whatever.)

456
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,640
We still want you to be the producer.

457
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:42,880
Do you really dare to trust me?

458
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,960
I haven't graduated yet.

459
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:45,941
It has nothing to do with who you are.

460
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,920
Whether it can be done well depends on
how much effort you put into it.

461
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,019
We believe in you.

462
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,240
This tree is 500 years old.

463
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:55,417
Many people come here to visit every day.

464
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:56,242
Why is it?

465
00:54:56,597 --> 00:54:57,797
Because it's rare.

466
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,495
For trees that are 500 years old like this,

467
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,960
there are very few
that can be touched and seen.

468
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,880
Therefore what is rare
should be cherished even more.

469
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Like Suisui.

470
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,320
He was born with folded ears.

471
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:11,905
It is a flaw and also a kind of beauty.

472
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:14,675
I like him for his beauty.

473
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,440
But I don't hate him for his flaws.

474
00:55:17,712 --> 00:55:19,272
He came to me.

475
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:21,981
That in itself is
an expression of existence.

476
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
I accept this expression.

477
00:55:24,118 --> 00:55:26,118
But also cherish his existence.

478
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:28,120
So after he left.

479
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,920
I wanted to continue his story
in the form of animation.

480
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,871
Suisui is an angel.

481
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,988
You are even more like his angel.

482
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,217
He will be happy on Meow Star forever.

483
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,320
You will be the same in your world.

484
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,560
Mom Sui, the story
you wrote is very touching.

485
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,800
I cry every time I read it.

486
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,465
Especially before Suisui leaves,

487
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,480
a flock of birds come and stop at the window.

488
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,245
Suisui just stares at them.

489
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,680
It's like he's communicating with them.

490
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
These are real stories.

491
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:07,238
Accept it when it happens.

492
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,168
Even pain is a gift.

493
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,240
Turn another one gay?

494
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,920
Is there a saying in your circle?

495
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,200
It's called Gay guy's small pier.

496
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,120
Are you that gay guy or the pier?

497
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,740
Shut up!

498
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,440
The mouth is on my body.

499
00:56:48,787 --> 00:56:50,227
I can say whatever I want.

500
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:57,323
These are my newly washed clothes.

501
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:59,287
Lao Zhao, go!

502
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,280
Lao Zhao, hold on!

503
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:03,475
Hold on!

504
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,537
Call your parents.

505
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,397
Did something get into your eye?

506
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,155
Let's find a pharmacy later.

507
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,131
Stop rubbing.

508
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,800
I have a rental house.

509
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:02,428
It is due at the end of this month.

510
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,069
Would you like to live there?

511
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,084
The typhoon is coming soon.

512
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:10,037
Let's go.

513
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,858
Take the black pair.

514
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,600
Is the temperature okay?

515
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,740
Yes.

516
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,360
Chen Li.

517
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

518
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,440
I didn't want to tell my brother.

519
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,480
I'm afraid he'll scold me again
if he finds out.

520
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,160
Your brother won't scold you.

521
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,520
I will transfer the rent to you.

522
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,240
Take your time and stay here.
Don't worry too much.

523
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,000
Roll your eyes around.

524
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:01,272
It's alright.

525
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,076
Typhoon is coming.

526
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:25,240
There isn't even a quilt in the house
that's about to be vacated.

527
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:26,840
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

528
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,000
Don't you want to ask me
why I got into a fight at school?

529
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,170
I know about it. Go to bed early.

530
01:00:41,485 --> 01:00:42,858
Xiaozhi?

531
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,740
Xiaozhi?

532
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,303
Nie Xiaozhi! Chen Li!

533
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,201
Xiaozhi!

534
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,360
You're awake?

535
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,332
It's hard to sleep in a different place, right?

536
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,483
It's fine.

537
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,623
Drink some water, take it easy.

538
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:10,989
Get up and have breakfast.

539
01:04:27,884 --> 01:04:28,524
OK.

540
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,760
I got it.

541
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,840
Xiaozhi.

542
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,045
My girlfriend called me
and said there was something wrong.

543
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,775
I'll go and deal with it.

544
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,209
You can have breakfast by yourself.

545
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,756
Drink the soy milk while it's hot.

546
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,162
The toilet paper is over there.

547
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:16,850
(Ten days later, Chen Li's father
passed away.)

548
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,280
He passed away in the afternoon
of the day before yesterday.

549
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,014
Should I attend the funeral or not?

550
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:21,826
What are you going there for?

551
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,240
Chen Li, thank you for helping me out.

552
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,560
My roommate rented a house near the school.

553
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,920
I'd better go stay with him.

554
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,944
I think it would be
more convenient this way.

555
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
I sprained my ankle.

556
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,740
Shouldn't you check on me first
when you came in?

557
01:06:42,217 --> 01:06:44,412
Could you please take care
of my foot first?

558
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:52,280
Stop looking around.

559
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,561
I'm not hiding anyone.

560
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,200
What are you doing here for no reason?

561
01:06:57,974 --> 01:07:00,134
I'm just helping to look after the store
when I don't have classes.

562
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,960
I can't live in the house for free.

563
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,240
Don't you live in the dormitory?

564
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,440
This is the situation.

565
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:15,960
There's always someone in the dorm
looking for trouble with me.

566
01:07:16,326 --> 01:07:17,451
I don't care about them.

567
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:18,996
So I moved to my friend's place to live.

568
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:22,092
Friend? Male or female?

569
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,342
Don't attribute many things
to your own particularity.

570
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:37,292
And don't think that
you're not good enough.

571
01:07:37,317 --> 01:07:39,069
Not everything can be perfect.

572
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:41,443
And not everyone can get what they want.

573
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:43,272
Just be what you are.

574
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,499
Anything beyond that is not you.

575
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:48,563
You are the best in your own world.

576
01:07:52,389 --> 01:07:56,175
(Two years later)

577
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,400
You are asking me this?

578
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,600
I thought you studied genetic engineering.

579
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,360
From a genetic perspective, this is innate.

580
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,920
However, for me,

581
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:09,436
I'm not sure...

582
01:08:11,944 --> 01:08:13,680
whether this is a dependent
stress response or not.

583
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,400
So you came to me.

584
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:17,974
You can't get answers from other people.

585
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:20,297
Because no one knows you better than you do.

586
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,400
The reason you came to me

587
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:26,162
is that you want to find some people to prove
that your views are correct.

588
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:30,402
No matter what the result is,
it doesn't belong to you.

589
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,680
I hope you can know.

590
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,840
Besides seeking the definition
and approval of others,

591
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,240
there is another way to go.

592
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,160
Which is to stop looking outside.

593
01:08:39,185 --> 01:08:41,686
But look inside, look into your own heart.

594
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,122
Be true to yourself.

595
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:49,107
And the answer shall come.

596
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:05,389
Xiaozhi!

597
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,920
Xiaozhi!

598
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:17,558
Chen Li!

599
01:09:18,598 --> 01:09:19,998
Chen Li!

600
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:58,200
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold
when you swim on a rainy day?

601
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,092
It's none of your business.

602
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,061
Are you going to Chen Li's wedding?

603
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:06,966
When?

604
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:08,960
The 19th of next month.

605
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,560
I'll pick you up on the way
if you want to go.

606
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,880
Talk about it later.

607
01:10:17,763 --> 01:10:20,363
Are you going to my graduation
ceremony next week?

608
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:43,826
Xiaolong,

609
01:10:44,521 --> 01:10:47,321
teacher Da Xiong sent several boxes
of lychees from the island.

610
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:48,631
I'll send them to you and Xiaozhi...

611
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:02,717
Xiaolong,

612
01:11:03,108 --> 01:11:05,880
teacher Da Xiong sent several boxes
of lychees from the island.

613
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:07,185
They were all sent to me.

614
01:11:07,836 --> 01:11:09,569
I've been asked to deliver them
to you and Xiaozhi.

615
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:46,560
(Just leave it with you.
I'll drop by to pick it up on my way.)

616
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:24,720
Hello!

617
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,015
Teacher Daxiong sent two boxes of lychees.

618
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,015
- I'll give you a box.
- I don't need that.

619
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,120
Keep it for yourself.

620
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:56,492
Hello.

621
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,680
Did you send over the lychees?

622
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:58,865
I asked someone else to deliver it.

623
01:12:59,598 --> 01:13:01,278
I knew you weren't that diligent.

624
01:13:01,636 --> 01:13:02,836
When are you going to move back home?

625
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:04,440
I've already graduated.

626
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,240
Mind your own business.

627
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:06,342
Tell me the truth.

628
01:13:06,367 --> 01:13:07,787
Are you with that Li Shijia?

629
01:13:07,812 --> 01:13:09,080
Nope.

630
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,382
Then why are you living in his store?

631
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:13,925
I just saw your brother.

632
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:18,924
He came to bring you lychees, right?

633
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:20,474
Yeah.

634
01:13:38,732 --> 01:13:40,092
I've sent you the graduation photo.

635
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:08,374
Xiaozhi.

636
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,540
I might work overtime today.

637
01:14:20,565 --> 01:14:21,845
Look after the store yourself at night.

638
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,140
I'm off.

639
01:14:40,574 --> 01:14:41,374
Chen Li?

640
01:14:43,381 --> 01:14:44,181
Xiaozhi?

641
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:45,204
What a coincidence.

642
01:14:45,724 --> 01:14:46,964
Why are you waiting here for the bus?

643
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,880
My car was sent for maintenance.

644
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,359
So I'll take the bus to work today.

645
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:52,820
Oh.

646
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,906
The company is not too far away.

647
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,740
Let me walk you there.

648
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,000
Okay, it's just one stop away
from the company.

649
01:15:03,976 --> 01:15:04,760
Let's go.

650
01:15:15,822 --> 01:15:17,382
How's your work recently?

651
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,480
It's quite good.

652
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,560
My colleagues are all very kind to me.

653
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,160
Let me know if you need anything.

654
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:28,281
Xiaozhi, did you change your phone number?

655
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,320
I changed after graduation.

656
01:15:44,335 --> 01:15:45,935
You just put "younger bro" as the name?

657
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,968
Or what else?

658
01:15:56,406 --> 01:15:57,240
This is me.

659
01:16:49,046 --> 01:16:49,840
Since childhood,

660
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:52,345
how have we learned what "love" is?

661
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,960
Is it the self disguised
under social labels?

662
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,560
Or is it the sincerity radiating
from our true inner selves?

663
01:17:00,038 --> 01:17:01,598
In the process of stripping
away the disguise.

664
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:04,445
I've been constantly striving
to get rid of fear.

665
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:06,110
However, I can't overcome
the instincts of the flesh.

666
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,742
My heart still beats nervously
on the verge of its endurance limit.

667
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,800
It's just like the moment when a fish
in the water bites the hook and is lifted up.

668
01:17:16,809 --> 01:17:18,169
He should be the same as me.

669
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,249
Suffering yet passionate.

670
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,943
Xiaozhi, you don't look like your brother.

671
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,900
My brother is straight.

672
01:17:45,023 --> 01:17:46,764
Just stop having designs on him.

673
01:17:46,789 --> 01:17:48,149
I'm not having designs on your brother.

674
01:17:49,686 --> 01:17:50,806
I am a 0.5.

675
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:51,988
We have the same preference.

676
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:54,773
0.5 plus 0.5 equal to 1, right?

677
01:17:58,224 --> 01:18:01,180
Bro, Li Shijia took the lychees
and gave them away.

678
01:18:01,205 --> 01:18:02,965
When will you send me another box?

679
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,320
I don't have time to send it to you.

680
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,496
Go to Chen Li.

681
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,942
When did I give away your lychee?

682
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:11,560
Now!

683
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,520
(Damn!)

684
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,960
(I hadn't eaten many
before my roommate gave them away.)

685
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,200
(I'll send you another box.)

686
01:18:47,525 --> 01:18:48,325
Hello.

687
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,396
Xiaozhi.

688
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:52,499
Yeah.

689
01:18:53,118 --> 01:18:55,158
Do you have time tomorrow evening?

690
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:56,964
Let's eat together.

691
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,725
Did you just ask me to have dinner
together tomorrow?

692
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,346
Actually, you can call me.

693
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,385
Well.

694
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,680
No time!

695
01:20:14,213 --> 01:20:15,408
Xiaozhi!

696
01:20:18,519 --> 01:20:19,519
Are you getting married next month?

697
01:20:23,308 --> 01:20:24,148
There's no wedding.

698
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:27,516
Did you want to trick me into coming to
you on my own initiative?

699
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:31,940
I'm not sure about your feelings.

700
01:20:48,825 --> 01:20:50,002
Can you forget?

701
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,221
Those that have existed.

702
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,182
I can't forget it.

703
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:02,753
You can't forget it, so can I?

704
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,738
Existence is just existence.

705
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,205
It is neither right nor wrong.

706
01:21:28,838 --> 01:21:29,930
And it's neither reasonable or unreasonable.

707
01:21:29,955 --> 01:21:30,915
I know.

708
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,240
You already taught me.

709
01:21:39,429 --> 01:21:40,429
It's just that I was too stupid.

710
01:21:59,196 --> 01:22:02,580
It took me three years to have the courage to face you.

711
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:18,697
Fortunately, it's only been three years.

712
01:23:11,334 --> 01:23:14,465
Didn't you say you wouldn't come to
this year's summer camp?

713
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,817
Not coming to the summer camp
doesn't mean not coming to see you.

714
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,528
Assistant Nie!

715
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:24,918
Here!

716
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,551
Why are you shouting?

717
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,489
Let's go!

718
01:23:31,517 --> 01:23:32,117
One!

719
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,600
Two!

720
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,418
Three!

721
01:23:41,247 --> 01:23:46,754
"Secrets Happened on the Litchi Island."

722
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,040
They are too noisy on rainy days.

723
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,000
Genetically speaking.

724
01:26:05,474 --> 01:26:08,280
Toads usually croak louder
in this kind of weather.

725
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,755
It's their...

726
01:26:13,825 --> 01:26:15,122
reproductive behavior.

727
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:16,724
Why are you looking at me
while saying that?

728
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:31,594
(You're the best in your own world)
