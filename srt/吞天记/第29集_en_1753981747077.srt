I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,200

OK, OK, watch for this men and naked men know exactly what they're talking about ^^

19

OK, OK, watch for this men and naked men know exactly what they're talking about ^^

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OK, ok, look for them, I'll check this, wait...

OK, and click the go那 I'll see how I can pull that off.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Hey!

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:11,020
Crown Prince of's

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:22,800
He killed the progression of theład me please details

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,640
A disciple?

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
He killed many people.

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Su Ci,

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Ni Hongyi,

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Zhang Huan.

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
The last one who died

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
was a boy named Wu Yu.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
And a girl named Lan Shuiyue.

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Feng Xueya,

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
the three sides are now united.

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
You're a god of swords.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
It's time to die.

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
You...

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't... Don't kill me.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,760
Sister,

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
help me.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Feng Xueya, once again.

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Wu Yu.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Stop me.

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,560
Wu Yu, help me.

59
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
You brat,

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,800
these spirit energy can help me restore my body.

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
I'll use the power of the Kun's clan.

63
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,960
But you need to eat some small beans.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Are you sure?

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
Just a little bit of small beans?

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Get lost.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
The Demon-Penguin is collecting the spirit energy of the All-Persistent Valley.

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,560
Zhang Jiao,

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,360
what should we do next?

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,720
The Demon-Penguin's range of effect is only in the Demon Tower.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,720
How can it expand the whole Persistent Valley?

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
The Demon Tower

73
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,160
must have a spirit power superior to us.

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,160
Are there any disciples who haven't left?

75
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,480
You can leave.

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
As for the others,

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,160
go back to the clan first.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Little girl,

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,560
this is the little bit of pain you're talking about.

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
You brat,

81
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,280
your field is behind you.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
Field?

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,680
This is the third layer of the Golden Helmet.

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
Transform into a golden helmet.

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,560
The spirit energy of the Demon-Penguin

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
can actually break my golden helmet?

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
You brat,

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,560
it's really lucky to meet me.

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,960
Unlike me,

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,760
I've tried thousands of ways to restore my body.

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
But I failed.

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,560
Little girl.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,960
Little girl, are you okay?

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Stop yelling.

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Let me have a good talk.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you for saving me.

97
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I'll repay you for this favor.

98
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,560
What I did to you before

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
wasn't really to hurt you.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
I just...

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,960
I just wanted to know about you.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,360
Wu Yu,

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,360
do you hate me?

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Are you listening to me?

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,960
You rude brat.

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm not that boring.

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
That means you don't hate me.

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Forgive me.

109
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
Since you've recovered,

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,080
let's go.

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm not going.

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
You haven't answered my question.

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
I saved you

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
because you're a disciple of the Heaven-Slaying Sect,

115
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,080
not because you're Lan Shui Yue.

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Forget it.

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,880
I don't care.

118
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
So annoying.

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
How can a good exit disappear?

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,680
There's someone living in this place where birds don't poop.

121
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Don't make any noise.

122
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
This place

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
isn't the place where ancient Taoists lived, is it?

124
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
My aunt said

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
some Taoists

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
have been practicing in the secret area all their lives.

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,880
They often hide

128
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,280
the supreme secret and treasures.

129
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Maybe

130
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,080
we can get lucky this time.

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Don't run.

132
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
I didn't touch him.

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
This is the forbidden area.

134
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
Damn it.

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
This isn't the place where ancient Taoists lived.

136
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
It's a trap.

137
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I'll kill you.

138
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
It seems that people who are forbidden

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
are extraordinary.

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
Wu Yu,

141
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,680
I think I know these words.

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
No forbidden area, trapped here.

143
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,080
The sword is made of forbidden pieces.

144
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
This is a set of swords.

145
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,680
It seems that this senior

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,080
doesn't care about the forbidden area

147
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
to trap himself here

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
just to practice this set of swords.

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
It seems that as long as you practice this sword,

150
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,880
you can break the forbidden area.

151
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
What does it say?

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,080
Born

153
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Yin and Yang.

154
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
One sword.

155
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
It means

156
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
Born Yin and Yang, one sword.

157
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
Born Yin and Yang, one sword.

158
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,680
Practice this sword

159
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
to remove the bad nature of the stars.

160
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
There is a body of pure Yang.

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
The one who practices it must protect justice

162
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,680
and protect the people for a few days.

163
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
He can't kill the innocent.

164
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Idiot.

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,880
I'm not a body of pure Yang.

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
I can try.

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
You are a body of pure Yang.

168
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
You are really not happy.

169
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I'll read the sword manual for you.

170
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
You practice the sword.

171
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,280
Born Yin and Yang, one sword.

172
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
The practice is natural.

173
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
The weapon is one sword.

174
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
The sword has the new path.

175
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
The path is the sword.

176
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,680
The mirror is made of straw and leads the body.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Yin and Yang.

178
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,680
The two are different.

179
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,680
The mirror guards the heart.

180
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
The mirror leads the god.

181
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,680
The mirror is made of straw and leads the body.

182
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Between the mirror and the mirror.

183
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
The mirror is boundless.

184
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Yin and Yang.

185
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Born Yin and Yang, one sword.

186
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,280
The mirror is made of straw and leads the body.

187
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
The mirror is broken.

188
