1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Kiss, kiss, kiss on the lips

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Kiss, kiss, kiss in the lips

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Kiss, kiss, kiss on the lips

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's特别tt

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For a boy

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
yes

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When I pressed

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And grab the pen

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And you

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
On the moon

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You left

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Episode 2

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They'll believe it if I kill you.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Li Wu!

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lan Shui Yue, don't be so rude!

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She's not Wu Yu's opponent.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Master has taught her the military mission.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She's powerful.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wu Yu will die.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wu Yu is so cunning.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's help her.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Whoever dares to help,

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
don't blame me.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't be afraid.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm happy.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm happy too.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Han Zhong!

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wu Yu!

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When I get the Immortal Root,

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll make sure you die!

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Immortal Root?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you want to break through the five elements of the soul,

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you need to plant the Immortal Root in your body.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Junior, although you only have one element of the soul,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
you're not good at all.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You should have made your plan earlier.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Brother Mu,

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
where can I find the Immortal Root?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The Immortal Valley.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The terrain of the Immortal Valley is complicated.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There are countless demons.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But fortunately,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
they've been tamed by the elders.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There are three demons

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
who are more than four times stronger than the Nings.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They're the ultimate test

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the Immortal Sects use on their disciples.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Although they can't kill the disciples of the Immortal Sects,

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
if they catch them,

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
they'll be tortured.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The demons are so powerful.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The Immortal Sects are not worried

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
that they'll escape from the Immortal Valley together.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Immortal Valley is guarded by the elders of the deep soil.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They can't escape even if they want to.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you for your advice.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to try.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The elders of the deep soil are strange.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When you see them,

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you must be careful.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
in the valley of the Immortal Valley,

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
remember one thing.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't see them with your eyes.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where is Ning Qi Jing?

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It seems that he is the elder of the deep soil

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that my sister mentioned.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Elder of the deep soil,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm not well.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm here to find the Immortal Root.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's so powerful.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's so powerful.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The Moon Reveal.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're good at it.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It turns out that the elder was testing me.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The Moon Reveal.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Moon Reveal.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can leave the valley immediately.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is...

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What?

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't break it.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's quite close to the meat.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Give me two.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's disgusting.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You brat.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you know what the taste is?

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother, are you okay?

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Two Ning Qi Reveals.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm Tang Batian of the Skywind.

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Song Ci.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Grandma's leg.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is really disgusting.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is really disgusting.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is really disgusting.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Brother, you're good.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Be careful.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you hurt?

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The Moon Reveal.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's a good move.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Brother, you're really good.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
May I ask your name?

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Wu Yu.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You...

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're the famous Wu Yu?

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There are many dangers in the valley.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wu Yu, why don't you join us?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But I'm used to it alone.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
As the saying goes,

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
three bad guys will be killed.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We can take care of them when we meet big monsters.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And Song Ci has been to the valley for three times.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She knows the way out.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If you join us,

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
you may find the fairy root first than others.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wu Yu, to be honest,

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I've been pursuing Song Ci for three years and five years.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Today she finally wants to talk to me

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and even has a team with me.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You should do something good

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and show me some respect.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Do something good and show me some respect.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll see what you can do

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
when they sing and dance.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, I'll help you.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sister Song Ci, you heard it.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I convinced Wu Yu to join us.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Brother, you're really something.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Follow me.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Song Ci, I think my cousin is coming.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's about time.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She's much better.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But she hates Tang Batian so much.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's really hard for her this time.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm willing to bet.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Who let her bet and lose?

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's take a break first.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Coming.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wu Yu.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Today,

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we'll never be separated.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Brother Luo,

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you lure them here.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We'll kill them all together.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Nie Kai,

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the sword is not enough.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The god sword is too strong.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Meng Yi, Zi Yan,

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I won't leave any of them.

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
