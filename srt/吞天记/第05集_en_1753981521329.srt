1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Song&MÐ¾ delivered on While I was Baby

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The future is not perfect, the wind is too strong

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The mind is strange, the heart is fake

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Only one side is easy to be old

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I dare to break through the night

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people, the grass and flowers

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I care about you, the winter is here again

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The evening fragrance of the last autumn

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Love and hate are close, grudges and grudges are hard to bear

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Like the night, the soul is confused

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The broken heart is gone, the moon is not in the palm

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Looking back, the world is so beautiful

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't know why you haven't been drinking

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm a little jealous

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have to watch the good show too

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Situ Jin

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Look, the protagonist is here

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good show is starting

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Situ Jin is the cultivation of the six powers of the broken body

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think he's just here to die

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Who am I?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So it's a little grasshopper from Yan Li Feng

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I went to the immortal gate today

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why don't you go back and drink with your grandson

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why don't you go back and celebrate with your grandson?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, I almost forgot.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I killed it by accident.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What a pity.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That 30-year-old snowman.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wu Yue, I'm very kind.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just a light sword.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I pierced his heart.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's just a pity that I'm wearing a white dress.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You go help him calm down.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm dead.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wu Yue, I like your blood.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But you broke the rules.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have to teach you a good lesson.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm a ghost.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm the enemy.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm cold and cold.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're so thick.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I like you.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Otherwise, like Sun Dao Jiu,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll be killed by a sword.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So boring.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I hope you can cut me a few more moves.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That scene is quite wonderful.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll shoot you with a sword.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll cut you like a sword.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll cut you like a sword.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll cut you like a sword.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How could it be?

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Help me.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let go.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't fight back.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm so weak.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm so weak.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Brother, kill him.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You hurt Tong Wen.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Today,

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll help the clan to end the rebellion.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll help the clan to end the rebellion.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're a brother.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You said you'd help the clan.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Today, I'll help you pay back.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll help you pay back.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Brother, you killed him.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't recommend it.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:05,340
Golden

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're hard to match.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
B Patricia.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
My new sword.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ohh.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You stupid,

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
all you care about is improving.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What is it?

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Will you lose if you put your fist one head?

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
you

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
I will do 5 astrological cultivation

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll make the seeking of blood burn in my heart.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll burn the world again.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Brother!

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm coming.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm coming.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So much blood.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't stop it.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Take me out of the Immortal Sect.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This time,

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll take you home.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Brother!

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Brother!

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Raise your head.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I...

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wu Yu, my brother Si Tu Ming...

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I told you,

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
mortals can't be with the Immortal Sect.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's wrong.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mortals can be with the Immortal Sect

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
as long as they become immortals.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Right?

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Si Tu Jin.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Old man,

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
from now on,

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
no matter what the calamity,

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I, Wu Yu, will live.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother!

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother!

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Si Tu Ming is here.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Wu Yu,

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
kill me.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll let you die from the pain of death.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Bring him here.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want you to die with me.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He's my man.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No one can touch him.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Su Yan Li.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How dare you defy the rules

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and defend him?

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've already informed the Hierarch.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Hierarch is coming.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Greetings, Hierarch.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Please let me deal with Wu Yu.

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Si Tu Jin and the others are innocent.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Si Tu Kang is also guilty of the crime.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I, the disciple of the Sword Sect,

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
will practice the righteous and the immortal.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I must be worthy of my heart

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and my sword.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wu Yu,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you killed five people in a row.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You'll be grounded for a year.

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You'll be repaid.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hierarch, Sun Dao is like my biological father.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I want to protect him for seven days.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're so stupid.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Old man,

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the wine is ready.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The snow is so good.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a pity that

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you don't have this blessing.

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You've been taking me back to the tribe for seven or eight years.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You always shout

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that you'll be old when you come back.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I want you to enjoy your wealth.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You always teach me how to live.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look, you're ahead of me.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Old man,

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
have a good trip.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm fine.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Old man.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're the same as the old man.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can't drink and you still want to drink.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You'll follow me from now on.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll call you

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Dao Ye.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to seclude myself from the coffin.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll come to see you a year later.

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll make you proud.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Impossible.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Resurrected?

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're disappointed.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not that easy to die.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The world is in your hands.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The dead will survive.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The little rascal is really alive.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Little shrimp,

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
get me a Martial Soul.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Martial Soul is a creature of the night beast.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll give it to you.
