1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
equals

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
total

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Singney

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to go to the bathroom, but I can't do it.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to go to the bathroom, but I can't do it.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to go to the bathroom, but I can't do it.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was about to leave.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Shouldn't have gone.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The wind blew it away our carAh uhm

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the wind blew it away our carAh uhm

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
at your耶

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
д

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
I do well.

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,980
A place where we can't see or feel you

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:40,360
Engraved in the memories of nights

30
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,100
For our love and effort

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:54,440
This hotel looks like nothing to me

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Episode 16

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Get off! Get off!

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Immortal Sun,

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
have a taste of this Monkey-Ear Wine.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
You bold monkey!

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Somebody!

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I'll break his nose!

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Get off!

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Get off!

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
You bad monkey!

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I won't let you get away with this!

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
This Monkey-Ear Wine

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
is a gift from my dear guest, Dongyue.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
His Majesty was careless

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
and offended the Immortal's favor.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Somebody!

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
What is the purpose of

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
removing these treasures

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
from the Heavenly Palace?

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Since you don't like Monkey-Ear Wine,

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
this gift

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
may be a gift from you.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
It seems that you don't like it either.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Since you don't like it,

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll pick some other things

57
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
and send them to the Heavenly Mountain.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Your Majesty, you're too kind.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I heard that Monkey-Ear Wine is the national wine of Dongsheng.

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Your Majesty, the guest you mentioned

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
is from Dongsheng.

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
You're right.

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
The King of Dongsheng

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
is going to marry Princess Wu You.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
These are the best wine

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
that the King personally picked.

67
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
It's a pity that you don't drink it.

68
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Qi.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Are you suspicious?

70
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
The people of Dongsheng are evil

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
and cruel.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Dongyue has always been righteous.

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
How could he have an affair with such evil monsters?

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
You...

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Don't worry about him.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
The people of Dongsheng

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
are so cruel to us.

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
If we don't marry Princess Wu You...

79
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
If we don't marry Princess Wu You,

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
the Nine-Sixth Army will not retreat.

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I see.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
It's late.

83
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll leave now.

84
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Why are you leaving?

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Why are you leaving?

86
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Immortal.

87
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm lonely in the mountain.

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
How about

89
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I send some beauties to serve you?

90
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
He is not a passer-by.

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Chen, keep an eye on him.

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Dongsheng and Dongyue are in a relationship.

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
There must be something wrong with it.

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
The monster is...

96
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Go.

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Little Fox.

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Little Fox.

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Do you want to play with me?

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
What do you want to play?

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll accompany you.

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
You said it.

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Yes.

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Uncle Zhong, is the wine awake?

105
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
It's awake.

106
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
But those who framed the Crown Prince

107
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
are so mean.

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
You can't get rid of them.

109
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
You followed Ayu.

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
You can understand if you can't swallow it.

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
But Ayu's case is very serious.

112
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
You'd better be careful.

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
How is everyone?

114
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Thanks to you,

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
everyone is much better.

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
But that child is still not well.

117
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll think of a way

118
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
to go to a few more pharmacies and ask.

119
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Thank you for taking us in.

120
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
But don't worry, Miss.

121
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
When you see the Immortals,

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
the child will be saved.

123
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Immortals?

124
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Miss.

125
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
It's almost time.

126
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Uncle Zhong,

127
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I'll leave the medical thing to you.

128
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Yes, Miss.

129
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
My little princess.

130
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Didn't you say you'd put a lantern in the lily box

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
and pray for your dead brother?

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Why did you come to this shabby temple again?

133
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Could it be that

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
there's a dog man

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
who can make you happy?

136
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I just need to be polite to the princess.

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
You have the nerve to talk.

138
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Mi Chang.

139
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I heard that there are a group of refugees in the southeast.

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
There's no one in the capital.

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Did they hide you in there?

142
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
My good sister.

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Tell me.

144
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
I promise I won't report to the Empress Dowager.

145
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
You make me...

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
disgusting.

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Let go of the sword.

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll show you.

149
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Uncle Zhong.

150
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
No.

151
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
You're so bold.

152
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
It's okay to go out of the palace.

153
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
You're still taking the name of the southeast behind the Empress Dowager.

154
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Tonight I'll teach you a good lesson for the Empress Dowager.

155
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Who?

156
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
The... the late emperor.

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
You're the late emperor of the Heavenly Sword Sect.

158
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
You're a traitor.

159
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
You deserve to die.

160
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I think you're handsome.

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
You're in good shape.

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
But the face under the mask is more handsome.

163
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I'll play with you first.

164
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Then I'll eat you.

165
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
You're so annoying.

166
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
He wants to play with you.

167
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Impossible.

168
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
You're a broken-hearted man.

169
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
How dare you play with me in front of my own people?

170
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
You deserve to die.

171
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Be careful.

172
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You're a rotten monkey.

173
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
You deserve to die.

174
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
The mother of Yin and Yang.

175
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
The first name of the world.

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Long Yue.

177
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Long Yue.

178
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Long Yue.

179
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Long Yue.

180
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Long Yue.

181
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Long Yue.

182
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Long Yue.

183
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Long Yue.

184
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Don't kill me.

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I'd rather be your maid.

186
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll serve you forever.

187
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
You don't deserve to beg for mercy.

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Who are you?

189
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
It's you.

190
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
I can't beat them with you.

191
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
It's not a rare brush.

192
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Heaven has changed.

193
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh my god.

194
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I didn't expect such a monster in the capital.

195
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Thanks to that Sun.

196
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Otherwise, the snake demon would kill people in the dark.

197
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Mi Chang.

198
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
You can't die.

199
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Who?

200
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
We can't fight them.

201
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Today, we'll never fight them.

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Luo, you lure them here.

203
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
We'll kill them all together.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Nie Kai, the great dragon.

205
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Five swords are in one.

206
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
The sword of god breaks the heaven.

207
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Meng Yi, Lian.

208
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
We can't leave them.

209
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
