1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,380
Marco ì¹ 

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,240
versatile

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,020
swollen

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,160
busy

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,060
easy

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 16

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
Senior, wake up!

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is this place?

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh no!

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We found the path of the Bear Lee.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,500
The most evil monster in the valley of Xianyuan

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
is this beast.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He's trying to torture the world.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's said

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that every year,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
he has a spiritual protection from the evil disciples.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Senior, don't scare me!

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No!

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So boring.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He fainted before he tried his best.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The quality of these disciples

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is the worst I've ever seen.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Brother, you're only a second-generation student.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why did you go to Xianyuan Valley to find the immortal?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The clan's spiritual power is so strong.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The immortal clan is so simple.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's not a bad thing to have a good preparation.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I heard about this too.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to protect the clan

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
just like my brother.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It doesn't matter

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
what kind of love and affection they have.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What's wrong?

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Nothing.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I just feel like

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
today is another lively day.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, no.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They look so tired.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Follow me.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How dare you break in here?

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're really not afraid of death.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think you two

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
are destined to be in the immortal forest.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why don't you stay

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and be the young master of Lian Dan?

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't expect them to be tough.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It seems that they don't have any means.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't kill me.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I've been practicing here for six hundred years.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know where the immortal is.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm willing to take you there.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Lead the way.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The immortal is down there.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Since it's the immortal,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
then the swordman should have a share.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're following my brother.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Shameless.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This road is not yours.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can walk.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We can't.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're so brave.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you waiting for?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Go.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Boss, I'll go get it.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Damn it.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm scared.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My wind and snow are so strong.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You little brats.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Even the golden pill.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How is that possible?

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you crazy?

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're so quick-witted.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You shouldn't have used it on me.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're so smart.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're so smart.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're so smart.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You shouldn't have used it on me.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're so smart.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Unlike the two idiots.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They got it so easily.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If it weren't for the damn needle and needle.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You brats.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're not good enough for me.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You bastard.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Look at what I did today.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you see this red pill?

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you say another word.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll put all your fat into this pill.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This isn't your life-saving pill.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You bastard.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You bastard.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This red pill is ancient.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's very effective for your cultivation.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This pill can help you to break your cultivation.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I didn't expect the black blind.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
To have such a rare pill.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ordinary pills don't need to be consumed.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But this pill needs your cultivation.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Compared to your current cultivation.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not that easy to absorb high-grade pills.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you don't have enough cultivation.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You'll be in trouble.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But don't worry.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm here.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No surprise.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're good.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This red pill is very effective.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He didn't die from the red pill.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He just broke through.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So what?

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You can't break through.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You can't break through.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Spirit of the Qingzhang.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's still breaking through.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't expect his cultivation.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
To be so effective.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You bastard.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I didn't expect you to be so effective.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He just broke through.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You bastard.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so good.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are so bad.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How can you break through?

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You bastard.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You bastard.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You bastard.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You bastard.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There is no way to break through.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You bastard.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You bastard.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,140
A Youkai ego

148
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,660
Lighting my damn consult

149
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,140
Four Dragons volume

150
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,180
M Undead vasho should be interupted by four dragons volume

151
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Nice

152
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
We're even

153
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,600
You've made my brother angry.

154
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
You've kicked the iron plate.

155
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Since you love the elixir so much,

156
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
why don't you practice your own elixir?

157
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,280
Let's go.

158
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
Wake up! Look!

159
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,800
Isn't that Senior Hong Yi?

160
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
Why did he light the Red Eye Charging Talisman?

161
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
It's Tang Batian, that bastard!

162
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,600
Poor thing.

163
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,600
Even the elixir was taken away.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
The dead will survive.

165
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,840
The bastard is back to life.

166
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,240
Little fairy, get me a Martial Soul.

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
Martial Souls are all replaced by the beasts.

168
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
I'll give it to you.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Don't you dare to fool me.

170
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,560
Don't you dare to live.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
What kind of Martial Soul is this?

172
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
Yin Liang is so powerful.

173
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,960
I'm very interested in your new Martial Soul.

174
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,680
This is Martial Soul.

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,440
It's interesting.

176
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,440
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,600
