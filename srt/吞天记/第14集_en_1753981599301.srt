1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In the twilight world,

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
a young man

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in white

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
has gone to the mountain

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and the world has been

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
torn into half,

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the moon is

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
over the green boat

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and the mountains are

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why is the sky changing so fast?

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why is the sky changing so fast?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It seems to be going to rain.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Heaven and Earth is merciless.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will rule the world.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will rule the world.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will rule the world.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a person from the East God Country.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They are real.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If His Majesty wants to marry the princess to the East God Country,

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If His Majesty wants to marry the princess to the East God Country,

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
he is a strong nation.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's freaking me out!

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why isn't the fire here?

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Did Dongyue

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
You don't take me seriously.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Your Majesty,

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,120
His Majesty doesn't know you're here today.

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
That's why he's late.

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,880
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,920
Let's have a feast.

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,320
You don't have to do that.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
I want to see the princess.

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
Go and get the princess.

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Yes.

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes.

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,800
Princess.

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,480
Your Majesty.

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,640
Wu You, long time no see.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
You look good.

77
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,160
You're a good match for me.

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Come back to Dongsheng with me tomorrow.

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Tomorrow?

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,880
What?

81
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
You have a problem?

82
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,360
Well...

83
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
After the engagement,

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
he suddenly...

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Shut up.

86
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
If you don't behave,

87
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,800
I'll kill you.

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,640
Ni Chang.

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,800
Duan Tie Jiuchong.

90
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Who are you?

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,280
The supervisor of the Heaven Sword Sect,

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,320
Sun Daojiu.

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Why is he everywhere?

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Don't ruin my good thing.

95
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
A useless man like Duan Tie Jiuchong

96
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,520
can be the supervisor of the Heaven Sword Sect.

97
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,400
There's no one in the Heaven Sword Sect.

98
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,720
You can be the king of the country.

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
How can I be the supervisor of the country?

100
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
You're disrespectful to the king.

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,600
Come on.

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,320
Kill him.

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Soul-destroying Slash.

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,600
There's no one in Dongsheng.

105
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
The guards are so weak.

106
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,640
You...

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll settle the score with you later.

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,800
Yuan, I ask you.

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Can I take this man away tomorrow?

110
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Or not?

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
Take him away.

112
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Of course.

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,320
It's no difference between a few days earlier and a few days later.

114
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,160
No difference.

115
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Majesty.

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm not ready yet.

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
Please take back your order

118
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
and settle the score.

119
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,880
What?

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Do you want to go back on your word?

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
You don't want to marry me?

122
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,760
Today, the two countries have a deal.

123
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
The Ninth Lord changed his wife.

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't you take the Eastern Courtyard's royal family into consideration?

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
I'll send someone tomorrow.

126
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,520
Otherwise, I'll take all the things we discussed.

127
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,240
Please wait, Ninth Lord.

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
We'll discuss it later.

129
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
Wu You.

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,320
Don't think I don't know that you want to stall time

131
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,400
to seduce Sun Shangxian.

132
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
How can a princess of the Eastern Courtyard

133
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
be so shameless?

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
You want to piss me off

135
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
so that you can inherit my throne?

136
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
To be honest,

137
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,480
I've been a fan of the princess for a long time.

138
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,120
Now I want to compete with the Ninth Lord for a beauty.

139
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,960
Shangxian.

140
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,920
You...

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
I disagree.

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,800
I absolutely disagree.

143
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,400
I've made up my mind.

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,440
Goodbye.

145
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,440
It's the opposite.

146
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,360
It's the opposite.

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,040
They're all going to piss me off.

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
It seems that Wu You has already

149
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
pulled Sun Daojiao down.

150
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,200
What should we do, Mother?

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
A Sun Daojiao

152
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,360
won't let him

153
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,640
die in the hands of the Mages.

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
That's right.

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
We're still holding

156
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,240
the lives of the Mages.

157
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
You little girl.

158
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,840
Now it's up to you

159
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,560
whether you dare to defy me or not.

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm afraid Sun Daojiao

161
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,240
is suspicious of the Immortal's Envoy's Conference.

162
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
You mean...

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
We should hold her back.

164
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
If she dares to stop us,

165
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,480
she'll be killed.

166
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Yes, Master.

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
What do you think of the princess?

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
She's a little selfish.

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
But she's not as good as the Immortal.

170
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
The Immortal is the medicine for the Shilang.

171
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,640
Shut up.

172
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
What if that girl

173
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,720
doesn't want to go with you tomorrow?

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
That woman is dependent on my Dongshen Qi.

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,240
She can't go without her.

176
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,880
That's great.

177
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,080
All right.

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm going to the Envoy's Conference.

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,520
The Immortal's Envoy is so fragrant.

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
Women.

181
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
It's delicious.

182
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,520
Sir.

183
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
Come on.

184
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,640
Sir, come and play.

185
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Come on.

186
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,360
Keep your voice down.

187
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Dare to cause trouble for me.

188
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,560
Die.

189
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Open your mouth.

190
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Beauty.

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
My beauty.

192
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
We've been looking for three days.

193
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,560
We can't even see a shadow.

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,160
Immortal.

195
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,360
Where did that old witch

196
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
hide her?

197
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Blood Star.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,880
What's wrong, Immortal?

199
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,080
You go back first.

200
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,400
It's Gui Xiu's way of picking up sound.

201
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
How dare she do such a terrible thing

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,920
in Dongyue City?

203
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
I won't forgive her.

204
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,160
Mind your own business.

205
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,720
Gui.

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,920
Kill her.

207
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,400
Gui.

208
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,480
Kill her.

209
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,600
Gui.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760
Today,

211
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,720
we'll never get away.

212
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,880
Brother Luo.

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You lure them here.

214
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,360
Let's kill them all together.

215
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,000
The evil card is gone.

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,280
Five swords are combined.

217
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,800
The immortal sword breaks the heaven.

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,720
Meng Yi.

219
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,480
Zi Yan.

220
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,960
I won't spare any of them.

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
