It's too hard to break through to the ninth round of the competition.

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I know a place, maybe there is a chance.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Wu Yu, you are so lucky.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
You even got the flower lantern festival that is one year old.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Is there really a treasure here that can improve your strength?

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Of course there is.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
But it depends on your luck.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Look, the flowers are about to bloom.

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Niao Zulan, look at me.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Look at me.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Don't bully people.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
That's my wife.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
The wind rises, the flowers fall.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
It's been a day since we met, it's like three years.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I wonder if Sister Hua can come and travel with us.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
If Mr. Mo wants to meet, I will be happy.

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Beautiful, beautiful.

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Hurry up, hurry up.

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
You are so fast.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You are a good student.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Wu Yu, don't get too close to her.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
You are so bad.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Young Master, Wu Yu is here to collect the treasure.

54
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Ming Lang, don't miss the important thing.

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Uncle, if Wu Yu doesn't leave, the important thing will become a trouble sooner or later.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Mr. Mo, Sister Qing Wang, no, Sister Qing Wang.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Taste this monkey head.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Take it.

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
No, who knows if you have put the medicine in it.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Little devil, I always feel that this fruit has something to do with me.

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Then you take it.

62
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,200
And, you little rascal, if you dare to do anything, I will blow you to death.

63
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
How much is this?

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Mr. Wu, you are killing me.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
This bad fruit is hard to get your money.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
As long as you like it, the whole stall is yours.

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I will take a leave.

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Then, one seed.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Okay.

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I will give you ten seeds.

71
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Situ Ming Lang, you finally can't sit still.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't worry.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
There are many treasures in the hands of the Gongsun Elder.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
But no one dares to kill people here.

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Moreover, here, you have to pay attention to the price.

76
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I, I don't want money.

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
No, you want money.

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
This monkey head fruit is beautiful and full of spiritual power.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
How to say, you want thirty snacks, right?

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Okay, then thirty snacks.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Thirty snacks?

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You can only use magic weapons if you can afford a bottle of spirit energy.

83
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
This rotten fruit is not worth this money.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I said it was worth it.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
It is worth it.

86
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I want to see what you have.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Forty snacks.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Mr. Yu wakes up early every day to go to the back hill to pick up.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
It's hard work.

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Then you have to pay twenty more snacks.

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
You are right.

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Then sixty snacks.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Seventy.

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Seventy is not good.

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Mr. Yu can do business.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Of course, you have to put a good one.

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Eighty-eight.

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay, listen to you.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I give you eighty-eight.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
One hundred.

101
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Congratulations, Situ Ming Lang.

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
With one hundred snacks, you have a treasure.

103
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Congratulations.

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Wu Yu, you want this rotten fruit so much.

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
What are you going to exchange it for?

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
I didn't say I wanted it.

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,200
I spent one hundred yuan on a rotten fruit.

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
This is Situ Ming Lang.

109
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
You are playing with me.

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Wu Yu, how dare you humiliate me in the public?

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Then I will have a good contact with you.

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
My flowers.

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm so angry.

114
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Situ Ming Lang is so famous.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
He is so good at chasing a dead body.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Situ Ming Lang, you are so bad at this.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Do you think I lack money?

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I just lack a reason to do it.

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
You can't escape.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Wu Yu, you can't escape today.

122
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Why is Elder Gongsun still not here?

123
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
It's normal for children to fight and make trouble.

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
The treasure valley is not allowed to have trouble.

125
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Elder Gongsun, don't you really want to give Situ Hui a face?

126
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Come on, Elder Gongsun, it's your turn.

127
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Why is it useless?

128
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Sister Hua, can you give me a face later?

129
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Let's go to the boat together.

130
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Everything is arranged by Mr. Mo.

131
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I will follow you.

132
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Be careful.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Today is a rare day.

134
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Someone dares to make trouble in the treasure valley.

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Uncle Mo, you want to meddle in the evil things.

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Since you call me uncle,

137
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I will recognize you as a teacher.

138
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Good teacher, you should leave now.

140
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Don't spoil my mood.

141
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
No one dares to take advantage of me until now.

142
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Thank you, Brother Mo.

143
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
You want to touch my people.

144
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Your opponent is me.

145
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Then I will let you fight.

146
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I will not take advantage of you.

147
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
What do you want to do?

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
I was already famous a year ago.

149
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Do you think you have the right to fight with me after you have some experience?

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Some red hooks are the ones you will never get in your life.

151
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
I will kill you.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
How could you break through the nine walls of the斷剑?

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
You are a demon.

154
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I have no intention to be a demon.

155
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
I will destroy you.

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I will kill you.

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I will kill you.

158
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Good. Good. Good.

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Today is the day of the teacher.

160
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I don't want to save you.

161
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Come on.

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Mom.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Mom, I miss you so much.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Naive.

165
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Wu Yu.

166
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Impossible.

167
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Resurrection after death.

168
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
You are disappointed.

169
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I don't die so easily.

170
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I don't die so easily.

171
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I will die if I don't die.

172
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You are really alive.

173
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Xia, get me a Martial Soul.

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Martial Soul is replaced by beasts.

175
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I will give it to you.

176
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
You are not a demon.

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You are not alive.

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
What Martial Soul are you?

179
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
You are so powerful.

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
I am very interested in your new Martial Soul.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
This is Martial Soul.

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
It's interesting.

183
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
I will kill you.

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I will kill you.

185
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
