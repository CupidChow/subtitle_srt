1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Through a bitch like you…

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Understood

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dear me

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Worn out

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
국家

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Young men

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Like you

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They may��

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Speak

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Two

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
of them

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They moved

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Down to the forest

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

58
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

59
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm not sure if I can do it.

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,140
I'm not sure if I can do it.

61
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,220
I'm not sure if I can do it.

62
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,140
No, no.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Your Highness.

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Finally,

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,240
we made it.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Father and Mother are all here.

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
They must be happy now.

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Your Highness.

69
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Highness.

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,560
Uncle Zhu,

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,560
your hand.

72
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,600
This is my badge of honor.

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
My honor.

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,040
Don't worry.

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,560
I'll take it for you.

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Your Highness.

78
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Father, it's really Crown Prince Yu.

79
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,600
You brat.

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,320
You're too loud.

81
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,480
Be more reserved.

82
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
Crown Prince Yu is back.

83
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640
We'll have a better life.

84
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,400
It's the monkey.

85
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,440
Master, come here.

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,280
You brat.

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,840
You stole my gourd last time.

88
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
I haven't paid you back yet.

89
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
You're so noisy.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
I just checked your background.

91
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,680
You killed the Yuan clan.

92
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,280
You're quite capable.

93
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Who are you?

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,880
You deserve to know

95
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
my name.

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
You're the one who killed the Yuan clan.

97
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
You're the one who killed the Yuan clan.

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
You're the one who killed the Yuan clan.

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
You're here to avenge

100
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
Yuan Chen and Haotian?

101
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Avenge?

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,560
They deserve it.

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
I'm just not used to

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,520
people who are good at fighting.

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
You're not my opponent.

106
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
If you leave now,

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
you might save your life.

108
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,560
I've seen a lot of

109
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,600
people who are good at talking.

110
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,640
You think you can beat me?

111
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
You're so greedy.

112
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
You're so greedy.

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,840
Zhongwu, let's leave.

114
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,680
Come with me.

115
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
Let's go.

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,240
Go.

117
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
You're so mean.

118
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
How is that possible?

119
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Wen Yu.

120
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
You killed the Daoist disciples of the Yuan clan.

121
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
You're going to hurt me.

122
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Next time,

123
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,840
I'll make sure you die.

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Now that the Yuan clan is dead,

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,440
the country will be in chaos.

126
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Ayu.

127
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Sister.

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,160
I know what you're trying to say.

129
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,120
But

130
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
I've already set foot on the path of cultivation.

131
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Cultivators

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,320
shouldn't interfere with the affairs of the mortal world.

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,920
So you should take the position.

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
But there's no female leader in this valley.

135
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
Then let me open the box.

136
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,800
Sister.

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
I have something to show you.

138
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Close your eyes first.

139
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
What's that?

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
You're so mysterious.

141
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Ayu.

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,520
Are you ready?

143
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,800
Ayu.

144
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Long live the King of the Five Kingdoms.

145
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Long live the King of the Five Kingdoms.

146
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Hurry up, Granny.

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,480
Or it'll be too late.

148
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,160
My legs.

149
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Can I get up quickly?

150
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,200
Brother, here he comes.

151
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,960
It's His Majesty.

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
It's His Majesty.

153
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
It's His Majesty.

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
His Majesty is here.

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
His Majesty.

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
His Majesty.

157
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
His Majesty.

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
His Majesty.

159
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
His Majesty.

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
His Majesty.

161
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
His Majesty.

162
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
His Majesty.

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Today the day of the元 period.

164
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,120
The new day is about to be born.

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
banned with peace and pink.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
May His Majesty have good fortune.

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,840
May His Majesty have good fortune.

168
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,760
May His Majesty have good fortune.

169
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,880
May His Majesty have good fortune.

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
May His Majesty have good fortune.

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
May His Majesty have good fortune.

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm lucky.

173
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,120
will be with my people

174
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
share the happiness

175
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,000
together and Ci EUR

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Your Majesty!

177
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Your Majesty!

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,760
His Majesty is about to be married.

179
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
My girl,

180
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,040
how old are you?

181
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,520
Your Majesty!

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Your Majesty!

183
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
Your Majesty!

184
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,360
Stop!

185
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Father, Uncle Zhong,

186
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,760
please let me and my mother in.

187
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,080
We'll stay here.

188
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
We won't be late.

189
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,440
No.

190
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,280
As His Majesty's son,

191
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
I won't be a fool.

192
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,200
You brat!

193
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,240
Don't think I'm your father.

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
I'll open the back door for you.

195
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't think about it.

196
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,880
You're different from the bulls.

197
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
You're a good man.

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,680
Uncle Zhong,

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
you're a good man.

200
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
I'll figure it out.

201
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,960
You want this?

202
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,400
Here you are.

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
It's so beautiful.

204
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,960
Do you want it?

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,360
Yes.

206
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,840
Thank you.

207
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,120
You're so kind.

208
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,400
Granny,

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,720
are you a fairy

210
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,280
who comes to the mortal world to burn?

211
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
You brat,

212
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,200
your saliva is coming out.

213
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,680
Your Majesty!

214
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
Senior Sister?

215
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,520
You're a good spy.

216
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
You kill demons and protect the right path.

217
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,720
It's my duty.

218
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
The Immortal Sects are in a state of panic.

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The Immortal Sects are in a state of panic.

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Master has called back

221
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
the Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom.

222
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,920
So this time,

223
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm here to congratulate you

224
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
and to pick you up.

225
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,560
A state of panic?

226
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,320
You'll know when you get back.

227
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
When can I see you again

228
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,720
after you leave?

229
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
I'll be back after I finish

230
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
the thing about the Immortal Sects.

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll wait for you.

232
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
It's late.

233
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,240
Uncle Zhong,

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Sister Ni Chang,

235
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,800
I'll leave you to it.

236
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Don't worry, Your Highness.

237
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,720
I'll protect His Majesty.

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
Master Dao?

239
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
You brat,

240
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
come and play with me again.

241
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Yu,

242
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
