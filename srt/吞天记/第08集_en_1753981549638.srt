1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
I'm afraid we need to do something.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
He doesn't believe much.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 16

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What is this?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The spirit worm?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Didn't it get destroyed by the Dao Sect Leader of the Central Plains?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How could Situ She have it?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is the place where the monster was controlled by the mountain of Bibo.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Could it be related to the spirit worm?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Third Brother, please investigate it.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, I'll leave you two alone.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Wind up, flower fall.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Brother Mo, those two sisters are still in the treasure valley.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
My flower!

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wind up!

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're participating in the selection of the Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Situ Ming Lang will definitely try to stop you.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I suggest you should keep your head down.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you for your warning.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I will definitely win this competition.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, it's so boring.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What kind of competition is this? Why isn't it starting yet?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom has arrived.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:29,040
Councillor of Akina

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Are you sure about that?

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,060
Summit

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Let's start.

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,600
Graphics

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
For those who hurt people,

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,040
you need to remove all your cultivation

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,440
The competition begins!

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,640
I've been practicing for decades in the tribe.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
It's really hard to endure.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,920
I want to go down the mountain to visit the common people.

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,360
Please give me a favor.

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,760
What favor?

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
This sword skill is so easy to use.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
It's not as powerful as a mountain.

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Next one.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Wu Yu,

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
the competition has already begun.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,280
You're still practicing?

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm getting better.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,960
Why are you so anxious to return to Dongyue State?

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,880
I've been practicing for years.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,080
It's time to go home and see him.

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Next one.

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Wu Yu.

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
You're so weak.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
Get out of here.

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Or I'll beat you to death.

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Next one.

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm afraid no one can beat him in peace.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
One to four.

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,320
Wu Yu will definitely lose.

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,200
You're so clumsy.

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,400
How shameless!

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
Let's start.

78
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,280
Combine!

79
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
Golden Night Slash!

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
Wu Yu, you're great!

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Congratulations to Wu Yu for defeating everyone

82
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
and becoming the Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,080
Wait.

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
He's not even a spirit.

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,600
How can he be the Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom?

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,080
No matter what his level is,

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,920
as long as he beats everyone

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,200
and passes the competition,

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,280
the title of Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,520
is his.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
According to Elder Mu Ge,

92
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,280
if everyone doesn't participate,

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,000
and he chooses a single-body insect,

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,920
do you think he's qualified to become

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,040
the Supervisor of the Immortal Kingdom?

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,520
You're just trying to get away.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm just trying to show respect to the Immortal Sect.

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Ming Lang, you're almost at the second level.

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,840
It seems that you've been working hard these days.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Thank you for your guidance, Master.

101
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,000
Then go on stage.

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,520
Let me see your skills.

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,880
Wu Yu, I let you escape from the Duobao Valley.

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,920
What tricks can you play this time?

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Just hit me.

106
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
Stop talking nonsense.

107
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me see

108
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,800
if your strength

109
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
can beat your tough mouth.

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,900
oki say

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,660
Tobin

112
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,160
How could you��

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,060
bettemby

114
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,160
use such beautiful disguises?

115
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,260
I'm not scared at all.

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,500
The center of attention is above the target.

117
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,100
No one will expose me

118
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
with an un Stark shouted.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
If it wasn't someone voorges you,

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
you'd already be dead.

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You've lived for a year.

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
You deserve it.

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Chaos is like a mirror.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
No luck is empty.

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Open the sword!

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Great! We won again!

127
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Very good.

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
You succeeded.

129
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You're making fun of me.

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Thunder Demon Body!

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
I'll never die!

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Hey!

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:52,700
Ar

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Sutesuhour?

135
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,880
How dare you use the Demon emblem in prostate storage!

136
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
But Father!

137
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I'm dead!

138
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,820
Ha ha ha ha!

139
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,200
Thus it was believed that ZF known fights with the Devil

140
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,640
But his sword is matchless with his enemy

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,440
Notwithstanding, he is more suitable for give attacks

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,800
Surrendered,Kysole looked extremely powerful

143
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Another great performance

144
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,380

145
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,380
Man yi wu

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,540
Go help him

147
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Poor thing.

148
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Die!

149
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
You brat.

150
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,540
You're asking for my help again.

151
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
First,

152
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,540

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
Change!

154
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
It's your turn.

155
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Congratulations on becoming the manager of the TianTing waste management center.

156
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
Waste management center?

157
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Sister Yang, I'm here to collect waste.

158
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
In the future, in TianTing,

159
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I'll teach you.

160
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
If you want to become strong,

161
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
collect more waste.

162
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Become the strongest in the three realms.

163
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540

I'm sorry.

171
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm sorry.
