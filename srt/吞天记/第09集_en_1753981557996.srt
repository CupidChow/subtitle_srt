I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The moon is full of green, the mountains are lonely

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The road ahead is not long, the wind is laughing at me, I am too crazy

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The mountain is still hanging, the heart is beating

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Only one piece of paper is as old as a gold

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I dare to break through the night

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind, the snow, the moon, the people, the peach blossoms

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But after many years, everything is a principles

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But in the end, I am bold and clever

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000

Haven't been forgotten

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Situ Ming Lang is not even close to the winner.

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't you care about the elders?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
Come on, Wu Yu!

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Fight him!

39
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,480
Elder Mu Ge.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,560
The match is not over yet.

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,800
Stop struggling.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,720
I will use your blood and flesh

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,560
to destroy my immortal gorge.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
Thunderous Fight!

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,160
The sky is too dark.

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,600
Golden Light,

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,160
Dragon Silver,

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
and Immortal Gorge.

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Yang Zhuang!

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Brother,

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
you are so talented.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I've done so much,

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
but why...

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
why am I still like this?

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
You've already been possessed by fire.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,160
You killed Situ Ming Lang in a moment?

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Wu Yu, you are so good!

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Ming Lang, don't worry.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
I will avenge you.

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Stop!

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Be careful!

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Wu Yu!

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Enough.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Welcome, Elder.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
This is the end

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
of this fight.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Elder, Wu Yu killed Situ Ming Lang.

68
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Situ Ming Lang should be expelled from the cultivation

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
and expelled from the clan.

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
You think so?

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Situ Ming Lang has been possessed.

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
He should be killed.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
But,

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
Wu Yu has committed a murder.

75
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
He should be punished.

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Please punish him.

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
He will be punished.

78
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Wu Yu,

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
do you know your crime?

80
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
I will punish him.

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
I have no guilt.

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
You are so good at killing.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
I have no guilt.

84
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Wu Yu,

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
get up now.

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
You are the fifth disciple

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
of the Snow-Cloaked Cliff.

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Let's pay our respects.

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Wu Yu,

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
pay our respects.

91
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Have I said it's over?

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
It's been found that

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
the beast controlled by the Bibo Mountains

94
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
was done by Elder Situ.

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Elder, I am innocent.

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
You won't wrong people.

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I am late.

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
I didn't see you show off.

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's get to the point.

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
These magical worms

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
and the medicine that made the beast lose control

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
were found in Elder Situ's mansion.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
It's Elder Situ.

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Elder,

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
it's too hasty to punish someone

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
who is not a master.

107
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
The magical worms come from the Dao Sect of the Central Plains.

108
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
The master of the family still wants to protect them.

109
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I dare not.

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Elder Situ

111
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
is involved in colluding with the Dao Sect of the Central Plains.

112
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Elder Wu Ge,

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
take him to investigate.

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Yes.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Wu Yu,

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
although the immortal path is dangerous,

117
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
don't be blind to pursue your strength

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
and lose your true nature.

119
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I will remember your teachings.

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Old man,

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
no one will disturb you anymore.

122
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I will be back tomorrow.

123
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I will be back tomorrow.

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I will be back tomorrow.

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
I don't know when I can come back to visit you.

126
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Elder,

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
if you are bored by yourself,

128
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,160
please dream of me.

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I miss you.

130
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
You little rascal,

131
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
you just left without saying goodbye?

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
I have been dying for a lifetime.

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Rather than adding to my grief,

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I'd rather be forgotten in the martial arts world.

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Junior Brother,

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
you can use the things in the virtual world.

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
This time, the Eastern Yue State

138
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
represents the Tong Tian Sword Sect.

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Please be careful.

140
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Senior Sister, don't worry.

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
I have my own rules.

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Don't look at me.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
All these years,

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
I have been using the beauty

145
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
that raised me with the beauty of the snowy wind.

146
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
I finally caught up.

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Thank you, Rascal.

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Let me give Sister a taste.

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Sister?

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
You said it yourself.

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
It's time to go home and see her.

152
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Don't tell me it's fake.

153
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
It's real.

154
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I didn't expect you to be so affectionate.

155
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
That's my sister.

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Qingma,

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
why did you say that

158
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,160
I am like a wolf that is everywhere to pick flowers and grass?

159
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,160
There is no one who knows the way to the end of the world.

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Who is the world's person who does not know the world?

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Junior Brother,

162
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
I will give you a taste.

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Everyone,

164
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,160
I will take my leave.

165
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Be careful on the way.

166
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Don't forget to bring me something.

167
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Eastern Yue State,

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I am coming.

169
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Come in.

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Kneel.

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Bow.

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Bow.

173
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,160
The emperor and the demon are all bowing.

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
The immortal is in a hurry.

175
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,160
He is welcomed.

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
The victory is over.

177
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Love the people and laugh at the great power.

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
That's great.

179
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
After the ceremony,

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Eastern Yue State will be in a good mood.

181
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
The state is peaceful.

182
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes.

183
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
With Emperor Yuan Hao and Empress Dowager Yuan Xi as the formation,

184
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
not to mention the small countries around,

185
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,160
even the evil demon is not enough to be feared.

186
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Shut up.

187
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Now the evil people of Eastern Yue State are in charge.

188
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
They are all in chaos.

189
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
They are all ignorant.

190
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
It's so sad.

191
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Emperor Yuan Hao is a hero.

193
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
How can he be a villain?

194
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
He is a hero?

195
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
You have never seen the Crown Prince.

196
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,160
The son of the Marshal Wu was in chaos in the imperial city.

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
He killed him without saying a word.

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
That's what you call a hero.

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Yuan Hao is nothing compared to him.

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
You...

201
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
You dare to mention the name of the traitor?

202
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
He was suddenly burned to the ground

203
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
and was sent to the frontier.

204
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Nonsense.

205
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I am his soldier.

206
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,160
The beauty of the South Mountain State was like the clouds.

207
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
The Crown Prince didn't even look at her.

208
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
He was definitely framed.

209
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Do you know what the inside story is?

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
You like to talk so much.

211
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Then you should talk in front of His Majesty.

212
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I am sorry.

213
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I am sorry.

214
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
I am sorry.

215
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
I am sorry.

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
I am sorry.

217
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I am sorry.

218
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
I am sorry.

219
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I am sorry.

220
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I am sorry.

221
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I am sorry.

222
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I am sorry.

223
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I am sorry.

224
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I am sorry.

225
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I am sorry.

226
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
I am sorry.

227
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I am sorry.

228
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
I am sorry.

229
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
I am sorry.
